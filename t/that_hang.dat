5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a snood, <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> {{from the top of}} the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, the trees are particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E

25|$|A {{revolving}} door has {{three or four}} doors <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> on a center shaft and rotate around a vertical axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, the {{revolving door}} was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented the revolving door on August 7, 1888.|$|E
25|$|Paixtles {{is one of}} the few pre Hispanic dances {{to remain}} free from European influence, mostly {{performed}} in Jalisco and Nayarit. Participants cover themselves with the moss that hangs from Montezuma Cypress trees and carry staves which have the head of a deer at one end. They accompany themselves with maracas that they carry. Dancers wear masks to cover the face and ribbons <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> from the head.|$|E
25|$|B.rosseraes {{relationship}} to other Banksia species is uncertain. Its leaves are virtually indistinguishable from narrow-leaved forms of B.laevigata (Tennis Ball Banksia), and like that species it has condensed, roughly spherical inflorescences, and slender styles. However, unlike B.laevigata {{it has a}} lignotuber, and terminal inflorescences <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> down instead of being held erect. The lignotuber suggests an affinity with B.lullfitzii, while the pendulous inflorescences suggest {{a relationship with the}} Banksia ser. Tetragonae series.|$|E

25|$|Table olive {{varieties}} {{are more difficult}} to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.|$|E
25|$|The Zacapoaxtlas {{stand out}} {{because they have the}} most {{elaborate}} and costly costumes. They dress as charros, which suits heavily decorated in sequins, a wig with the colors of the Mexican flag and a black cape. Representing the troops of General Zaragoza in the Battle of Puebla, they wear green, white and red paper streamers <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> off the back of their hats. Their suits are elaborated embroidered and sequined which has been hand done. These outfits have been valued at about 30,000 and sometimes as high as 50,000 pesos.|$|E
25|$|Some bands use small notebooks, {{also known}} as a dot book or drill book, which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|E

25|$|Compared to filters <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> on {{the back}} of the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E
25|$|Another ambitious {{restoration}} effort {{began in}} 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors {{worked together to}} refurbish the 15,876 Minton tiles <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> on {{the ceiling of the}} Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, the ceiling of the Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles. Made by Minton and Company, a leading 19th-century ceramic manufacturer in England, the ceiling tiles are divided into 49 panels, each containing 324 tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their backing plates so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s. The tiles sat in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy received a generous private donation for their restoration. The Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort to return the Minton tiles to their original luster in 2004. A team of seven conservation technicians cleaned and repaired more than 14,000 original tiles by hand. Only three panels of replica tiles were needed to replace those that had been damaged beyond repair. For those recreations, the Conservancy decided to commission Maw and Company, Minton's successor in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled to much fanfare in March 2007. In 2006, the Conservancy completed a nine-month renovation of the Mall in a project that returned the landscape to its original character and ensured the protection of its great American Elms.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields <b>that</b> <b>hang</b> {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
