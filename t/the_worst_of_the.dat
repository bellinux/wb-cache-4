5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm is over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. <b>The</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{damage from the}} hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas {{where there was no}} protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E

In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many were {{relieved}} {{to have survived}} <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Category4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness {{due to lack of}} information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
