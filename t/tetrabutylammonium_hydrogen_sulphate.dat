40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine, mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate or <b>tetrabutylammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt. It was observed that additions in mobile phase of smaller size ions such {{as in the case of}} tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate and <b>tetrabutylammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> had as a result k’ co-efficient reductions, evidently due to its smaller ion solvency compared to that of the <b>tetrabutylammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> ions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} further {{anaerobic digestion}} of already digested sludge by processing in an airlift bioreactor. Anaerobic digestion {{is commonly used}} for nutrient and energy recovery from biomass. It is used to breakdown organic matter into methane(CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> (H 2 S), and digested sludge, which is used for fertilizer, through four biodegradation stages. The rate of gas generation through mesophilic anaerobic digestion is generally higher, yet, the remaining dissolved gases in a digested sludge have a pejorative {{effect on the environment}} when they are eventually released, as well as causing operational difficulties. Moreover, the generation of biogas continuously in an already digested sludge increases cavitation phenomena and the accompanying pump load. Removal of these gases is investigated by a bubbling system. An airlift bioreactor (ALR) is used as anaerobic digester in the present research to remove produced methane, carbon dioxide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> (H 2 S) from digested sludge, consequently, reducing pathogens and odour as well as improvement digested sludge for fertilizer.

In addition, using an airlift reactor enhances the mixing efficiency. The process preferable to agitation as in conventional stirred tanks on power consumption grounds.
