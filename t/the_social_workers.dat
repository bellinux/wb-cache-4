500|$|From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié {{to sleep}} in a bin liner in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her {{frequent}} bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, [...] "it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.|$|E
2500|$|Although he was 78 {{years old}} when he left the NLRB in 1998, Truesdale {{continued}} to work as an arbitrator—and continued to make headlines. [...] One such ruled came in the Banita Jacks case. In 2008, Jacks was found guilty of starving and then murdering her four children (aged 5 to 16). Four days after the bodies were found, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty fired six employees of Washington's Child and Family Services Agency, saying they [...] "just didn't do their job." [...] Three of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> filed grievances with the city. [...] Truesdale was assigned to the case as an arbitrator. [...] In September 2008, Truesdale issued an opinion in which he ruled that all three had been illegally terminated. Truesdale ordered the city to rehire <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> at the same pay and benefit grades, expunge the incident from their personnel records, and give them back pay (with interest) and benefits for the period while they were terminated.|$|E
