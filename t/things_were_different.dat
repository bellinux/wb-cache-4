5|$|<b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> in {{the county}} matches. As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests, he {{generally}} gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition {{in the county}} matches, and the three spinners Ring, Johnson and McCool did more of the work, especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests. Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> for the wealthy. Before {{the meal}} and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as {{cleanliness}} was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> in Georgia, where Governor Eugene Talmadge {{declared}} {{martial law}} in {{the third week of}} the strike and directed the National Guard to arrest all picketers throughout the state, holding them in a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state only interned a hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, {{there was}} another mass-conviction of Doukhobors {{relating}} to arsons. In response, BC Penitentiary set up a self-contained compound for these prisoners adjacent to the main penitentiary. Whereas the experience on Peirce Island was mostly peaceful, this time <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different.</b> The prisoners set the compound on fire twice in 1951, the latter time mostly destroying it. The Doukhobor prisoners were then moved to the main prison, where they participated in a 35-day hunger strike that ended with forced-feedings.|$|E
25|$|UCLA's two big streaks {{came to an}} end {{during the}} 1973–1974 season. In January, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when Digger Phelps's Notre Dame squad upended the Bruins 71–70 in South Bend. Two months later, Norm Sloan's North Carolina State team {{defeated}} UCLA 80–77 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. David Thompson was NC State's All-American, and Tom Burleson did an excellent job on defense against Bill Walton. UCLA had beaten the Wolfpack by 18 points early in the season, but <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> when they met in March.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> on radio then. They got {{enormous}} laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

25|$|The {{expectations}} were also plentiful as Red Star, Serbia-Montenegro league champion, {{was getting ready}} to start Champions League qualifying. After easily progressing from the initial stage versus Irish champions Cork City, they were drawn against powerhouse AC Milan in the final qualifying round, putting up decent resistance en route to 1–3 aggregate loss. Despite the failure to get into the Champions League, many still took some positives from the Milan clash, however <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different</b> when Bajević's squad got eliminated from UEFA Cup in first round by Slovan Liberec with embarrassing ease (1–4 on aggregate, including the 1–2 loss at home) thus failing to reach the group stage.|$|E
25|$|International motor racing at Silverstone is not {{concerned}} solely to Formula One, however, and 1976 {{saw one of}} the closest finished in endurance racing during the Silverstone Six-Hour race, which was a round of the World Championship for Makes. The series was almost a German benefit that season as the main contenders were the Porsche 935s and BMW 3-litre CSLs (common known as the 'Batmobiles'). Porsche had had the upper hand in the opening rounds of the series, but at Silverstone <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different.</b> John Fitzpatrick and Tom Walkinshaw kept their BMW ahead to win by 197 yards (1.18secs) from the Bob Wollek/Hans Heyer Porsche 935 Turbo. Third was a Porsche 934 Turbo in the hands of Leo Kinnunen and Egon Evertz.|$|E

500|$|Colonel Sun was broadly {{welcomed by}} the critics, {{although}} a number noted that despite Amis's abilities as a writer, Fleming's own persona {{was missing from}} the novel. Roger Baker, writing in The Times noted that from one angle Colonel Sun is a [...] "neat, not over-inventive thriller, low on sex, high on violence and more than usually improbable"; however, he noted that once {{the elements of the}} re-incarnation of Bond and the writing of Kingsley Amis were taken into account, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different.</b> Baker thought that with Amis writing the story, [...] "one might, justifiably, have expected a joyous rejuvenation or at least a devastating detour from the Fleming pattern. We get neither. It is a pale copy." [...] D. J. Enright, writing in The Listener, considered that, in literary terms, Fleming's [...] "inheritance has been well and aptly bestowed." [...] He said that [...] "Colonel Sun offers apt literary pabulum for Bond's fish-and-chip culture, for his neurotics, alcoholics and suicides. Good dirty fun, once read and soon forgotten".|$|E

2500|$|Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP {{have been}} {{dismissed}} as truisms or trivial tautologies—that is, statements true solely {{by virtue of their}} logical form (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying [...] "if <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>different,</b> they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.|$|E
