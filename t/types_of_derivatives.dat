For example, vulnerabilities included failure to regulate the risk-taking of the non-depository banking sector, the so-called shadow banks such as investment banks and mortgage companies. These companies had outgrown the regulated depository banking sector, but did not have the same safeguards. Further, financial connections were established between the depository banks and shadow banks (e.g., via securitization and special purpose entities) that created dependencies that were not well understood by regulators. Certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives,</b> essentially bets on the performance of other securities, remained largely unregulated and were another opaque source of dependencies.|$|E

50|$|A stock {{derivative}} is {{any financial}} instrument {{which has a}} value that {{is dependent on the}} price of the underlying stock. Futures and options are the main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> on stocks. The underlying security may be a stock index or an individual firm's stock, e.g. single-stock futures.|$|E

5000|$|A hedge is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative,</b> or a {{financial}} instrument, that derives its value from an underlying asset. Hedging {{is a way}} for a company to minimize or eliminate foreign exchange risk. Two common hedges are forward contracts and options.|$|R
30|$|The contact {{condition}} of transducers such as pressure and surface conditions was not controlled on purpose {{so it must}} be varied. Instead, two pretreatments were applied to minimize the effect of the contact condition: two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> scaling and two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> (1 st and 2 nd derivative).|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> with {{matrices}} {{that can}} be organized into a matrix of the same size. These are the derivative of a matrix by a scalar and the derivative of a scalar by a matrix respectively. These {{can be useful in}} minimization problems found in many areas of applied mathematics and have adopted the names tangent matrix and gradient matrix respectively after their analogs for vectors.|$|E
50|$|Keep in {{mind that}} various authors use {{different}} combinations of numerator and denominator layouts for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives,</b> {{and there is no}} guarantee that an author will consistently use either numerator or denominator layout for all types. Match up the formulas below with those quoted in the source to determine the layout used for that particular type of derivative, but be careful not to assume that derivatives of other types necessarily follow the same kind of layout.|$|E

Methylidynephosphane can be synthesised via {{the reaction of}} phosphine with carbon, but it is extremely reactive and polymerises readily at temperatures above −120 °C. However, several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives,</b> with bulky groups, such as tert-butyl or trimethylsilyl, substituted for the hydrogen atom, are much more stable, and are useful reagents for the synthesis of various organophosphorus compounds.

50|$|A film {{adaptation}} is {{the transfer}} of a written work, {{in whole or in}} part, to a feature film. Although often considered a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> work, recent academic developments by scholars such as Robert Stam conceptualize film adaptation as a dialogic process.|$|R
30|$|Recently, a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{fractional}} <b>derivative</b> {{was introduced}} by Caputo and Fabrizio in [18]. The reason of introducing this new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> was to search for fractional derivative with nonsingular kernel and without the Gamma function. Since then many researchers discussed this and applied this new fractional derivative to several real world phenomena and excellent results were reported [19 – 35]. On the other side the discrete version <b>of</b> fractional <b>derivative</b> is one <b>of</b> the interesting topics nowadays [19, 36 – 40]. Some of the applications of the discrete fractional Caputo derivative {{can be found in}} [41, 42].|$|R
50|$|Futures, options, {{and many}} other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{have been around for}} centuries: the Japanese rice futures market started trading around 1730. However, recent decades have seen an {{explosion}} use of derivatives and mathematically complicated securitization techniques. MacKenzie (2006) argues from a sociological point of view that mathematical formulas actually change the way that economic agents use and price assets. Economists, rather than acting as a camera taking an objective picture of the way the world works, actively change behavior by providing formulas that let dispersed agents agree on prices for new assets.|$|E
50|$|The three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{that have}} not been {{considered}} are those involving vectors-by-matrices, matrices-by-vectors, and matrices-by-matrices. These are not as widely considered and a notation is not widely agreed upon. As for vectors, the other two types of higher matrix derivatives can be seen as applications of the derivative of a matrix by a matrix by using a matrix with one column in the correct place. For this reason, in this subsection we consider only how one can write the derivative of a matrix by another matrix.|$|E
50|$|While {{understanding}} and trading derivatives required in-depth knowledge of derivatives structure and risks associated, managing those derivative contracts and related operations requires in-depth knowledge of market mechanics and systems used across industry. Derivatives {{have received a}} great deal of attention in recent years, new regulations such as Dodd-Frank Act has changed the landscape of the OTC derivatives market. It is critical that firms firmly understand new market structure, processes and systems to successfully manage their derivatives positions. This book is provides structured study material on life cycle of various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> contracts, operations and systems involved.|$|E
50|$|A quanto is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> {{in which}} the {{underlying}} is denominated in one currency,but the instrument itself is settled in another currency at some rate. Such products are attractive for speculators and investors who wish to have exposure to a foreign asset, but without the corresponding exchange rate risk.|$|R
50|$|In finance, partial return {{reverse swap}} (PRRS) is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> swap, a {{financial}} contract that transfers {{a percentage of}} both the credit risk and market risk of an underlying asset, usually half, while also transferring all of the ownership liabilities for estate planning, tax purposes, and insider trading rules.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{literature}} which {{examines the}} use <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> by investment managers does not discern between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> trading strategies. This {{study is the}} first to examine and gather data on a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivative</b> trading strategy undertaken by investment managers. We examine the extent to which equity fund managers use index futures to manage fund flows and the effect this has on their alpha and market timing measures of performance. Our results show that funds that do not use derivatives exhibit lower returns and negative market timing skills when they experience fund flow. The performance of funds that use derivatives, however, is independent of investor's liquidity demands. In fact, the unconditional performance of the average user fund is statistically equivalent to the performance of the average non-user fund conditional on zero fund flow. Our results provide evidence that derivatives can be beneficial for mutual fund holders under certain conditions. 9 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Some {{derivatives}} (especially swaps) expose {{investors to}} counterparty risk, or risk {{arising from the}} other party in a financial transaction. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk {{to have a certain}} amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help businesses swap variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of financialization has been the development of overleverage (more borrowed capital and less own capital) and, as a related tool, financial derivatives: financial instruments, the price or value of which {{is derived from the}} price or value of another, underlying financial instrument. Those instruments, whose initial purpose was hedging and risk management, have become widely traded financial assets in their own right. The most common <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> are futures contracts, swaps, and options. In the early 1990s, a number of central banks around the world began to survey the amount of derivative market activity and report the results to the Bank for International Settlements.|$|E
50|$|Genealogists must {{consider}} the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source {{is one that is}} not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>derivatives</b> include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.|$|E
