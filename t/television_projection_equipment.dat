50|$|Early color {{negative}} film had many shortcomings, including {{the high cost of}} the film, processing and printing, the mediocre color quality, rapid fading and discoloration of highlights of some types of print that became noticeable after several years. Amateurs who owned <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> used reversal films extensively because the cost of <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> and slide film was offset by not having to pay for prints. Eventually, print quality improved and prices decreased, and, by the 1970s, color {{negative film}} and color prints had largely displaced slides as the primary method of amateur photography.|$|R

5000|$|Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the Edison Manufacturing Company {{responded to}} this {{innovation}} with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations. [...] Concurrent formation of a black market for <b>projection</b> <b>equipment</b> exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909. [...] This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios. [...] Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties {{for use of the}} improvised <b>projection</b> <b>equipment.</b> To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and <b>projection</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
