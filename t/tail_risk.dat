40|$|Summary for non-specialistsThis study draws {{attention}} to the proliferation of <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> in financial markets prior to and {{during the course of the}} recent global financial crisis. It examines the level of <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> in selected equity, interbank lending and foreign exchange markets in selected EU Member States in relation to the United States. The extent of <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> is assessed by applying general error distribution (GED) parameterization in GARCH volatility tests of the examined variables. The empirical tests prove that <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> were pronounced across all of the examined European financial markets throughout the crisis. They were also significant prior to the crisis outbreak. The analyzed interbank lending markets exhibited more extreme volatility outbursts than the equity and foreign exchange markets. Several countercyclical monetary and macroprudential policies aimed at abating <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> are identified and discussed. Flexible capital adequacy and contingent capital requirements for financial institutions are advocated.

40|$|Abstract: With {{inflation}} and policy interest rates at historically low levels, policymakers show great concern about "downside <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> " {{due to a}} zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Low probability or tail events, such as sustained deflation or recession, are disruptive for the economy and {{can be difficult to}} resolve. This paper shows that price-level targeting mitigates downside <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> respect to inflation targeting when policy is conducted through a simple interest-rate rule subject to a zero lower bound. Thus, price-level targeting is a more effective policy framework than inflation targeting for the management of downside <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> in a low-inflation economy. At the same time, the average performance of the economy is not very different if policy implements price-level targeting instead of inflation targeting through a simple interest-rate rule. Price-level targeting may imply less variability of inflation than inflation targeting because policymakers can shape private-sector expectations about future inflation more effectively by targeting directly the price level path rather than inflation...|$|R

These <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> have vastly increased {{as a consequence}} of the recent global financial crisis. Additionally, this thesis introduces a nonparametric methodology for estimating and forecasting S&P 500 returns volatilities. An attractive feature of this method is that it does not make restrictive assumptions and data speaks for itself. In comparison to existing methods, our proposed method captures the underlying movements in the market volatilities and produces superior out-of-sample forecasts of global risk, particularly during the crises...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{portfolio}} diversification {{relies on the}} correlations among assets and among asset classes, but these correlations are not constant. Because correlations among assets and asset classes increase during <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> events and can go to 100%, TRP divides asset classes into buckets that behave differently under market stress conditions, while assets in each bucket behave similarly. During <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> events asset prices can fall significantly creating deep portfolio drawdowns. Asset classes in each <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> bucket fall simultaneously during <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> events and diversification of capital within buckets does not work because periods of negative performance of portfolio components are overlapped. Diversification across <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> buckets can provide benefits {{in the form of}} smaller portfolio drawdowns and reduce the need for <b>tail</b> <b>risk</b> protection.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{that even though}} the normal distribution is a good approximation to the na-ture of aggregate fluctuations, it severely underpredicts the frequency of large economic down-turns. We then provide a model that can explain these facts simultaneously. Our model shows that the propagation of microeconomic shocks through input-output linkages can fundamen-tally reshape the distribution of aggregate output, increasing the likelihood of large downturns (macroeconomic <b>tail</b> <b>risks)</b> from infinitesimal to substantial. For example, an economy subject to thin-tailed micro shocks but with “unbalanced ” input-output linkages (where some sectors or firms play a much more important role than others as inputs suppliers {{to the rest of the}} economy) may exhibit deep recessions as frequently as economies that are subject to heavy-tailed shocks. This is despite the fact that a central limit theorem-type result would imply that aggregate output is normally distributed. We characterize what types of input-output linkages and distributions of microeconomic shocks lead to sizable macroeconomic <b>tail</b> <b>risks,</b> and also show how the same economic forces cause the output of many sectors to simultaneously fall by large amounts...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how a {{fund manager}} takes skewed bets in two dimensions. First, the fund manager {{constantly}} reexamines fund performance relative {{to his or}} her peers and takes a position with respect to skewness risk. I show that when a fund manager underperforms peers, he or she will gamble on trades with lottery-like returns. On the other hand, when a fund outperforms peer funds, the fund manager will take negatively skewed trades to improve performance at the expense of significant downside risk. The results are robust to different econometric specifications. Second, I examine how convexity in incentives affects <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> across and within different types of investment funds. The literature has documented different forms of convexity that a fund manager faces: discounts in closed-end funds, tournaments and fund flow-performance relation in open-ended funds, and high-water mark provisions in hedge funds. Sorting funds by the degree of convexity and comparing skewness between the group with the most convexity and the group with the least convexity, I conclude that convexity affects fund <b>tail</b> <b>risks.</b> This result suggests that both implicit and explicit convexities provide incentives for fund managers to take bets with great downside risk...|$|R

In this model: outside investor wealth drives the demand for riskless debt and indirectly for securitization, bank assets and leverage move together, banks become interconnected through markets, and banks increase their exposure to systematic risk as they reduce idiosyncratic risk through diversification. The shadow banking system is stable and welfare improving under rational expectations, but vulnerable to crises and liquidity dry-ups when investors ignore <b>tail</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R

However, comparisons of <b>tail</b> <b>risks</b> based on different measures {{may not always be}} consistent.
