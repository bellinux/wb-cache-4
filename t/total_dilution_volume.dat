40|$|Snakebites in Italy are a rare {{source of}} severe medical condition, except {{in case of}} venomous snakes. The venom causes both local and/or {{systemic}} complication which may determine death in 6 - 60 hours, particularly in children and the elderly. In fact, {{the same amount of}} venom affects children more severely than adults because of the reduced <b>total</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> in children. The only specific and conflicting therapy for venomous snakebite is to administer the appropriate anti-venom; the remaining therapy is symptomatic and supportive. We describe the case of a 22 months old child who, despite appropriate symptomatic treatment, developed severe signs and an acute compartment syndrome of the right upper limb, a rare complication of venom snakebite. Administration of antivenom and fasciotomy were needed to resolve the acute episode permitting a positive outcome.

40|$|Snake bites are an {{important}} public health problem worldwide. Snake venom causes both systemic and local complications, which can prove fatal if not treated on time. The local effects of snake bite include tissue necrosis, edema, and compartment syndrome. Patients may also be left with permanent physical deformities due to residual sequelae of the snake bite. Compartment syndrome after a snake bite is an uncommon occurrence. The effects are more pronounced in children possibly due to the the reduced <b>total</b> <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> in children. The administration of anti-snake venom is the only specific therapy. Compartment syndrome occurs due to a vicious cycle of edema causing hypoxia and acidosis, which further increases capillary permeability and fluid extravasation. This results in a volume increase in the closed fascial compartment, which ultimately compromises circulation and causes irreversible muscle and nerve damage. Our report describes a case of upper limb compartment syndrome following a snake bite on the right wrist of a five-year-old girl who presented eight-hours after the snake bite to the emergency department of Nizwa Regional Referral Hospital. The patient received early and appropriate care but progressed to develop compartment syndrome for which {{she had to be}} taken to the operating theatre for emergency fasciotomy. All clinicians should be able to recognize the early symptoms and signs of an evolving compartment syndrome in absence of intracompartmental measuring equipment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide a basis for effectively protecting nonsmokers from acute sensory impacts and for preventing deterioration of indoor air quality caused by environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) emissions. With an olfactory experiment we determined odor detection thresholds (OT) of sidestream ETS (sETS), and with a full-body exposure experiment we investigated sensory symptoms at very low sETS exposure concentrations. OT concentrations for sETS are three and more orders of magnitude lower than ETS concentrations measured in field settings and correspond to a fresh air <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> of > 19, 000 m(3) per cigarette, over 100 times more than had previously been suggested for acceptable indoor air conditions.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{optimize}} different objectives (total analysis time, total peak capacity, and <b>total</b> <b>dilution)</b> {{has been applied}} to comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography. The approach is based on Pareto-optimality, and it yields optimal parameters (column particle sizes, column diameters, and modulation times). Losses in the peak capacities in the first dimension (due to undersampling) and in the second dimension (due to high injection volumes) have been taken into account. The first effect (detection band broadening) reduces the original peak capacity by about a half, the second effect can reduce the total peak capacity by an additional half. Thus, the total loss in peak capacity may be 75 % of its theoretical value. Analytical expressions to calculate these effects under gradient and isocratic conditions are derived. Of particular interest is the study of the optimal modulation times, which corresponded to between 2 and 3 two-dimensional runs per one-dimensional peak. The effects of using gradient or isocratic elution, conventional (40 MPa) or "ultra-high" (100 MPa) pressures, and focusing {{between the first and second}} dimensions were also studied.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{performance of}} spatial ("flat-bed") two-dimensional liquid chromatography (xLC × xLC) has been calculated using the Pareto-optimality strategy. This approach allowed different objectives (total peak capacity, total analysis time, and <b>total</b> <b>dilution)</b> {{to be considered}} simultaneously and to establish optimal parameters (pressure drop, particle size, bed length, and initial spot size). The performance of spatial two-dimensional chromatographic systems was {{compared with that of}} conventional on-line, real-time two-dimensional column-liquid-chromatography systems (tLC × tLC). The potential gain in peak capacity and/or analysis time of the spatial configuration was confirmed. By restricting the spatial parameters to realistic chromatographic conditions (limiting the stress, as counterbalance for the pressure drop through the sorbent bed, to 2500 kg) it was found that xLC × xLC is attractive for very fast analysis of complex samples, rather than for extremely efficient separations. For example, a peak capacity of 780 may be achieved in only 2. 7 min using a 100 × 100 mm sorbent bed of a quality currently encountered thin-layer chromatography. Furthermore, if beds can be packed as efficiently as contemporary columns, the predicted peak capacity increases to around 1000, corresponding to a peak-production rate of about 6. 3 peaks/s. Possibilities to boost the performance of xLC × xLC further are briefly discussed. Unless we can overcome the severe stress requirements of high-performance xLC × xLC, conventional tLC × tLC may be more amenable to very complex separations, thanks to the very high peak capacities. However, tLC × tLC separations will require long analysis times (e. g. 10, 000 peaks in 37 h, corresponding to 0. 075 peaks/s at a pressure drop of 40 MPa). The best trade-off between total peak capacity, total analysis time, and <b>total</b> <b>dilution</b> under restricted (realistic) conditions was obtained using high pressures, small chromatographic beds, small particles, and relatively large sample spots...|$|R

No significant effect of disturbance size (i. e. <b>dilution</b> <b>volume)</b> on clonal diversity was noted. However, frequency of disturbance had a pronounced effect on clonal diversity, with the highest clonal diversity maintained at low to intermediate disturbance frequencies. Competitive hierarchies among clones were often invariant within a given experiment. Generally, one or two clones dominated, with several less abundant clones persisting throughout an experiment. Results suggest that low to intermediate disturbances could be important in the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations (i. e. through pre-emption of competitive exclusion between genotypes).

40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} {{the state of}} knowledge about models which describe how radioactive substances from a geological repository can be transferred through ecosystems to flora, fauna and mankind. Radionuclide migration to the biosphere and to man primarily occurs via groundwater flows passing through the repository.

The groundwater is connected to various water systems such as wells, marshes and wetlands, lakes, water courses as well as coastal and sea waters. The groundwater can also contaminate cultivated land via groundwater transport to the cultivation zone and via irrigation.

40|$|Background:  It is {{generally}} agreed that diffusion of botulinum toxin occurs, but {{the extent of the}} spread and its clinical importance are disputed. Many factors have been suggested to play a role but which have the most clinical relevance is a subject of much discussion. Methods:  This review discusses the variables affecting diffusion, including protein composition and molecular size as well as injection factors (e. g., volume, dose, injection method). It also discusses data on diffusion from comparative studies in animal models and human clinical trials that illustrate differences between the available botulinum toxin products (onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and rimabotulinumtoxinB). Results:  Neither molecular weight nor the presence of complexing proteins appears to affect diffusion; however, injection volume, concentration, and dose all play roles and are modifiable. Both animal and human studies show that botulinum toxin products are not interchangeable, and that some products are associated with greater diffusion and higher rates of diffusion-related adverse events than others. Discussion:  Each of the botulinum toxins is a unique pharmacologic entity. A working knowledge of the different serotypes is essential to avoid unwanted diffusion-related adverse events. In addition, clinicians should be aware that the factors influencing diffusion may range from properties intrinsic to the drug to accurate muscle selection as well as <b>dilution,</b> <b>volume,</b> and dose injected. </div...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the ‘water footprint’ of worldwide cotton consumption, identifying both the location and the character of the impacts. The study distinguishes between three types of impact: evaporation of infiltrated rainwater for cotton growth (green water use), withdrawal of ground- or surface water for irrigation or processing (blue water use) and water pollution during growth or processing. The latter impact is quantified in terms of the <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> necessary to assimilate the pollution.

In all three towns the sewerage system is in a renewal phase and modem sewage treatment plants (biochemical treatment) are to be built. Since even the best treatment plants do not operate continuously, there should be a safe, complementary back-up system that would prevent sewage contamination of the littoral strip.

40|$|Background. The PNA (protein {{equivalent}} of nitrogen appearance) {{is used to}} calculate protein intake from urea kinetics. One of the essential assumptions in the calculation of PNA is that urea accumulation in haemodialysis (HD) patients is equivalent to amino acid oxidation. However, urea is hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting ammonia could be used metabolically. The magnitude and dependence on protein intake of this process are unknown in HD patients. Methods. Seven HD patients were studied twice, 1 week apart, on a similar protocol. After an overnight fast, patients fasted in the morning and received meals in the afternoon. On one day, amino acid oxidation was measured by infusion of L-[1 -C- 13]valine. Urea production, measured from the dilution of [C- 13]urea, and urea accumulation, calculated from the increase in plasma urea concentration multiplied by the urea <b>dilution</b> <b>volume,</b> were measured during the other day. PNA was calculated using standard equations. Results. Amino acid oxidation and urea production were not significantly different during fasting. Urea accumulation during fasting was significantly lower than both amino acid oxidation and urea production. Urea accumulation during feeding remained significantly lower than amino acid oxidation. PNA was equal to the average of the urea accumulation values during fasting and feeding. Conclusion. We conclude that during fasting, urea accumulation is not associated with amino acid oxidation or urea production. During meal intake, amino acid oxidation, urea production and urea accumulation show acutely an almost identical increase. PNA represents the average of fasting and fed urea accumulation and is lower than average amino acid oxidation or urea production...|$|R

Morphological changes were investigated by histological and electron microscopical means. Functional changes were investigated using histochemical and amino acid incorporation, techniques. The liver constituents were examined chemically. Plasma volume alterations were measured using dye and homologous protein dilution techniques. The histological appearance of the liver of treated animals included cellular swelling, dispersal of the cytoplasmic basophilia, and necrosis. Electron micrographs showed an early (3 hours following carbon tetrachloride administration) and widespread dislocation of the ribonucleoprotein particles from the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but no apparent alteration in the mitochondrial structure. Histochemical examination of two mitochondrial enzyme systems, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase, revealed no alterations in activities until a later time (6 to 12 hours following carbon tetrachloride administration). ATPase showed a gross quantitative decrease in activity at 6 and 12 hours, but not earlier. There was a decreased amino acid incorporation into two liver-produced proteins, viz., albumin and fibrinogen. This decrease is not explicable {{on the basis of}} the inability of the liver to take up the amino acid, an altered <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> into which the amino acid or formed protein is placed, or an impaired capacity of the liver to excrete protein once formed. It is concluded that the decreased amino acid incorporation rate reflects depressed synthesis of protein by the liver.

Recent work {{has shown that the}} indicator <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> (IDV) exceeds true diaiysate volume (TV) because the indicator or index solute is lost from the peritoneal cavity. A peritoneal transport model that includes significant solute loss from the peritoneal cavity is here described. Theory suggests that simultaneous measurements of both IDV and TV are required to calculate solute transport parameters for the peritoneal membrane when solutes are lost from the peritonea) cavity. The magnitude of systematic errors incurred by the use of either IDV or TV alone was determined in the calculated diffusive permeability-area product (PA) for creatinine during a two hour exchange in a rabbit model of peritoneal dialysis. IDV was measured using dextran (2 × 106 daltons) and TV by the dilution of multiple injections of Evans blue-albumin complex. Best estimates of PA using either or both volume measurements were determined in the blood to diaiysate direction with isotonic (N = 9) and hypertonic (N = 7) solutions and in the diaiysate to blood direction with isotonic (N = 4) and hypotonic (N = 4) solutions. Systematic errors in PA using either IDV alone or TV alone were small with either isotonic or hypertonic solutions but were increased with hypotonic solutions. Moreover, systematic errors were larger when using TV alone than IDV alone. When solute transport parameters for the peritoneal membrane are approximately determined employing only a single volume measurement, the use of IDV leads to less systematic error than TV...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Lymphatic {{mapping for}} {{prostate}} cancer {{can be used to}} determine therapeutic strategies. Sentinel node visualization requires sufficient nodal tracer uptake. We evaluated the effect of an increase in particle concentration on preoperative and intraoperative sentinel node depiction. METHODS: Enrolled in the study were 50 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. The first 25 patients (group A) received nanocolloid with standard labelling (0. 4 ml (99 m) Tc per 0. 1 mg nanocolloid). The last 25 patients (group B) received nanocolloid with a reduced labelling <b>dilution</b> <b>volume</b> (0. 4 ml (99 m) Tc per 0. 2 mg nanocolloid). The aimed injected volume and dosage were the same for both groups (225 MBq in 0. 4 ml). Intratumoral tracer injection was followed by planar lymphoscintigraphy (15 min and 2 h), SPECT/CT and laparoscopic sentinel lymphadenectomy. Lymph node visualization was evaluated using a four-point scoring system (0 nonvisualization to 3 intense visualization) and count quantification on the 2 -h anterior lymphoscintigram. In addition to the gamma ray detection probe, a portable gamma camera was used for intraoperative sentinel node visualization. RESULTS: Preoperative visualization in group A was 88 % (mean 2. 0 sentinel nodes per patient) versus 100 % in group B (mean 2. 6 sentinel nodes per patient). Visualization scores (p= 0. 008), total counts (p= 0. 001) and maximum counts per pixel (p= 0. 034) in the sentinel nodes were significantly better in group B. This also led to more efficient intraoperative detection of the sentinel nodes with the portable gamma camera (84 % in group A versus 100 % in group B). CONCLUSION: Enhancement of the particle concentration may lead to significant improvement in sentinel node visualization and intraoperative localization in patients with prostate cancer. Further research regarding optimization of radiotracer labelling by changing the particle concentration is warrante...|$|R
