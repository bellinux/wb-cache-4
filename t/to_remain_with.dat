5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>with</b> the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{intended}} {{to retire at}} the end of the 1969 season and sold his share in the team to Tauranac. However, Rindt's late decision <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>with</b> Lotus meant that Brabham drove for another year. He took his last win in the opening race of the 1970 season and was competitive throughout the year, although mechanical failures blunted his challenge. Aided by number-two driver Rolf Stommelen, the team came fourth in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well as a good shot. After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>with</b> the cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>with</b> him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{continually}} {{took the}} side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins, criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920. Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins. Babe Ruth resisted Huggins' discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight, and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth. The Yankees finished third in the AL in 1919 and 1920. Huggins signed a one-year contract <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>with</b> the team in 1921.|$|E

Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9million average annual value of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2million) and Manny Ramirez ($20million).|$|E

His mother was deeply concerned {{that he might be}} converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E
