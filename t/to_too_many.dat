5|$|With Kilmer's casting, Warner Bros. dropped Rene Russo as Chase Meridian. Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton {{were all}} being {{considered}} the role was recast with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams {{took on the}} role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.|$|E

But this term didn't persist.|$|E
25|$|There are differing {{views on}} how many schools a student should apply to. Several reports suggest that {{applying}} <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> schools caused unnecessary stress and expense, and hampers a student from targeting applications to a few select schools. But other advisors suggest that applying to more schools increases overall chances for acceptance. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest applying to eight to ten schools is best, and that applying <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> schools is counterproductive. There are reports that {{the average number of}} schools that students are applying to has been increasing, perhaps because of greater use of the Common Application. In 2008, applications to Harvard University had increased to a record number at 27,278, a 19% increase from the year before. One effect of these numerous applications is to lower the average yield of colleges, which dropped from 46% to 38% in 2001 according to one account.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas {{announced}} that they had signed a code-share agreement for their trans-Tasman routes and would file for authorisation from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The airlines maintained that they were making losses on Tasman routes due <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> empty seats, and that a codeshare would return the routes to profitability. Critics, particularly Wellington International Airport, Christchurch Airport and Melbourne Airport, argued that the codeshare would lead to reduced passenger choice and higher airfares, and that cities such as Auckland and Sydney would benefit immensely through economic activity services would bring.|$|E

25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more cash into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Boutwell {{had sought}} finance {{some of the}} debt {{reduction}} through the placement of loans in Europe. [...] This idea was complicated by Civil War claims against the United Kingdom (the so-called Alabama Claims emanating from British support for the CSS Alabama and other Confederate privateers), {{and then by the}} outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War shortly after the financing bill was passed. [...] The latter prevented placement of offers in mainland European financial centers, and the unresolved Alabama issues prevented their placement in London. [...] Political pressure {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic resulted in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, after which Boutwell floated a loan in London. [...] The first loan offer unravelled, however, because Boutwell offered it <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> banks, but a second, reorganized attempt led by financier Jay Cooke succeeded in raising over $100 million. [...] It was the first time an American bank successfully engaged in this type of international transaction.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{introduction}} of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994. The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, the [...] "juiced balls" [...] theory claiming that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, [...] "watered down pitching" [...] implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due <b>to</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> teams. Albeit that these factors did play {{a large role in}} increasing home run thus scoring totals during this time, others that directly impact ballplayers have an equally important role. As noted earlier one of those factors is anabolic steroids which have the capability of increasing muscle mass, which enables hitters to not only hit [...] "mistake" [...] pitches farther, but it also enables hitters to adjust to [...] "good" [...] pitches such as a well-placed fastball, slider, changeup, or curveball, and hit them for home runs. Another such factor is better nutrition, as well as training and training facilities/equipment which can work with (or without) steroids to produce a more potent ballplayer and further enhance his skills.|$|E
