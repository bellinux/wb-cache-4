5000|$|The Olympus PEN E-P5 is a micro four thirds {{camera and}} - despite its number - the fourth {{model in the}} PEN E-P range. It {{includes}} the same 16 MP sensor as the Olympus OM-D E-M5, an improved 5-axis in-body image stabilization, 9 frames per second continuous shooting, and a tilting rear touch screen. Compared to its predecessor E-P3 it has enhanced in-camera raw conversion, a HDR bracketing mode, {{and the ability to}} specify whether to use in-lens or in-body image stabilization with Panasonic lenses. Fastest shutter speed is 1/8000 sec, it has focus peaking to assist manual focus, and built in Wi-Fi for connection to smartphone or tablet. The controls have been changed compared to E-P3: instead of a <b>thumb</b> <b>roller</b> and rear dials it has two horizontal top-plate dials for exposure adjustments. The function of these can be changed by a lever {{on the back of the}} camera and are customizable. The E-P5 comes in three colour schemes; black, silver and white.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} measure of roller chain's {{strength}} is tensile strength. Tensile strength represents how much load a chain can withstand under a one-time load before breaking. Just {{as important as}} tensile strength is a chain's fatigue strength. The critical factors in a chain's fatigue strength {{is the quality of}} steel used to manufacture the chain, the heat treatment of the chain components, the quality of the pitch hole fabrication of the linkplates, and the type of shot plus the intensity of shot peen coverage on the linkplates. Other factors can include the thickness of the linkplates and the design (contour) of the linkplates. The rule of <b>thumb</b> for <b>roller</b> chain operating on a continuous drive is for the chain load to not exceed a mere 1/6 or 1/9 of the chain's tensile strength, {{depending on the type of}} master links used (press-fit vs. slip-fit). Roller chains operating on a continuous drive beyond these thresholds can and typically do fail prematurely via linkplate fatigue failure.|$|R
