25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} {{intended for}} All My Children to begin its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All My Children. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that All My Children along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported <b>that</b> <b>Prospect</b> Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All My Children and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park {{not being able to}} sign enough cast members from All My Children.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC canceled All My Children after 41 years on the air due to low ratings. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of All My Children to third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of webisodes. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. On September 26, 2011, the following Monday, ABC replaced All My Children with a newly debuted talk show The Chew. Prospect Park had suspended its plan to revive the series on November 23, 2011, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews. On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore All My Children as a web series. The show taped its first scenes for Prospect Park TOLN on February 18, 2013, and its first episode on the network aired on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run. On November 11, 2013, several All My Children cast members announced <b>that</b> <b>Prospect</b> Park had closed production and canceled the series again. ABC regained the rights to All My Children in December 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. According to review aggregator website Metacritic, the album received an average critic score of 72 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, [...] "They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album -- it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head -- that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album [...] "A-" [...] {{and called it}} their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review explaining [...] "Viva la Vidas mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to {{think outside the box}} when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that [...] "Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off." [...] Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that [...] "the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, [...] "For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes -- think love, war and peace -- is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of [...] "Death and All His Friends"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make <b>that</b> <b>prospect</b> seem".

40|$|Very {{high energy}} γ-ray {{observations}} of distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) generally result in higher fluxes and harder spectra than expected, resulting in some tension {{with the level}} of the extragalactic background light (EBL). If hypothetical axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) were to exist, this tension could be relieved since the oscillation of photons to ALPs would mitigate the effects of EBL absorption and lead to softer inferred intrinsic AGN spectra. In this paper we consider the effect of photon-ALP mixing on observed spectra, including the photon-ALP mixing that would occur within AGN jets. We then simulate observations of three AGN with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a next generation γ-ray telescope, to determine its prospects for detecting the signatures of photon-ALP mixing on the spectra. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>prospects</b> for CTA detecting these signatures or else setting limits on the ALP parameter space are quite promising. We find <b>that</b> <b>prospects</b> are improved if photon-ALP mixing within the jet is properly considered and that the best target for observations is PKS 2155 - 304...|$|R
