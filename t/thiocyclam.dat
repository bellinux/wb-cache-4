40|$|AbstractIn this study, a nereistoxin {{analogue}} insecticide, <b>thiocyclam,</b> {{was administered}} to adult male albino rats by gavage dose of 135, 270 and 540 mg/kg b. w. repeated for 5 days at 24 h intervals. Control animals received only water. <b>Thiocyclam</b> was tested for its potential to cause genotoxic effects in rat bone marrow cells using an in vivo micronucleus assay. After 24 h of the last treatment, rats from all dose levels were sacrificed. Bone marrow cells were collected and assayed {{for the presence of}} micronuclei. <b>Thiocyclam</b> did not cause any increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in rats bone marrow at any of the dose levels. The polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE:NCE) ratio was found to be in the range from 0. 50 ± 0. 11 to 0. 55 ± 0. 02. The results of this study demonstrate that the effect of <b>thiocyclam</b> is not significant in the rat in vivo micronucleus assay...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThiocyclam (trade name Evisect) is a broad-spectrum nereistoxin {{analogue}} insecticide used widely {{for agricultural}} applications. The {{aim of this}} investigation was to determine its genotoxic effects in the chromosome aberration (CA) test and determining of mitotic index (MI), using lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples of healthy human donors. A negative and a positive control (MMC) were also included. Chromosomal analyses of the metaphase plates of the samples treated with 14 different concentrations (from 0. 1 to 120 μg/ml) of <b>thiocyclam,</b> indicating the lack effect on chromosomes. Thus <b>thiocyclam</b> is not genotoxic but highly toxic on cell proliferation in human lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} insecticides were compared on survival {{and development of}} the leafminer, L. trifolii, in celery in Michigan and parasitism was assessed in this non- resident population. Avermectin, <b>thiocyclam,</b> and cyromazine effectively controlled L. trifolii larvae or prevented successful emergence as adults. Moderate to high levels of resistance to permethrin and chlorpyrifos were present. Avermectin caused high mortality of all larval stages and no adults successfully emerged. <b>Thiocyclam</b> caused high mortality to all larval stages, but did not affect adult emergence from the surviving larvae. Cyromazine acted most strongly against early stage larvae before visible mines were present, caused little direct mortality of larger larvae, but prevented successful adult emergence. No parasitoids emerged from 2029 larvae collected and reared, in contrast to studies in sites where L. trifolii is a year-round resident...|$|E
40|$|Rodents {{are widely}} {{used to test the}} {{developmental}} neurotoxicity potential of chemical substances. The regulatory test procedures are elaborate and the requirement of numerous animals is ethically disputable. Therefore, non-animal alternatives are highly desirable, but appropriate test systems that meet regulatory demands are not yet available. Hence, we have developed a new developmental neurotoxicity assay based on specific whole-mount immunostainings of primary and secondary motor neurons (using the monoclonal antibodies znp 1 and zn 8) in zebrafish embryos. By classifying the motor neuron defects, we evaluated the severity of the neurotoxic damage to individual primary and secondary motor neurons caused by chemical exposure and determined the corresponding effect concentration values (EC 50). In a proof-of-principle study, we investigated the effects of three model compounds <b>thiocyclam,</b> cartap and disulfiram, which show some neurotoxicity-indicating effects in vertebrates, and the positive controls ethanol and nicotine and the negative controls 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) and triclosan. As a quantitative measure of the neurotoxic potential of the test compounds, we calculated the ratios of the EC 50 values for motor neuron defects and the cumulative malformations, as determined in a zebrafish embryo toxicity test (zFET). Based on this index, disulfiram was classified as the most potent and <b>thiocyclam</b> as the least potent developmental neurotoxin. The index also confirmed the control compounds as positive and negative neurotoxicants. Our findings demonstrate that this index can be used to reliably distinguish between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic chemicals and provide a sound estimate for the neurodevelopmental hazard potential of a chemical. The demonstrated method can be a feasible approach {{to reduce the number of}} animals used in developmental neurotoxicity evaluation procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of 14 substances, including {{a number of}} pesticides, to the eggs of the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum was determined in laboratory experiments. Eggs were kept in contact with a precisely defined artificial soil to which a range of concentrations of the test substances had been applied. Mortality of the eggs was assessed every 24 h and the median lethal doses (LD 50) were determined. The herbicides bromoxynil, ioxynil and pyridate + bromoxynil, the insecticides <b>thiocyclam,</b> diflubenzuron and azadirachtin, the molluscicides metaldehyde and methiocarb, and other compounds such as carvone, iron-EDDHA, saponin, and an extract of Pongamia pinnata, killed the eggs after periods of exposure ranging from 2 to 14 days, depending on the compound and the dose. Only two compounds, the insecticides imidacloprid and teflubenzuron, failed to kill the eggs of D. reticulatum {{at any of the}} doses tested. Values of LD 50 below 0. 01 mg a. i. cm- 2 were obtained for the herbicides bromoxynil, ioxynil and pyridate + bromoxynil, and for the biological pesticide azadirachtin. The feasibility of slug egg control in different contexts is discusse...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} simple, rapid, and {{effective}} method for simultaneous detection of cartap (Ca), <b>thiocyclam</b> (Th), and tebufenozide (Te) in Chinese herbal medicines including Radix Angelicae Dahuricae and Liquorices using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR). The proposed method {{can handle the}} intrinsic interferences of herbal samples; satisfactory average recoveries attained from near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) PLSR models were 99. 0 ± 10. 8 and 100. 2 ± 1. 0 % for Ca, 100. 2 ± 6. 9 and 99. 7 ± 2. 5 % for Th, and 99. 1 ± 6. 3 and 99. 6 ± 1. 0 % for Te, respectively. Furthermore, some statistical parameters and figures of merit are fully investigated to evaluate {{the performance of the}} two models. It was found that both models could give accurate results and only the performance of MIR-PLSR was slightly better than that of NIR-PLSR in the cases suffering from herbal matrix interferences. In conclusion, FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with PLSR has been demonstrated for its application in rapid screening and quantitative analysis of multipesticide residues in Chinese herbal medicines without physical or chemical separation pretreatment step and any spectral processing, which also implies other potential applications such as food and drug safety, herbal plants quality, and environmental evaluation, due to its advantages of nontoxic and nondestructive analysis...|$|E
