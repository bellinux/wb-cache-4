5|$|<b>The</b> <b>treacherous</b> {{conditions}} for ships {{around the island}} led to several shipwrecks. The British passenger vessel Tapley lost seven passengers when it became stranded on Flat Holm in January 1773 on its passage from Cork, Ireland to Bristol.|$|E
5000|$|During World War I, Strange, {{who was a}} {{supporter}} of Prohibition, gave a speech denouncing Wisconsin's German brewers and linking them to the USA's wartime enemies, saying, [...] "...the worst of all our German enemies, <b>the</b> most <b>treacherous,</b> <b>the</b> most menacing, are Pabst, Schlitz, Blatz and Miller." ...|$|R

5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> {{conditions}} in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal supplement to the islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Devagiri, Shiva comes {{to know of}} <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> wars that the Chandravanshis are {{carrying}} on the Meluhans. He also meets Brahaspati, the Chief Inventor of the Meluhans. Brahaspati invites Shiva and the royal family on an expedition to Mount Mandar, where the legendary Somras is manufactured using {{the waters of the}} Saraswati river. Shiva learns that the potion which made his throat turn blue was actually undiluted Somras, which can be lethal when taken in its pure form. However, Shiva was unaffected, which was the first sign that he was the Neelkanth. He also learns that Somras was the reason why the Meluhans lived for so many years. Brahaspati and Shiva develop a close friendship and the royal family returns to Devagiri. One morning, the whole of Meluha wakes up to loud noises coming from Mount Mandar. Shiva and his troops reach the hill to find out that a large part of Mandar has been blasted off and many of the inventors killed. There is no sign of Brahaspati, but Shiva finds the insignia of the Nagas, confirming their involvement in <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> wars of the Chandravanshis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|On {{level ground}} again, {{they began to}} make quick progress. They awoke {{on the morning of}} 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the Ninnis Glacier) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> descent. Once {{at the bottom of the}} glacier they spent four days {{crossing}} fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge {{what he saw as}} <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> killing of his warriors under a flag of truce. After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the fictional}} world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the {{destruction}} of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion Sam (Sean Astin) and <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E

5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two and half years they fought {{in a number of}} major battles in the {{trenches}} along the Western Front including Polygon Wood, Amiens and the St Quentin Canal, as well as playing a supporting role in a number of others including Bullecourt and Morlancourt. During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched on 8 August 1918, the battalion took part in the 8th Brigade's advance up <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> Morcourt Valley, subsequently achieving a considerable feat by capturing the town of Vauvillers. The battalion fought its last battle of the war in late September alongside the US 30th Infantry Division, when they breached the German defences along the Hindenburg Line as part of the final Allied offensive of the war. Aimed at the Le Catelet Line near Bellicourt, the battalion began its advance on Nauroy on 29 September, moving on the left flank beside elements of the US 117th Infantry Regiment, with the 32nd Battalion in support. The attack proved highly successful and 59 prisoners were captured along with four field guns and a quantity of German small arms. Against this the battalion lost 17 men killed and 63 wounded.|$|E
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E

50|$|Capt. William Gill was {{renowned for}} his seamanship, and is of {{particular}} note, as {{he was the first}} person to chart a safe, navigable channel through <b>the</b> (then) <b>treacherous</b> River Mersey. This navigable route became known as the Victoria Channel.|$|R
5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the grounding. Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> Columbia River bar for an additional two days. Salvage Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the grounding occurred.|$|E
5|$|Serbian epic poetry {{agrees that}} King Vukašin was Marko's father. His {{mother in the}} poems was Jevrosima, sister of voivode Momčilo, {{the lord of the}} Pirlitor Fortress (on Mount Durmitor in Old Herzegovina). Momčilo is {{described}} as a man of immense size and strength with magical attributes: a winged horse and a sabre with eyes. Vukašin murdered him {{with the help of the}} voivode's young wife, Vidosava, despite Jevrosima's self-sacrificing attempt to save her brother. Instead of marrying Vidosava (the original plan), Vukašin killed <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> woman. He took Jevrosima from Pirlitor to his capital city, Skadar, and married her according to the advice of the dying Momčilo. She bore him two sons, Marko and Andrijaš, and the poem recounting these events says that Marko took after his uncle Momčilo. This epic character corresponds historically with Bulgarian brigand and mercenary Momchil, who was in the service of Serbian Tsar Dušan; he later became a despot and died in the 1345 Battle of Peritheorion. According to another account, Marko and Andrijaš were mothered by a vila (Slavic mountain nymph) married by Vukašin after he caught her near a lake and removed her wings so she could not escape.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{civilian}} {{populations in}} the occupied areas were severely persecuted and endured <b>the</b> <b>treacherous</b> conditions of the Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad (when more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost {{about a quarter of}} its population. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet civilian deaths {{at the hands of the}} Nazis and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated. In 1995 the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that civilian deaths in the occupied USSR, including Jews, at the hands of the Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians, including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission.|$|E
