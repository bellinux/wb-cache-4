5|$|At Rome {{indeed the}} works of art are legion; besides, one effaces another from the memory and, however {{beautiful}} they may be, we are distracted by the overpowering claims of duty and business; for <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> art we need leisure and profound stillness (XXXVI:26–72).|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{visited the}} British Mandate of Palestine in 1948 and wrote dispatches {{at the time}} for the Boston Post about his trip and the effect it had on him when he was twenty-two years old. During his stay, he wrote that he grew <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> the Jewish {{inhabitants}} of the area. As a Senator, he later became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels {{spoke at}} party {{meetings}} in Munich {{and at the}} annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels {{was involved in the}} planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> and idolize him even more.|$|E

5|$|Custine {{began his}} career {{at the age of}} eight, in 1748, {{at the end of the}} War of Austrian Succession in Germany under Marshal Saxe, who {{continued}} his tutelage during peace time. During the Seven Years' War (175663), Custine served in the French army in the German states; in 1758, he was a captain of dragoons in the Schomberg regiment. While fighting the Prussians, Custine learned <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> their modern military organization, which later influenced his own military style.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus' {{last years}} were troubled by illness. He had {{suffered}} from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks {{to the care of}} Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was born}} in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near {{the banks of the}} Hocking River. His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a {{successful}} lawyer who sat on the Ohio Supreme Court, died unexpectedly in 1829. He left his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, Sr., a prominent member of the Whig Party who served as senator from Ohio and as the first Secretary of the Interior. Sherman was distantly related to American founding father Roger Sherman and grew <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Implicit {{preferences}} for Whites compared to Blacks {{can be reduced}} via exposure <b>to</b> <b>admired</b> Black and disliked White individuals (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001). In four studies (total N = 4, 628), while attempting to clarify the mechanism, we found that implicit {{preferences for}} Whites were weaker in the “positive Blacks ” exposure condition compared to a control condition (weighted average d =. 08). This effect was substantially smaller than the original demonstration (Dasgupta & Greenwald, 2001; d =. 82). Factors beyond exposure <b>to</b> <b>admired</b> Blacks may be necessary for the effect, such as making race accessible during exemplar exposure and including negative White exemplars. Our evidence suggests that exposure to known-group members shifts implicit race bias reliably, but weakly...|$|R

As the days go by, Siddhu grows <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> the ever-friendly Hasini as someone who does what she loves, and he discovers many small things which make him happy {{to be in her}} company; he realizes that he has fallen in love with her.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Evan soon {{learns that}} 614 {{actually}} {{refers to the}} verse in the Book of Genesis, where God instructs Noah to build an Ark {{in preparation for a}} flood. God later repeatedly appears in various guises before finally revealing himself to Evan, and cordially insisting that he should also build an ark as well. God explains to Evan that a flood is coming, and that the only opportunity Evan will have to change the world is by saving his community instead. God also tells Evan to inform others about the flood should they ask him later. Concerned about Evan's behavior, Joan initially believes that he is having a mid-life crisis. Evan begins constructing the ark with his sons, who start <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> him as he is spending more time with them.|$|E

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{increasingly}} {{became a}} significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the Republican National Committee. In 1884, {{he was elected}} a delegate to that year's Republican convention, where he served {{as chair of the}} Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio. Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing, while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, {{as well as those of}} Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention, where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, Maine Senator James G. Blaine. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker. Hanna came <b>to</b> <b>admire</b> McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.|$|E
