25|$|The {{desk pad}} (Chinese T: 畫氈, S: 画毡, Pinyin: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 shitajiki) is a pad made of felt. Some are printed with grids on both sides, {{so that when}} it is placed under the <b>translucent</b> <b>paper,</b> {{it can be used}} as a guide to ensure correct {{placement}} and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using fluorine-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to the parchment. A silicone-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. Chromium salts {{can also be used to}} impart moderate anti-stick properties.|$|E
25|$|By {{winter the}} roof was in place, clad in {{reflective}} aluminum {{to make it look}} more like ice blocks. Larocque set himself to the church's decorative touches. To create the appearance of stained glass in the windows, an old French technique was used. The pattern was drawn and painted on <b>translucent</b> <b>paper,</b> then sandwiched between glass. Larocque created the alcove behind the altar and its crucifix himself. Adam commissioned Mona Sharer, a 17-year-old deaf-mute Inuit woman who had shown talent as an artist at a Catholic school in Aklavik, to paint the Stations of the Cross on the inside walls. She started in January 1960 and completed the work in two months, along with some other paintings of scenes from the life of Christ. Later that year the church was formally consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by Paul Piché, bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Mackenzie (later elevated to the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith).|$|E

2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would {{try to make it}} positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of an}} enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|The Huygens {{contrived}} some ingenious {{arrangements for}} aiming these [...] "aerial telescopes" [...] at an object {{visible in the}} night sky. The telescope could be aimed at bright objects such as planets by looking for their image cast on a white pasteboard ring or oiled <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> screen and then centering them in the eyepiece. Fainter objects could be found by looking for the reflection of a lamp held in the observer's hand being bounced back by the objective and then centering that reflection on the object. Other contrivances for the same purpose are described by Philippe de la Hire and by Nicolaas Hartsoeker. The objectives for aerial telescopes sometimes had very long focal lengths. Christiaan Huygens states that in 1686 {{he and his brother}} made objectives of 8inch (200mm) and 8.5inch (220mm) diameter and 170 and 210ft (52 and 64m) focal length, respectively. Constantijn Huygens, Jr. presented a 7.5inch (190mm) diameter 123ft (37.5m) focal length objective to the Royal Society of London in 1690. Adrien Auzout and others made telescopes of from 300 to 600ft (90 to 180m) focal length, and Auzout proposed a huge aerial telescope 1,000ft in length that he would use [...] "to observe animals on the Moon".|$|E

60|$|It was a Chinaman {{sitting with}} two {{others in a}} little low room {{separated}} by <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> windows from a noisy street of shrill-voiced people. The three had been talking of the ultimatum that Japan had sent that day to China, claiming a priority in many matters over European influences they {{were by no means}} sure whether it was a wrong or a benefit that had been done to their country. From that topic they had passed to the discussion of the war, and then of wars and national aggressions and the perpetual thrusting and quarrelling of mankind. The older man had said that so life would always be; it was the will of Heaven. The little, very yellow-faced, emaciated man had agreed with him. But now this younger man, to whose thoughts the Angel had so particularly directed the bishop's attention, was speaking. He did not agree with his companion.|$|E

50|$|Tracing {{paper is}} named as such {{for its ability}} for an image to be traced onto it. When tracing paper is placed onto a picture, the picture is easily {{viewable}} through the tracing paper. Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the tracing paper. Pure cellulose fiber is translucent, {{and it is the}} air trapped between fibers, that makes paper opaque and looks white. If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting sheet will be <b>translucent.</b> <b>Translucent</b> <b>papers</b> are dense and contain up to 10% moisture at 50% humidity. This type of paper is roughly 25% lighter than regular paper.|$|R
5000|$|Protective device {{coordination}} is {{the process}} of determining the [...] "best fit" [...] timing of current interruption when abnormal electrical conditions occur. The goal is to minimize an outage to the greatest extent possible. Historically, protective device coordination was done on <b>translucent</b> log-log <b>paper.</b> Modern methods normally include detailed computer based analysis and reporting.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} Japanese architecture, a shōji (lead=yes) is a door, {{window or}} room divider consisting of <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> over {{a frame of}} wood which holds together a lattice of wood or bamboo. While washi is the traditional paper, shōji may be made of paper made by modern manufacturing processes; plastic is also in use.|$|E
5000|$|Both fusuma and shōji (sheer, <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> room dividers) run {{on wooden}} rails {{at the top}} and bottom. The upper rail is called a kamoi (lit. [...] "duck's place"), and the lower is called a shikii (...) [...] Traditionally these were waxed, but {{nowadays}} they usually have a vinyl lubricating strip to ease movement of the fusuma and shōji.|$|E

5000|$|Onionskin or {{onion skin}} is a thin, light-weight, strong, often <b>translucent</b> <b>paper.</b> Though not made from onions, it superficially resembles their thin, papery skins. It was usually used with carbon paper for typing duplicates in a typewriter, for {{permanent}} records where low bulk was important, or for airmail correspondence. [...] It is typically 25-39 g/m² (9-pound basis weight in US units), {{and may be}} white or canary-colored.|$|E
50|$|The {{transparency}} {{of the paper}} is achieved by careful selection of the raw materials and the process used to create transparency. Cellulose fibre forms {{the basis of the}} paper, usually from wood species but also from cotton fibre. Often, paper contains other filler materials to enhance opacity and print quality. For tracing or <b>translucent</b> <b>paper</b> it is necessary to remove any material which obstructs the transmission of light.|$|E

5000|$|McCay {{made the}} [...] {{drawings}} on <b>translucent</b> rice <b>paper.</b> The film {{came before the}} development of cel animation, in which animators draw on clear sheets of celluloid and lay them over static backgrounds. Thus, on each drawing McCay had to redraw the background, which appears to waver slightly due {{to the difficulty of}} reproducing it perfectly each time. McCay re-used some of the drawings to loop repeated actions, a technique he used once in Little Nemo and more extensively in his later films.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of drawing, including figure drawing, cartooning, doodling, free hand and shading. There are also many drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the surrealist method of entopic graphomania (in which dots are {{made at the}} sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a <b>translucent</b> <b>paper,</b> such as tracing paper, around the outline of preexisting shapes that show through the paper).|$|E

50|$|The process {{starts with}} {{original}} documents {{that have been}} created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, vellums, linens, and <b>translucent</b> bond <b>papers</b> (bonds). Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, {{the intensity of the}} UV exposure light is adjusted using an intensity knob typically pre-marked for media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.|$|R
