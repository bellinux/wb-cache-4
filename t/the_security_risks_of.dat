[...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have tamper-evident features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- <b>The</b> <b>security</b> of {{information}} systems {{has been the focus}} because of network applications. Vulnerability analysis is widely used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of a system to assure system <b>security.</b> With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> vulnerability analysis, <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a system can be predicted so that the countermeasures are arranged in advance. These will promote system <b>security</b> effectively. <b>The</b> object of vulnerability analysis is to find out <b>the</b> unknown <b>security</b> holes in a system. It could be helpful to understand <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>security</b> holes and to assess <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a system. Data-flow based analysis shows its predominance in vulnerability analysis because the vulnerability is data-flow dependent. The paper discusses how to use data-flow analysis in vulnerability analysis. The way to apply data-flow analysis in Java bytecode vulnerability analyzing is presented.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> using a smart DNS {{proxy server}} {{are very similar}} to that of using any other proxy server, as a {{compromised}} or malicious proxy has the ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on any unprotected traffic passed through it. Since the user is not aware which parts of his traffic are redirected and intercepted by the Smart DNS proxy, this risk extends to all sites the user accesses, not just those the smart DNS proxy is configured to intercept. For this reason it is quite common to install a second router in the house specifically for media streaming.|$|E

In this paper, we apply a method for measuring attack surfaces to enterprise software written in Java.

We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by measuring the attack surfaces of three versions of an SAP software system. We envision our measurement method and tool to be useful to software developers for improving software security and quality. ...|$|R
