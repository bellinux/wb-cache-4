25|$|When Fleury died in January 1743 {{at the age}} of 90, Louis XV {{took control}} of government.

Butler was provided lists of supporters, including one claiming 190 of the 236 members of the powerful <b>trade</b> <b>body</b> the Corporation of London as 'Jacobite.' When Louis asked why the English needed help if support was so widespread, his advisors attributed it to dislike of foreigners and government repression.
