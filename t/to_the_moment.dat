5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment is proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> that Florida passed its ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|Following the event, Gunn reverts Illyria to her demonic form, after which, Illyria {{decides to}} wholly {{collapse}} time and all existence. In {{an attempt to}} prevent Angel and his team from stopping Illyria, Gunn mortally wounds Connor.

Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E
5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E
