40|$|Here we {{investigate}} the thermodynamic states occurring in explosion fields from the detonation of condensed explosives in air. In typical applications, {{the pressure of}} expanded detonation products gases is modeled by a Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) function: P{sub JWL} = f(v,s{sub CJ}); constants in that function are fit to cylinder test data. This function provides a specification of pressure {{as a function of}} specific volume, v, along the expansion isentrope (s = constant = s{sub CJ}) starting at the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state. However, the JWL function is not a fundamental equation of thermodynamics, and therefore gives an incomplete specification of states. For example, explosions inherently involve shock reflections from surfaces; this changes the entropy of the products, and in such situations the JWL function provides no information on the products states. In addition, most explosives are not oxygen balanced, so if hot detonation products mix with air, they after-burn, releasing the heat of reaction via a turbulent combustion process. This raises the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosion</b> products cloud to the adiabatic flame temperature ({approx} 3, 000 K). Again, the JWL function provides no information on the combustion products states...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Properties {{that cause}} {{explosion}} hazard of organic peroxides, hydroperoxides and nitrocompounds are {{examined in the}} article. Ability to thermal explosion initiation of benzoyl peroxide and of nitrocompounds is compared. Explosion properties of peroxides are analyzed. Measurements of burning temperature by means of micro thermocouples and the comparison of their values with the calculated ones of benzoyl peroxide and hydroperoxide of isopropyl benzene lead {{to the conclusion that}} burning of them propagates in condensed phase. It is noted that heat instability of benzoyl peroxide burning, contrary to many nitrocompounds, is absent. Burning of benzoyl peroxide is stable even in vacuum. It is noted that, although benzoyl peroxide is not applied as explosive, in some cases the explosion hazard of benzoyl peroxide heating can be bigger than that of PETN. This conclusion was {{made on the basis of}} an investigation carried out by means of DSC method. The explosion process of benzoyl peroxide and hydroperoxide of isopropyl benzene propagates in a regime reminiscent of a low velocity detonation and the explosive effects are sufficient for severe destructions during accidents. This conclusion unfortunately is confirmed by bitter experience in practice. The results of the investigation of condensed products of explosion at impact of mixtures aluminum with peroxides and with nitrocompounds by means of impact-testing machine that were carried out in this work by X-ray diffraction analysis are discussed.

40|$|Introduction: Shock-dispersed fuel (SDF) {{explosives}} {{use a small}} chemical {{charge to}} disperse a combustible fuel that burns in the post-detonation environment. The energy released in the combustion process {{has the potential for}} generating higher pressures and temperatures than conventional explosives. However, the development of these types of novel explosive systems requires a detailed understanding of all of the modes of energy release. Objective: The objective of this project is develop a simulation capability for predicting explosion and combustion phase of SDF charges and apply that capability to quantifying the behavior of these types of explosives. Methodology: We approximate the dynamics of an SDF charge using high Reynolds number, fast chemistry model that effectively captures the thermodynamic behavior of SDF charges and accurately models the key modes of energy release. The overall computational model is combined with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), implemented in a parallel adaptive framework suited to the massively parallel computer systems. Results: We have developed a multiphase version of the model and used it to simulate an SDF charge in which the dispersed fuel is aluminum flakes. Flow visualizations show that the combustion field is turbulent for the chamber and tunnel cases studied. During the 3 milli-seconds of simulation, over 90 % of the Al fuel was consumed for the chamber case, while about 40 % was consumed in the tunnel case in agreement with Al-SDF experiments. Significance to DoD: DoD has a requirement to develop enhanced energetic materials to support future military systems. The SDF charges described here utilize the combustion mechanism to increase energy per gram of fuel by a factor of 7 to 10 over conventional (detonating) charges, and increase the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> cloud to 2, 000 - 4, 000 K (depending on the SDF fuel).

5000|$|A phreatic {{eruption}}, {{also called}} a phreatic explosion, ultravulcanian eruption or steam-blast eruption, occurs when magma heats ground or surface water. The extreme <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the magma (anywhere from 500 to 1170 C) causes near-instantaneous evaporation to steam, {{resulting in an}} <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> steam, water, ash, rock, and volcanic bombs. At Mount St. Helens, hundreds <b>of</b> steam <b>explosions</b> preceded a 1980 plinian eruption of the volcano. A less intense geothermal event {{may result in a}} mud volcano.|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of powerful computers these days increasingly enables {{the use of}} CFD for the numerical simulation <b>of</b> <b>explosion</b> phenomena. The BLAST software consists of a compilation of codes for the numerical simulation of the gas dynamics <b>of</b> <b>explosions.</b> Each individual code has been tailored to a specific application. After a brief introduction to the basic structure of the software, its potentials have been demonstrated in an exposition of applications to a variety <b>of</b> <b>explosion</b> problems...|$|R

It is shown that {{in the presence of}} Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 and MnO 2 oxidation stability of nanopowders raised, which was testified by the values <b>of</b> oxidation parameters: <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> oxidation start, oxidation degree and maximum velosity of metal oxidation. Oxidation processes taking place in nanopowders slowed down with increase of oxidation additive content...|$|R

500|$|At 9:04:35am, the out-of-control fire {{on board}} Mont-Blanc finally set off her highly {{explosive}} cargo. The ship was completely blown apart {{and a powerful}} blast wave radiated away from the explosion at more than [...] per second. <b>Temperatures</b> <b>of</b> [...] and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at the centre <b>of</b> the <b>explosion.</b> White-hot shards <b>of</b> iron fell down upon Halifax and Dartmouth. Mont-Blancs forward 90mm gun, its barrel melted away, landed approximately [...] north <b>of</b> the <b>explosion</b> site near Albro Lake in Dartmouth, while the shank of her anchor, weighing half a ton, landed [...] south at Armdale.|$|R
