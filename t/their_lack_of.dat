5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. This is due to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E
5|$|On March 30, 1904, the ARF {{played a}} major role in the Sasun Uprising. The ARF sent arms and fedayi to defend the region for the second time.

Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.|$|E

5|$|The farm {{seizures}} {{were often}} violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, {{with many of}} their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> access to fertiliser.|$|E

There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
5|$|A Team D.A.D.D.Y. {{directed}} {{music video}} {{was made to}} accompany the track's release as a single.

50|$|The eastern Spadefoot {{entered the}} {{endangered}} list of Pennsylvania in 2005 (though also endangered in: Ohio, Connecticut, and Rhode Island), when living populations were only found {{in two of}} their known locations. Which is odd because the American Spadefoot tadpole has the highest metamorphosis rates in any amphibian. Though one possibility for <b>their</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> population size could be that, “the pools often dry up before the tadpoles get to complete metamorphosis”(Naish, 2015); though there are countless others.|$|R

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops.

Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E

5|$|Guilty Gear X {{continues}} its predecessor's timeline with new characters and gameplay features.

5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and <b>their</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E
