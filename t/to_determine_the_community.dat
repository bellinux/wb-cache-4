50|$|When {{establishing}} a presence {{at a new}} location after a major disaster, All Hands first conducts a thorough assessment <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> where they will establish a base, after communicating with local community leadership, following up by inviting a set number of volunteers to join the project base as space and need allows.While many large volunteer organizations request that volunteers pay to participate, All Hands Volunteers only requests that volunteers cover their own travel expenses, while the group raises funds to cover the remaining expenses. Volunteers aren't expected to set a minimum set commitment period, staying {{only as long as}} they can. In addition, the nature of some of the work volunteers perform (mainly cleanup and demolitions in areas affected by natural disasters) is unskilled labor, meaning that volunteers can immediately take part in recovery efforts with little or no training. Work is often limited to physical labor, such as clearing debris or demolishing damaged structures, but has also included building of schools in Haiti, permanent homes in the Philippines, and an ongoing rebuild program in Staten Island NY as part of their Sandy response. The organization has engaged volunteers from more than 45 countries.|$|E

40|$|How <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> {{structure}} of complex networks {{is an open}} question. It is critical to establish the best strategies for community detection in networks of unknown structure. Here, using standard synthetic benchmarks, we show {{that none of the}} algorithms hitherto developed for community structure characterization perform optimally. Significantly, evaluating the results according to their modularity, the most popular measure of the quality of a partition, systematically provides mistaken solutions. However, a novel quality function, called Surprise, can be used to elucidate which is the optimal division into communities. Consequently, we show that the best strategy to find the community {{structure of}} all the networks examined involves choosing among the solutions provided by multiple algorithms the one with the highest Surprise value. We conclude that Surprise maximization precisely reveals the community structure of complex networks. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, 2 extra tables. Accepted for publication in Scientific Report...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> health worker barriers to identification, assessment and intervention on the issue of violence against women. The qualitative research method comprised five structured focus group interviews with 28 community health workers using open-ended questions to explore their perceptions. Analysis of the focus group data revealed that community health workers expressed reluctance to become involved in cases of violence against women. The reasons they provided are grouped under three main themes: barriers to identification; barriers to assessment; and barriers to intervention. Training programs offered to rural community health workers need to be aware of the barriers to identifying, assessing and intervening in cases of violence against women that are highlighted by this study. Further studies are needed to assess the wider relevance of these findings to other groups of community health workers in rural and non-rural settings...|$|E
