In this study, an accurate and fast collocation method <b>to</b> <b>collocate</b> VIIRS measurements within CrIS instantaneous field of view (IFOV) directly based on line-of-sight (LOS) pointing vectors is developed and discussed in detail. We demonstrate that this method is not only accurate and precise from a mathematical perspective, but also easy to implement computationally. More importantly, with optimization, this method is very fast and efficient and thus can meet operational requirements. Finally, this collocation method can be extended to a wide variety of sensors on different satellite platforms...|$|R

We then show that under the LPA, stabilizability is only determined by the packet drop probability and not the packet delay probabilities. We also consider a suboptimal state estimator without the LPA, based on inverting submatrices of the observability Krylov sequence. I...|$|R

40|$|Software Architecture (SA) {{evaluation}} process requires {{a large number}} of stakeholders <b>to</b> be <b>collocated</b> for evaluation sessions. Given the increasing trend of using globally distributed software development teams, organizations are likely to be discouraged from introducing disciplined architectural evaluation practices that require stakeholders <b>to</b> be <b>collocated.</b> <b>To</b> address this issue, we propose that SA evaluation can be carried out using suitable groupware systems. In this paper, we present a framework for supporting the SA {{evaluation process}} using groupware systems. The framework highlights the changes required in the existing SA evaluation processes. We provide an illustrated example of modeling and mapping the activities of the proposed process on electronic workspaces provided by a groupware system. We have also identified some of the features a groupware system should have to successfully support the process. Muhammad Ali Baba...|$|R

We decided <b>to</b> <b>collocate</b> with the International Workshop on Parsing Technologies (IWPT), both because the themes of the two events are so closely related and because the seeds of the SPMRL workshop were planted during IWPT 2009 in Paris.
