5|$|The Church {{assigned}} Belcourt to Pembina, North Dakota as {{a missionary}} to <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> and Métis of the Pembina River basin, a tributary to the Red River of the North. Upon arrival at Pembina, Belcourt constructed a small log cabin of 20 feet long by 30 feet wide, {{which was not}} large enough {{for all of his}} congregation. On August 14, 1848, the missionary baptised his first person in Pembina, and held a Holy Communion class consisting of 92 Native Americans. Needing more resources, Belcourt wrote to the Archbishop of Quebec for money for food and building supplies. He also asked for another Canadian priest well-versed in both French and <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> language, as he noted there were more Métis than Chippewa in the Pembina area. Belcourt described the original territory of <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> in the Pembina district as several hundred miles north to south, and east to west - much larger than the small reservation to which they were later assigned.|$|E
5|$|The Sioux people {{consist of}} three main groups, the Lakota in the west, the Western Dakota in the center, and the Eastern Dakota in the east. In the east, the Santee was {{originally}} from the Minnesota area. <b>The</b> <b>Chippewa</b> or Ojibwe people were {{also from the}} same general area. The two tribes had been at war from at least 1736 and by 1750 <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> had forced the Santee to the west into the prairie. The war between the tribes continued until at least the 1850s. Only after 1862, when the Santee rose up against the whites and were subsequently removed to the Dakota Territory, did the fighting cease. In 1872, the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of the Santee signed a treaty that resulted in their moving to the Spirit Lake Reservation.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Belcourt {{travelled}} to Rainy Lake {{to examine}} sites for a mission. He abandoned the plan after discovering that the First Nations people {{were unwilling to}} give up their Hudson's Bay Company-supplied liquor, as he required for conversion to Christianity. In August 1838, the priest arranged to have a dictionary published in <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> language, and returned to his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul. In the winter of 1839, Belcourt carved 280 oak balusters and candlesticks for his log chapel.|$|E

5|$|In November 1849, {{the young}} and {{recently}} ordained priest Albert Lacombe arrived in Pembina and immediately started to learn <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> language. Despite claiming to {{have to resort to}} manual labour to pay for his food, Belcourt supported a household that included a school teacher, a housekeeper, a Chippewa cook and several servants. Thirty miles to the west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chippewa</b> {{believed}} that the least weasel could kill the dreaded wendigo giant by rushing up its anus. In Inuit mythology, the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and whenever a mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least weasel. According to Matthew Hopkins, a witch hunter general during the English Civil War, least weasels were the familiars of witches.|$|E
5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> people of North America as a charm, and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} farmers who {{are not allowed to}} use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with breathable first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from sternal abscesses.|$|E

50|$|The {{highlight}} of Central Michigan's 1992 season was its defeat of Michigan State {{for the second}} consecutive year. <b>The</b> <b>Chippewas</b> had opened <b>the</b> season with a loss to Kentucky before defeating the Spartans, 24-20, at Spartan Stadium on September 12, 1992. Central Michigan quarterback Joe Youngblood, who had been denied a scholarship offer by Michigan State, led <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas</b> by completing 17 of 22 passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns and also catching a pass for 29 yards on a trick play. In a key defensive stand for <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas</b> in <b>the</b> second quarter, Michigan State tailback Craig Thomas fumbled the ball at Central's one-yard line after being hit by Chippewa defensive back Darrall Stinson, and Oscar Ford recovered the ball in the end zone for <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas.</b> In <b>the</b> third quarter, Michigan State kicker Jim DelVerne missed a 31-yard field goal attempt. Brian Pruitt scored a fourth quarter touchdown to put <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas</b> ahead, 24-14.|$|R

5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he repeated his Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins {{for the local}} population, with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on mismanagement by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt served as the chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first mission at Baie-Saint-Paul to teach <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> language {{to a group of}} oblates.|$|E
5|$|In Mt. Pleasant, M-20 runs {{near the}} campus of Central Michigan University {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> River, and the trunkline joins Bus. US127 along the Mission Street business area to Pickard Road. The highway turns east on Pickard and passes under the US127 freeway near the Soaring Eagle Casino. From Mt. Pleasant to Midland, M-20 is designed as a four–lane highway with a continuous center turn lane passing through rural forest land. M-20 picks up inclusion on the NHS from this point east.|$|E
5|$|North of Alma, US127 turns due north {{again and}} crosses into Isabella County. It runs near {{the campus of}} Central Michigan University, {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> River in Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant {{is also home to}} the Saginaw Band of Chippewa Indians and their tribal reservation. The area between the directional interchanges for Bus. US127 in Mount Pleasant is marked by residential neighborhoods; the location of the M-20 interchange has some commercial properties, however. Otherwise, the landscape in Isabella County is mostly farms adjacent to the freeway.|$|E

5|$|Recognized as the {{principal}} chief of the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwa) for nearly a half-century {{until his death in}} 1855, he led his nation into a treaty relationship with the United States Government. He signed treaties in 1825, 1826, 1837, 1842, 1847, and 1854. He was instrumental in resisting the efforts of the United States to remove <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> to western areas and secured permanent Indian reservations for his people near Lake Superior in what is now known as Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Whitefish Bay National Forest Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway {{that runs}} along Whitefish Bay in the Hiawatha National Forest in the U.S. state of Michigan.

As a forest highway, it is {{maintained}} jointly by <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> County Road Commission (CCRC) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The {{route of the}} byway first existed as an earth road by the 1930s; it was improved into a gravel road in the 1940s and paved between the 1950s and the 1980s. The byway designation was created in 1989.|$|E
50|$|First, the {{aboriginal}} group was claiming ownership of privately held land. Previous aboriginal title claims, {{such as in}} Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, had asserted title to crown land only, but here, the disputed Sarnia lands {{had been taken from}} {{the aboriginal}} group and then transferred (mostly) to private individuals and corporations. <b>The</b> <b>Chippewas</b> of Sarnia sought an order that the corporations vacate the land and return it to <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas</b> of Sarnia. With respect to land currently occupied by individuals (i.e. houses), <b>the</b> <b>Chippewas</b> did not ask that it be vacated, but instead sought financial compensation from the government.|$|R

In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA.|$|E
5|$|In Montcalm County, M-66 intersects M-57 in a {{rural area}} south of Sheridan before running north on Sheridan Road through Stanton. The highway jogs west along Main Street in Stanton before {{returning}} to a northerly course on a discontinuous section of Sheridan Road. The roadway curves around the west end of Hemmingway Lake near Cannonsville Road. West of Edmore, M-66 turns northwesterly along M-46 on Edmore–Howard City Road to Six Lakes. M-66 separates there and returns to its northerly journey along Six Lakes Road between Little Bass Lake and First Lake. The road crosses into Mecosta County as 30th Avenue north of Six Lakes. The highway intersects M-20 at the intersection with 9 Mile Road in Remus. This area of rural Mecosta County is more heavily forested with rolling hills and sporadic farms.

5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast–southwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to run around {{the north end of}} the runway complex at <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates.

5|$|On {{behalf of}} Bryan, Legal Services {{attorney}} Patrick Moriarty then sued {{the state and}} Itasca County in the District Court of Itasca County, seeking declaratory relief and an injunction which would prevent the state and county from collecting taxes from Indians on tribal land. This was filed as a class action suit. There was no dispute as to {{the facts of the}} case, so the matter was submitted as a question of law to Judge James F. Murphy. In 1973, the district court held that the state and county were authorized to collect such taxes under Public Law 280. Murphy noted that while <b>the</b> <b>Chippewa</b> had at one time been a sovereign Indian nation, their members were now citizens of Minnesota and received benefits from the state such as county services, the court system, and other like services.|$|E
