Whiteside remained in Belfast, and flew over to Manchester every weekend for training. From age 14, he was constantly compared to the now-retired George Best, and did little to cease such comparisons when he told a journalist that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in common with George Best is that we come from the same place, play for the same club and were discovered by the same man".|$|E

In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a [...] house in Saddle River, New Jersey.

500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It is the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to send home; but I {{do not believe that}} it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen I have ever seen in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his brother dated 19March 1819, Keats {{discussed}} indolence as a subject. He may have written the ode as early as March, but the themes and stanza forms suggest May or June 1819; when it is known he was working on [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". During this period, Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher Richard Woodhouse. Keats wrote to his friend Sarah Jeffrey: [...] "he <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> most enjoyed this year has been writing an ode to Indolence." [...] Despite this enjoyment, however, he was not entirely satisfied with [...] "Ode on Indolence", and it remained unpublished until 1848.|$|E

[...] Moore began a relationship with Bart Freundlich, her director on The Myth of Fingerprints, in 1996. The couple have a son, Caleb (born December 1997) and a daughter, Liv (born April 2002). They wed in August 2003 and live in Greenwich Village, New York City. Moore has commented, [...] "We have a very solid family life, {{and it is the}} most satisfying <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever done."

500|$|The {{shots at}} the Hooters {{restaurant}} were filmed relatively early in the day, {{and a majority of}} the scenes were improvised by Carell.

[...] The scene where Pam and Kelly discuss wedding plans was particularly difficult to shoot all in one scene, due to the amount of activity going on. John Krasinski later noted that he was impressed that the director and cameramen were able to successfully get the shot. The sequence featuring Michael and Jim talking in the break room was made of two composition shots, because Krasinski was laughing [...] "the entire" [...] time. Michael buying Stanley a peach ice tea and telling him that he will [...] "hate it" [...] was entirely improvised.|$|E

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|At 14:17 local time, a {{red flag}} was shown to {{indicate}} the race was stopped and FIA race doctor Sid Watkins arrived at the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under {{a red flag}}, cars must slow down and make {{their way back to}} the pit lane or starting grid unless notified of a restart. This protects race marshals and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the Larrousse team mistakenly allowed one of their drivers, Érik Comas, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically waved him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at [...] "pretty much full speed". Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as [...] "the most ridiculous <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen at any time in my life". Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race.|$|E
500|$|Still instructing in England {{following}} {{the end of}} the war, Cobby was chosen to lead the AFC's Anzac Day flypast over London before the Prince of Wales on 25April 1919, in concert with a parade by Australian soldiers. By 2:30 in the afternoon, he was taking his 50-strong aerial formation through a series of wild stunts over the alarmed Prince's head, and later told the story that he flew so close to the marching soldiers that their bayonets almost pierced his undercarriage. Cobby later said that this was: [...] "probably the most foolish <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever done". He returned to Australia in May 1919, and married Hilda Maude Urban in Caulfield, Victoria, on 24April 1920; the couple had a son and a daughter. Following the disbandment of the AFC, Cobby transferred to the short-lived Australian Air Corps before joining the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. Ranked flying officer (honorary flight lieutenant), {{he was one of the}} original 21 officers on the air force's strength at its formation that March. His first posting, along with most of his colleagues, was to a mixed squadron equipped primarily with S.E.5s and DH.9s at No.1 Flying Training School, based at RAAF Point Cook. [...] Flight Lieutenant Cobby became Commanding Officer (CO) of No.1 Squadron when it was reformed at Point Cook on 1July 1925, serving in the position until August 1926.|$|E

She began her theatrical career by appearing in [...] and The Sound of Music at Monmouth County's Jewish Community Center. Tisdale was eight years old when she was cast to play the part of Cosette in the musical Les Misérables, and only recalled taking a single singing lesson before landing the role.

500|$|Sukumar {{then began}} working on the script of Jagadam (2007), a crime film {{starring}} Ram Pothineni and Isha Sahni. Unlike Arya, Jagadam focused more on violence and {{in an interview with}} South Scope, Sukumar called the film an [...] "act of bravado", adding that he [...] "made it with an innocent passion", without thinking about the audience's response. Jagadam received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. While Sify called the film a [...] "not so much a plot-driven film" [...] albeit praising the work of its technical crew, Rediff called it a [...] "good effort". He then wrote and directed Arya 2 (2009), which was promoted as the namesake sequel of his debut Arya. It featured Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep in the lead roles and narrated the story of Arya, a psychotic orphan whose love for his friend Ajay and his colleague Geetha is never reciprocated. Sify called it Sukumar's [...] "another celluloid misadventure" [...] after Jagadam and stated that he [...] "fails both as a writer and director as his plotline is confusing and his hero's characterization is negative". However, Arya 2 became one of the few successful Telugu films of the year, and was praised for its style quotient and music. Sukumar received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 57th Filmfare Awards South ceremony, but lost it to S. S. Rajamouli for Magadheera.
