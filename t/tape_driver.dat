50|$|In 1983, Everex shipped {{its first}} hard drive, tape backup and {{graphics}} product. Seven years later, with an ever expanding product line, annual revenues totaled over $436 million and the workforce topped 2,200 employees. In 1985, Everex began shipping personal computers under private labels {{such as the}} popular IBM-AT compatible System 1800. Three years later the STEP computer line launched, introducing cutting edge 286 and 386-based computing to a mass audience. In addition to computer systems, high-performance file servers and a UNIX-based operating system (ESIX), the company produced tape drives, graphics boards, data and fax modems, memory enhancement products, network boards, desktop publishing products, disk drive and <b>tape</b> <b>driver</b> controllers and monitors.|$|E
50|$|Decompiling allowed not {{to waste}} RAM in {{simulating}} an absent Block System, used with both disk and <b>tape</b> <b>drivers</b> (these last {{not to be}} confused with tape recorders). As replacement, it included an extra data file, for raw binary data. These solutions were unique to the Jupiter ACE, making Ace Forth much more than Forth alone on a disk-less entry computer. There was no need to buy, or load, Forth to get full usage of a cheap computer.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an ecological}} Europeanization framework {{that provides the}} opportunity to determine the actual size of European and national rule stocks as objective measures of potential sources of external red <b>tape</b> <b>drivers.</b> We illustrate our ecological framework with the case of Dutch competition law for the period running from 1962 to 2010. Applying our framework, we infer the share of European rules in the entire national rule population, thus revealing {{what part of the}} national rule stock is Europeanized. We find that all rule stocks in our sample have increased drastically over time. Moreover, European rules have different effects at the national rule stock level, depending on rule type. European rules serve as weak substitutes for Dutch formal laws, and as complements for Dutch secondary rules. We discuss how the ecological method of measuring external law evolution may inform future organizational red tape research specifically, and studies into formalization generally...|$|R
50|$|A similar {{system to}} Cabvision was {{licensed}} to Cabtivate, which {{was installed in}} taxis in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. According to the company's website, the system updates remotely without pre-recorded DVDs or video <b>tapes.</b> The <b>driver</b> has no control over the Cabtivate system and individual vehicles can be programmed for specific content. However, the company behind Cabtivate has since experienced financial difficulties and is unlikely to install any further units despite provisional approval from the Public Carriage Office. Accordingly, Cabvision is currently the only system authorised by the PCO operating in London.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{starts off}} with the ice cream truck (which is {{on the cover of}} the album Coal Chamber) {{rounding}} a turn and slowly coming to a stop with the beginning of the song playing. When Fafara says the opening line of [...] "Pull", a crazed ice cream truck driver gets off the truck and heads into a nearby house which is home to the members of Coal Chamber. One by one, the driver hunts them down and forces them to stare into a View Master, which shows Coal Chamber performing the song. Bassist Rayna Foss is first, as the driver sneaks up on her as she is playing a game of jacks. Singer B. Dez Fafara is next, as the driver surprises him while he is sewing a stuffed animal's head back on. Guitarist Miguel [...] "Meegs" [...] Rascon is the next victim, caught by the driver while he is staring at an empty rocking chair. Drummer Mikey [...] "Bug" [...] Cox is the final victim, as the driver victimizes him while he is sitting on a mattress watching TV. At the end of the video, the driver has tied the band members to chairs in the basement of the house and has attached a View Master to each member's head with duct <b>tape.</b> The <b>driver</b> then leaves the house and drives away.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, when Retrospect {{was first}} {{developed}} by Dantz Development Corporation, comparatively-inexpensive random access drives {{with the capacity}} to hold copies {{of the contents of}} multiple machines hard drives did not yet exist. Tape drives were not (and still are not) random access, and reliable tape drives were also expensive (and still are). Therefore the pull approach—which sequentially backs up one client-attached or host-attached disk drive at a time—was the only feasible solution to multi-machine network backup so long as a tape drive attached to the [...] "backup server" [...] was the only feasible backup destination. Dantz developed an expertise in custom-rewriting <b>tape</b> drive manufacturers <b>driver</b> software (not always perfectly), which helped Retrospect to garner a 90% share of the Macintosh backup market by 2001. Impelled by flattening Macintosh sales around 1995, Dantz started expanding into the Windows market. By 2001 as many copies of Retrospect for Windows were being sold as copies of Retrospect for Macintosh.|$|R
