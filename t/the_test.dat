40|$|Researchers have {{repeatedly}} showed that when students take a <b>test</b> on <b>the</b> studied materials, their retention of information increases on later exams. The memory gain produced by <b>tests</b> is called <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect. <b>The</b> <b>testing</b> effect {{has been demonstrated}} with different materials (e. g., word lists, prose), with different designs (e. g., within-subjects, between-subjects), with different age groups and with different settings (e. g., laboratory, classroom). This thesis offers a novel approach to the assessment of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect: <b>the</b> transfer of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect. Although research on <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect has been flourishing over the last decade, transfer of the effect has not been studied systematically. In this context, the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect refers to whether a learner can utilize the memory gain produced by tests in different contexts. The present study examined the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect in <b>the</b> temporal domain which refers to retention of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect {{over a period of}} time (Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3 and Experiment 4), the knowledge domain which refers to transfer of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect across different levels of learning (Experiment 1, Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) and the modality domain which concerns how the format of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect (Experiment 4). In addition to the laboratory studies, Experiment 3 was conducted in an actual classroom setting incorporating real classroom curriculum. The study revealed that <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect endures over a long period of time varying between 1 and 12 weeks and is transferable across different levels of learning (i. e., lower level and higher level). Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect is affected by the differences in <b>the</b> format of <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> transferability of <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect across different domains indicated that <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect reflects more than rote learning. The findings of the study were discussed in light of two competing theoretical orientations explaining <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect: <b>the</b> retrieval hypothesis and the transfer-appropriate processing framework. Additionally, the practical implications of the study were discussed in relation to the educational system...|$|R
