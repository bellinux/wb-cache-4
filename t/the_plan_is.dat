5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides.

50|$|It was rumoured {{that the}} largest Botanical Gardens will be pioneered in Bidor. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> {{suggested}} by Sultan Nazrin Shah and were strongly endorsed by the then Perak Chief Minister Dato Seri Tajol Rosl.However, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> put on hold when the Orang Asli (aborigines) opposed <b>the</b> <b>plan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> totally called off after the Perak state administration fell to Pakatan Rakyat as soon after the March 2008 general elections.

5|$|On June 24, 2010, WMATA {{adopted a}} six-year capital {{spending}} plan totalling $5 billion. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> funded by the $3 billion from the 2008 Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and increased funding from the participating jurisdictions. The plan includes rebuilding much of its infrastructure for improved safety. The NTSB had recommended replacing Metrorail's oldest series of railcars as not crashworthy, and the spending plan would replace those cars.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> notable {{for the amount}} of financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, {{a campaign of}} Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful, {{according}} to Adam Rovner <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> attractive to early Zionists as it [...] "twinned {{the adventures of}} Morton Stanley with the adventurism of the Age of Empire, stagecraft with statecraft." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1994 {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} Canberra light rail network <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> prepared by consultants Booz Allen Hamiton. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> included six lines, with four to be built by 2004. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> widely criticised by the then opposition ACT Liberal Party and {{when they came to}} power in 1995 <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> abandoned.|$|R
50|$|A {{draft of}} <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by <b>the</b> regional <b>planning</b> Minister on 7 December 2008 {{and it was}} open for public consultation until 1 May 2009. <b>The</b> final approved <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> released on 28 July 2009. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> and its State <b>Planning</b> Regulatory Provisions <b>are</b> administered by the Department of Infrastructure, Local Government and <b>Planning.</b> <b>The</b> South East Queensland Regional <b>Plan</b> <b>is</b> currently being reviewed.

5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpson residence, Marge disapproves of the plan, but {{decides to}} do it for Apu's sake. While <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> under way Homer decides to stay in the Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets into bed with Marge. Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon enters to say goodbye, but is shocked to see Marge in bed with another man, and Apu on the floor. Tired of the whole charade, Marge forces Apu to tell his mother the truth, who declares that the arranged marriage will proceed as planned.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{the house}} was {{threatened}} with demolition {{to make way for}} a seven-story apartment house. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> vigorously opposed by locals, and <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> rejected by both the city's zoning board and the Charleston City Council.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> later {{strongly}} opposed by Malay nationalists and {{they refuse to}} accept equal status for all four language streams of primary education and also the lack of national integration policy and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in 1949.|$|R
50|$|According to Dziewanowski, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> never {{expressed}} in systematic fashion but instead relied on Piłsudski's pragmatic instincts. According to British scholar George Sanford, {{about the time}} of the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 Piłsudski recognized that <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> not feasible.|$|R
5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E
5|$|Number 10, {{also known}} as the Superintendent's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} limestone walls and a corrugated iron roof behind parapet walls. It is connected to the gatehouse with limestone walled buildings. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> roughly square and there is a door from the house into the prison from the north-east room of the ground floor. The house was initially built in 1853 for the Chaplain, but was taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and was later used by the prison administration.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was pressed by regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> initial <b>plans</b> {{released}} in September 2011 generated over 7000 responses from local residents, {{in person and}} online. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> met with a 97% approval rating from respondents. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> enthusiastically backed in December 2011 by Manchester City Council, {{and approved by the}} government in August 2012.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Pyidawtha <b>Plan</b> (ပြည်တော်သာစီမံကိန်း) <b>was</b> {{an eight-year}} {{national}} economic development <b>plan</b> established by <b>the</b> Burmese government in 1952, {{to develop an}} industrialized welfare state in post-colonial Burma. <b>The</b> <b>plan,</b> commissioned under Prime Minister U Nu's leadership, {{was one of the}} first economic development <b>plans</b> to <b>be</b> adopted by a developing country in the post-war decolonization period, and served as a model for other countries. <b>The</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>was</b> initially estimated to cost , with two-thirds for industrial enterprises, and the remainder to fund social services. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> Burma's second national development <b>plan,</b> <b>the</b> first being the 1947 Sorrento Villa <b>Plan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> halted following <b>the</b> 1962 Burmese coup d'état by Ne Win.|$|R

5|$|Terns are {{protected}} by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required {{to engage in a}} wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{is built}} in the 13th century English Gothic style in coursed ragstone with a red-tiled roof and a central wooden belfry, topped by a splayed-foot spire and small dormers at the west end. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> of an aisle-less nave with a lower chancel, north chapel and south porch with a stair tower for the gallery (all at {{the west end of}} the church), with a sacristy linking it to the presbytery in the {{north-east}} corner. The windows are of Bath stone.|$|E
5|$|The Kings County Association of Governments {{has plans}} to improve the state {{highways}} within the county. Developers are interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently {{turned off by the}} lack of freeway access. For SR 198, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I-5. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Strategic <b>Plan</b> <b>was</b> then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who {{represented}} the entire committee. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> accepted {{and approved by the}} Board of Supervisors 26 September 2007. <b>The</b> Strategic <b>Plan</b> has <b>been</b> updated every year since.|$|R

50|$|The Cavalier was a {{new design}} based on the French wooden homebuilt GY-20 Minicab {{designed}} by Yves Gardan in 1949. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> translated from French to English and modified by Stan Mcleod. <b>The</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> marketed by K&S Aircraft of Calgary, Alberta and later MacFam.|$|R
5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} synopsis {{for both}} films {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father thinks his daughter is {{too young to be}} married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan to save his life to win the man's approval. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go through without failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married Bill in the mean time.|$|E
5|$|Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis, {{common to}} many cathedrals, with the chancel {{at the eastern}} end, and the façade to the west. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small {{transept}} {{on the north side}} remaining from an earlier building, and an unusually large south transept. As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16thcentury. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side, and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows {{in each of the three}} cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the design}} work for the GT 102 was {{complete}} by early 1945, and <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>were</b> to have been delivered on 15 February (along with final designs for the GT 101).
