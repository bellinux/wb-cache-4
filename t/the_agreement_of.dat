5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{returned}} to winter quarters, Francis I of France replaced Boutières with François de Vendôme, Count of Enghien, a prince with no experience commanding an army. Francis also sent additional {{troops to the}} Piedmont, including several hundred heavy cavalry, some companies of French infantry from Dauphiné and Languedoc, and a force of quasi-Swiss from Gruyères. In January 1544, Enghien laid siege to Carignano, which was defended by Imperial troops {{under the command of}} Pirro Colonna. The French were of the opinion that d'Avalos would be forced to attempt a relief of the besieged city, at which point he could be forced into a battle; but as such pitched battles were viewed as very risky undertakings, Enghien sent Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc, to Paris to ask Francis for permission to fight one. Montluc apparently convinced Francis to give his assent—contingent on <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> Enghien's captains—over the objections of the Comte de St. Pol, who complained that a defeat would leave France exposed to an invasion by d'Avalos's troops at a time when Charles V and Henry VIII of England were expected to attack Picardy. Montluc, returning to Italy, brought with him nearly a hundred volunteers from among the young noblemen of the court, including Gaspard de Coligny.|$|E

30|$|The {{potential}} {{reason of}} the joint SAFTA and AFTA {{not to have a}} significant welfare effect can be interpreted in different ways. Firstly, SAFTA and AFTA already exist, and hence, the member of these two trade agreements gains nothing from the members within SAFTA and AFTA after <b>the</b> joint <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> SAFTA and AFTA. For example, Bangladesh and India will gain nothing due to <b>the</b> joint <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> SAFTA and AFTA rather they only gain from SAFTA. Secondly, most of the SAFTA member countries have their individual trade <b>agreement</b> with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AFTA member countries. This is the reason, Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal are gaining from <b>the</b> joint <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> SAFTA and AFTA, i.e., they don’t have trade <b>agreement</b> with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members of AFTA. Hence, <b>the</b> joint <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> SAFTA and AFTA could bring welfare for these countries. Thirdly, the trade diversion effect on the world and the third country is almost negligible, because the trade diversion effect individually from SAFTA and AFTA is already very small. Hence, <b>the</b> joint <b>agreement</b> <b>of</b> SAFTA and AFTA would not change anything to the third countries.|$|R
