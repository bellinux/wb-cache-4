5|$|The {{history of}} Rameswaram is centred {{around the island}} being a transit point to reach Sri Lanka (Ceylon historically) and the {{presence}} of Ramanathaswamy Temple. Tevaram, the 7th–8th century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent Nayanars (Saivites) namely Appar, Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar. The Chola king Rajendra Chola I (1012 – 1040 CE) had a control of the <b>town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short period. The Jaffna kingdom (1215–1624 CE) had close connections with the island and claimed the title Setukavalan meaning custodians of the Rameswaram. Hinduism was their state religion and they made generous contribution to the temple. Setu was used in their coins as well as in inscriptions as marker of the dynasty.|$|E

The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees until he sees something to set them apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire for stealing from the skate shop.|$|E
5|$|Wild had {{thoughts}} of a second, more productive {{season in the}} ice, and took the ship to Cape <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> refit. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death.|$|E
5|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, {{there was a need}} to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was {{recruited}} for a fee of £1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> club-record combined fee of £800,000 which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{returned}} to Newmarket <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pre-season friendly game with Brentford in August 2004, {{during which he}} scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win. It helped him to win {{a place in the}} first team, and he scored {{on the first day of}} the 2004–05 season when Brentford lost 3–1 to Chesterfield. It was not until November 2004 that he scored his second goal in another defeat—2–1 to Bradford City. Five days later, he scored the winning penalty against Bristol City to take Brentford through to the second round of the FA Cup. In December, Rhodes scored in successive games, first in the league against Sheffield Wednesday, then another penalty in the FA Cup as Brentford's 2–1 victory against Hinckley United set up a third round tie with Luton Town. He was unable to play in the third round tie after he suffered a serious knee injury against Walsall which kept him out of action for the rest of the season. Although Rhodes had been a regular in the Brentford squad, his 22 league games included just four starts.|$|E
5|$|Winger Simon Russell {{signed for}} the club from Kidderminster Harriers.

Beadle was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, having not made any appearances in 2008–09. Sodje scored with a late volley after coming off the bench to give York a 1–1 draw away to Torquay United to maintain the team's unbeaten record, which looked under threat after Danny Stevens gave Torquay the lead on 65 minutes. Sodje's goal against Torquay won the first Conference Premier Goal of the Month competition, for August 2008.|$|E
5|$|York {{started the}} season with a 2–1 defeat at home to Kidderminster Harriers, who opened the scoring with a goal direct from a corner kick. After Michael Rankine {{equalised}} on 68 minutes with a penalty, Kidderminster won the match with a penalty three minutes later. Hopcutt was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month. The team's first away match of the season was against Grimsby Town, with the match finishing a 0–0 draw. This was followed by another away draw, with Michael Gash and Till scoring against Bath City as the match finished 2–2. York then drew 0–0 at home to Barrow and the team's first victory of the season came after Rankine and Richard Brodie scored to beat Altrincham 3–0 at home. The team were defeated 2–1 away by Fleetwood Town, where Young made his debut and scored York's only goal.

5|$|Bostwick {{began his}} career as a trainee with Millwall, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, as well as playing several times for the reserve team. During the latter stages of the 2005–06 season, Bostwick joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work experience. The move counted as work experience, as opposed to a loan, because of Bostwick's age – {{subsequently}} he could not appear for the first team of another Football League club, but was eligible to play for the first team of a non-league club. He made his debut for Crawley a week after joining the club, coming on as an 89th minute substitute in a 1–0 victory against Forest Green Rovers. He came on in the 83rd minute in the following match against Southport at Haig Avenue, as well as playing for 25 minutes against Burton Albion, setting up Tony Scully's 89th-minute equaliser. He subsequently started his first match in April 2006, playing the whole match in a 2–0 win against Aldershot Town, scoring Crawley's second. A week later, Bostwick scored both of Crawley's goals in the club's 2–2 draw against Halifax Town, netting in quick succession to give Crawley a two-goal lead. He played a total of eight matches for Crawley during his two-month work experience, scoring three times. On return to his parent club in May 2006, Bostwick signed a one-year contract with Millwall. Shortly before the start of the 2006–07 season, Bostwick was loaned out to Crawley <b>Town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second spell at the club. He played in the club's first five matches of the season, scoring twice from midfield in a 3–2 away win at Stevenage. In late August 2006, Crawley Town extended the loan deal until the end of the season, although Millwall were able to recall him in the January transfer window if they deemed it necessary. Bostwick played a total of 25 times during the first half of the season, scoring twice, before Millwall recalled him in January 2007.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from <b>town</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E
