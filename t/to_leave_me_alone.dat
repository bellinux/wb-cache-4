500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip I have to take. People just kind of have <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> when I'm doing it. It's my job." [...] Singer described his impression of the character: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> for some reason, I don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail {{was so important to}} Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
6000|$|Albert groaned hollowly. [...] "When you've {{finished}} torkin', I wish you'd kindly {{have the}} goodness <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone.</b> I'm not meself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] she admitted. [...] "All the same, you {{are rather}} an inconsiderate guest, aren't you, <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone</b> in this swamp?" ...|$|R
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. Oh! I {{hope you}} are not going <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> all <b>alone</b> with Lord Goring? Especially at such an early hour in the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "A month ago," [...] she {{continued}} reflectively, [...] "my mother {{would never have}} thought it possible <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone.</b> Perhaps she may be getting worried now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam, I will try," [...] {{said the}} child, {{with a great}} gulp; [...] "only {{if you would be}} pleased not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> with him the first time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{done with}} you, Link," [...] he said. [...] "And I am done with Haskers, too. All I {{want you to}} do is <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> in the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew Struthers," [...] said Gavin solemnly, [...] "in {{the name}} of God I order you <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone.</b> If you don't," [...] he added ferociously, [...] "I'll fling you over the stair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was to {{tell you}} that I {{released}} you. I love Raffles Haw, and I was to have been his wife. And now it is all gone. Oh, Hector, I hate you, and I shall always hate you as long as I live, for you have stepped between me and the only good fortune that ever came <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone,</b> and I hope that you will never cross our threshold again." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. FULLARTON. [In a {{low voice}} <b>to</b> TWISDEN] Please <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> with her, don't say {{anything}} to Mr. Dedmond yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} {{treated me like}} a friend," [...] he said, passionately; [...] "you {{had no right to}} {{continue}} the search unless I searched with you--you had no right <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone.</b> I was wrong to trust you; you are no better than all the rest of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, I'll {{start for}} the woods," [...] said Deering. [...] "The trouble is to hit the proper line. It's {{possible}} the police are willing <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone,</b> but I mustn't help them get on to Jimmy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Haven’t you tormented {{me enough}} to-day?” it said. [...] . My head was steady now {{but my heart}} began to beat violently. I listened to the end without moving, “Can’t you {{make up your mind}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> for to-night?” It pleaded with an accent of {{charitable}} scorn.|$|E
6000|$|... "You urge {{me to try}} a chance, {{to marry}} you now and trust to luck for it to come out right. And life is a gamble say. Very well, let us gamble. Take a coin and toss it in the air. If it comes heads, I'll marry you. If it doesn't, you are forever <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> and never mention {{marriage}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Delightful!" [...] she murmured. [...] "But I mustn't {{think of}} it," [...] she added, {{with a sudden}} gravity, [...] "nor must {{you talk to me}} like that. What my uncle says is best to be done. He knows and understands. If he has had <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone,</b> it is because it is necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I'm done for," [...] said Tom. [...] "The cussed sneaking dog, <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> die <b>alone!</b> My {{poor old}} mother {{always told me}} 't would be so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no desire}} for a chat with any one," [...] Crawshay objected. [...] "I came up on deck to rest. Kindly ask {{me what you want}} <b>to</b> know and <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> for a time." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt I had sacrificed too much, {{that after}} I had {{said good-bye to}} the hot {{immediate}} life of passion, to Nettie and desire, to physical and personal rivalry, to all that was most intensely myself, it was wrong <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> and sore hearted, to go on at once with these steely cold duties of the wider life. I felt new born, and naked, and at a loss.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} simple, sir. The Afridis were but twenty paces away, when I started the colonel's horse. I saw that {{fighting}} would be hopeless, so threw down my sword and pistol. I {{should have been}} cut up at once, had not their chief shouted to them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone,</b> and to fire after Colonel Houghton. This they did and, I was happy to see, without success." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} Lady Claudia, evidently unwilling <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> with her. [...] "Fear nothing," [...] I said; [...] "I am {{old enough to}} take care of myself. I have only a word to say to this lady before I leave the house." [...] With that, I took his arm, and walked with him to the door, and said good-by almost as composedly as if we had been husband and wife already.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here alone?" [...] cried the girl; her tones marked the fear which the {{prospect}} induced. [...] "You are going <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone</b> in this terrible jungle, a prey to wild beasts and savage men, {{hundreds of miles}} from a white settlement and in a country which gives every evidence of never having been touched by the foot of civilized men?" ...|$|R
40|$|My sincere {{thanks to}} all the staff in Homecare, without you this {{would not have been}} possible. It has been such a {{pleasure}} working with you. Thank you also to all the staff in my department who encouraged and supported me throughout this endeavour, especially for the period of study leave which made such a difference. Thanks also to all the staff and participants on the EdD programme for making the five years an interesting and challenging process. I would like to say a sincere thank you to my supervision team-Professor Helen Burchell, Dr Roger Levy and Dr Steve Shelley who brought expertise, guidance and kind words when they were needed. I am particularly grateful to Helen who challenged and supported me unstintingly throughout with such grace, good humour and conviction. Finally, thanks to my family and friends who provided such a range of support from cups of tea, wine, food, discussion, practical help and fun, <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> <b>to</b> work without forgetting me...|$|R
5000|$|He is God! O My Shoghi, I {{have no time}} <b>to</b> talk, <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone!</b> You said write, I have written. What {{else should}} be done? Now {{is not the time}} for you to read and write. It is the time for jumping about and {{chanting}} O My God! Therefore, memorize the prayers of the Blessed Beauty and chant them that I may hear them. Because there is no time for anything else.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Gone! gone where?' said she. 'You ain't going <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone,</b> you nasty thing; you ain't {{going to}} the village to dance, you ragged, barefooted slut: you're all of a piece in this house--your mother, your brothers, and you. I know you've got meat in the kitchen, and you only give me black bread;' and here the old lady began to scream as if her heart would break; {{but we did not}} mind it, we were so used to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "In this {{expedition}} to the 'Bishop's Hotel' I had been attended by Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone.</b> But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived {{to give him the}} slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After much toil I found it. When I came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well acquainted as myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{say much}} for myself just at present; {{it is only}} {{about half an hour}} since they {{finished}} bandaging me up and putting on splints; they just stopped the bleeding last night, and then I asked them <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> until this morning. They had lots of serious cases to attend to, and mine would keep well enough; besides, I was so weak with loss of blood, and so really done up, that I felt that I could not stand any more then, and I was asleep in a very few minutes. However, my arm woke me up before daylight, and I was glad enough to have it put in proper shape, though it hurt me deucedly, I can tell you. However, it is comparatively easy now, and I hope I shall be all right by the time the advance begins. What a blessing it is having shade and water here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} forming the same opinion, my lord; and, to say truth, {{was about to}} propose to your lordship <b>to</b> withdraw, and <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> with the poor woman. My sex will make her {{necessary}} communications more frank in your lordship's absence." ...|$|R
60|$|As I have said, {{the grapes}} may be sour, and I enjoy the want of luxuries only because I cannot get them; but if my self-deception be useful <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>leave</b> it <b>alone.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term Cold Seeds {{refers to}} the project as a whole, {{encompassing}} {{the name of the}} group and the title of the album that emerged from the collaboration. The name is derived from Frances Donnelly's lyrics <b>to</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> Lie <b>Alone</b> In The Ground.|$|R
60|$|She {{had slept}} {{just long enough}} to lose the lovely {{entrance}} of Dublin Bay, stiffen her limbs, and confuse her brains, and she stood still as the stream of passengers began to rush trampling by her, feeling bewildered and forlorn. Her cousin's voice was welcome, though over-loud and somewhat piteous. 'Where are you, stewardess? where's the young lady? Oh! Cilly, there you are. <b>To</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> all this time, and here's the stewardess saying we must go ashore at once, or lose the train. Oh! the luggage, and I've lost my plaid,' and ghastly in the lamplight, limp and tottering, Rashe Charteris clasped her arm for support, and made her feel doubly savage and bewildered. Her first movement was to enjoin silence, then to gaze about for the goods. A gentleman took pity on the two ladies, and told them not to be deluded into trying to catch the train; there would be another in an hour's time, and if they had any one to meet them, they would most easily be found where they were.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trouble with}} me is that I'm lonesome," [...] {{repeated}} Peter Rabbit {{as he sat in}} the dear Old Briar-patch. [...] "Yes, Sir, that's the only thing that's wrong with me. I'm just tired of myself, and that's why I've lost my appetite. And now I know what's the matter, what am I going to do about it? If I were sure, absolutely sure, that Old Man Coyote meant what he said about our being friends, I'd start out this very minute to call on all my old friends. My, my, my, it seems an age since I visited the Smiling Pool and saw Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter! Mr. Coyote sounded as if he really meant <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone,</b> but, but--well, perhaps he did mean it when he saw me sitting here safe among the brambles, but if I should meet him out in the open, he might change his mind and--oh, dear, his teeth are terrible long and sharp!" ...|$|E
60|$|The coolness {{with which}} this was said amazed me not a little, though I {{was not so}} silly as to believe a {{syllable}} of it. Opportunity {{had a great deal}} of vulgar sentimentalism about her, it is true--such as some girls are apt to mistake for refinement; but she was not quite so bad as to travel that lane, at midnight, and alone, without some special object. It occurred to me that this object might be connected with her brother, and that she would naturally wish to make her communications privately. We had all taken seats at a table which occupied the centre of the room, Mary and myself quite near each other, and Opportunity at a distant angle. I wrote on a slip of paper a short request for Mary <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> with our visitor, and laid it under her eyes, without exciting Opportunity's suspicion; talking to her, the whole time, about the night, and the weather, and her ride. While we were thus engaged, Miss Warren rose, and quietly glided out of the room. So silently was this done, that I do not believe my remaining companion was conscious of it at the moment.|$|E
6000|$|Backwards and forwards, with silent tread, [...] I {{walked on}} my watch by {{the doors of}} the dead. [...] And I said, It's hard, on this New Year, [...] While the rest are dancing <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here, [...] <b>Alone</b> with death and cold and fear-- [...] Poor me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Bax, {{after having}} firmly {{resisted}} his companion's utmost efforts, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> here <b>alone.</b> I {{may seem to}} you to be obstinate and ungracious to-night" [...] (he stopped and seized Guy's hand), [...] "but, believe me, I am not so. My heart is terribly down, and you know I'm a rough matter-of-fact fellow, not given to be sentimental, so I can't speak to you as I would wish on this subject; but wherever I may go in this world, I will never cease to pray for God's blessing on you and yours, Guy." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{being able}} {{to arrive at a}} conclusion, the {{practitioners}} remanded me for farther examination. I was taken up into a garret; and the surgeon's lady having accommodated me with drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief--then bolted the door on the outside as he hurried <b>to</b> his dinner, <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> <b>alone</b> <b>to</b> silence and to meditation.|$|R
