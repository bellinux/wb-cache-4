5|$|Chinese forces counterattacked, {{destroying}} a 3rd Infantry Division {{tank column}} sent {{to assist the}} Rangers and attacking the 3rd Ranger Company from three sides, as <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> into a hill. Though the Rangers eventually were forced to withdraw, {{the defense of the}} Rangers, the US 3rd Division and the British 29th Brigade had broken the momentum of the Chinese offensive.|$|E
5|$|Improbably, the {{excavators}} {{found the}} {{remains in the}} first location in which <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> at the car park. Coincidentally, they lay almost directly under a roughly painted 'R' on the tarmac. This had existed since the early 2000s to signify a reserved parking space.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used {{strategic}} methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive their opponents of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> a trench to render the enemy cavalry ineffective.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{relatively}} small size of Trinity's graveyard, when graves were <b>dug,</b> <b>they</b> were <b>dug</b> deep and coffins were stacked {{on top of each}} other to maximise the use of space.|$|R
50|$|Evidences {{show that}} <b>they</b> were <b>dug</b> by the Zoroastrian {{inhabitants}} {{who used to}} live there because the cave entrances open to the east where the sun rises.|$|R

5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced {{back and the}} Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but were unable to break the British line. <b>They</b> <b>dug</b> in and waited for tank support before moving forward again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. <b>They</b> <b>dug</b> ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because {{both ends of the}} canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. <b>They</b> <b>dug</b> up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} why <b>they</b> had <b>dug</b> a great {{hole in the}} ground merely to bury dry bones. Surely there was no sense in that; no one wanted to steal dry bones.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> quickly <b>dug</b> another long, narrow hole. Then, {{taking a}} rude stretcher, they plodded {{away in the}} {{direction}} of a dilapidated tent that appeared to be the only structure left of Benton. Casey entered ahead of his comrade.|$|R
5000|$|The seeds can {{be buried}} for about 14 days until they germinate. Then <b>they</b> are <b>dug</b> up and eaten after the sprout has been removed. This way of {{preparation}} {{is said to}} minimize the danger of intoxication by jengkolic acid.|$|R
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. <b>They</b> <b>dug</b> them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which {{relied on}} rain to water their crops, but others {{utilized}} runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe {{that prior to}} the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited {{to members of the}} surrounding community.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and a steam shovel from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> the foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
2500|$|At first, the families, {{referred}} to as [...] "los Bravos" [...] or the [...] "Heralds of Peace", lived under trees, but <b>they</b> soon <b>dug</b> themselves [...] shelters, covering them with automobile hoods recovered from garbage dumps outside the cities of Casa Grande and Eloy.|$|R
50|$|The Scouts of the Gideon de Carrefour {{group have}} pulled out about 300 cadavers {{from under the}} debris and saved about 725, have {{fabricated}} coffins for the dozen Scouts who died, and <b>they</b> have <b>dug</b> a communal trench to bury 150 of the dead.|$|R
5000|$|At first, the families, {{referred}} to as [...] "los Bravos" [...] or the [...] "Heralds of Peace", lived under trees, but <b>they</b> soon <b>dug</b> themselves subterranean shelters, covering them with automobile hoods recovered from garbage dumps outside the cities of Casa Grande and Eloy.|$|R
5|$|In rough {{seas and}} under enemy fire, the commandos began {{disembarking}} at Jig, some distance east of their intended position, at 09:50. Five of their LCAs were sunk by beach obstacles or enemy fire, {{at the cost}} of 76 casualties. Major P. M. Donnell temporarily took charge until Phillips and some others who had got separated from the unit rejoined the group at 14:00 along the Meuvaines–Le Carrefour road. The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> in for the night. The town and port were captured in the battle of Port-en-Bessin on 7–8 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Jordan Valley, Chaytor's Force faced stiff {{opposition}} from the Ottoman front line troops. As a consequence of progress made by the 160th Brigade during the afternoon of 19 September, one of the brigade's mountain batteries {{was able to get}} in a position to fire on Bakr Ridge. At 14:25, supported by the 160th Brigade's battery, three companies of the 2nd Battalion British West Indies Regiment (Chaytor's Force) destroyed Ottoman outposts and captured a ridge to the south of Bakr Ridge, despite intense artillery and machine gun fire. Under heavy fire, <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> in and held their position while two regiments of 2nd Light Horse Brigade were able to advance towards Shunet Nimrin.|$|E
25|$|Brahe {{left the}} depot on Cooper Creek {{on the morning}} of Sunday, 21 April 1861. Burke, Wills and King {{returned}} that evening. Finding the camp deserted, <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> up the cache of supplies, and a letter explaining that the party had given up waiting and had left. Burke's team had missed them by only nine hours. The three men and two remaining camels were exhausted; they had no hope of catching up to the main party.|$|E
25|$|Wild boar (Tamil: kaattu panri) live {{all over}} the Palani Hills and in Manjampatti Valley, where one can {{frequently}} see holes in the ground where <b>they</b> have <b>dug</b> for edible roots. The valley has the large mountain squirrel (Tamil: malai-anil) and the ash-colored squirrel (Tamil: saambalnira anil).|$|R
5000|$|The {{excavation}} team laid gravel in {{the pathways}} <b>they</b> had <b>dug.</b> The Smith family opened their business as the Ohio Caverns in 1925 with a 1 mi guided tour route {{that did not}} include the [...]25 mi section that Reams' early visitors had explored and ravaged.|$|R
60|$|The {{ferocity of}} the Indians cost them dear. <b>They</b> had <b>dug</b> up and scalped the corpses in the {{graveyard}} of Fort William Henry. Many of these {{had died of}} smallpox, and the savages took the infection home to their villages, where great numbers perished of the disease.|$|R
25|$|On Friday 3 July about 1,000 {{soldiers}} and 1,000 police were deployed in Portadown. The soldiers built large barricades (made of steel, concrete and barbed wire) across all roads {{leading into the}} nationalist area. In the fields between Drumcree Church and the nationalist area <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> a trench, fourteen feet wide, which was then lined with rows of barbed wire. Soldiers also occupied the Catholic Drumcree College, St John the Baptist Primary School, and some properties near the barricades.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday morning, 25 June 2006, {{at about}} 5:30am (GMT+2) an armed squad of Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip {{crossed the border}} into Israel via a 300-meter-long {{underground}} tunnel <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> near the Kerem Shalom border crossing. The militants surfaced in Israeli territory shielded by a row of trees, and came up behind IDF border positions facing Gaza. As militants from within the Gaza Strip bombarded Israeli positions with mortar and anti-tank fire, the militant squad split into three cells.|$|E
25|$|Union report {{described}} {{the capture of}} 2000 lbs. of buried bacon on July 3 at Augusta. According to the reports, freed slaves in the area led Union forces to a new grave that had a head board and a foot board but no name. When <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> it up 2000lbs of bacon was discovered. The freed slaves indicated that a force of 400 Confederates had fled the area following a skirmish {{at one of the}} barricades the day before (July 2). This appears to match General Rust's report that the enemy had captured Matlock’s Bacon.|$|E

50|$|The South Pennines provide {{evidence}} of Mesolithic, the late Bronze Age and Iron Age findings. The Romans built roads and built forts in Ilkley and at Castleshaw. <b>They</b> also <b>dug</b> coal which was further exploited especially during the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.|$|R
25|$|The first {{contacts}} that Islam {{had with}} Australia was when Muslim fishermen native to Makassar, which is today {{a part of}} Indonesia, visited North-Western Australia long before British settlement in 1788. This contact of South East Asian ethnic groups of Islamic faith can be identified from the graves <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> for their comrades who died on the journey, being that they face Mecca (in Arabia), in accordance with Islamic regulations concerning burial, as well as evidence from Aboriginal cave paintings and religious ceremonies which depict and incorporate the adoption of Makassan canoe designs and words.|$|E
25|$|The head of {{the cross}} was {{discovered}} by soldiers in 1873 and {{at the request of}} the vicar of the nearby village of Shaugh Prior they erected it on the spot where it was found. By 1901 it had fallen again and it remained so until 1915 when Hugh Breton, the vicar of Sheepstor, arranged for it to be re-erected on a new shaft. After searching for a suitable site to re-erect it, <b>they</b> <b>dug</b> a hole and fortuitously discovered the original socket-stone which they raised to ground level and re-used.|$|E
25|$|In August 1963, Lair {{received}} {{an order to}} cut Route 7 between the Plain of Jars and the Vietnamese border. After Lair's training, PARU troopers, accompanying and directing 12 platoons of Hmong from their Special Guerrilla Units, infiltrated to a portion of Route 7 that ran along steep cliffs. The saboteurs planted double cratering charges in each of 120 demolition pits <b>they</b> <b>dug,</b> and exfiltrated. When the explosions blew {{in the middle of}} the night, two sections of clifftop road migrated downwards. Once again, Lair let Pop Buell claim credit. The Route 7 communist supply line would remain cut until November.|$|E
