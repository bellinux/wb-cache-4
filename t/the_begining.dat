The paper tries to evaluate, through the estimation of convergence coefficients, if the increments achieved have widened or closed the gap between EU member states. Results indicate that the richest countries either maintain their positive differences to the Union's average (Netherlands and Belgium) or even enlarge it (Denmark). France shows a quick convergence pattern, while countries where Mediterranean production exceeds 30 % of Total Agricultural Output either keep their negative gap (Italy), or even enlarge it (Greece) or slowly converge to the average (Spain). Portugal does converge but {{still has a long}} way to reach its European partners. For the remaining countries no significant convergence coefficients were found. ...|$|R

At <b>the</b> <b>begining</b> Eduroam covered small parts of faculties and schools, but it evolved and is now covering large campuses and student dorms. Large wireless networks bring new challenges for their maintainers. For efficient control and provisioning of wireless access points a new solution was needed. In this thesis we presented centralized wireless architecture as the solution. We set up a test Eduroam lab with equipment for centralized wireless network management. We evaluated usability and recommended possible use cases of equipment for centralized management in Eduroam wireless network. We also tested security and compared it to autonomous Eduroam networks...|$|E

Among the important documents there was a proposal law on the amendments of Law of Serbian Army, that seemed of a less impor-tance.

40|$|Since <b>the</b> very <b>begining</b> {{of quantum}} theory there started {{a debate on}} {{the proper role of}} space and time in it. Some authors assumed that space and time have their own {{algebraic}} operators. On that basis they supposed that quantum particles had “coordinates of position”, even though those coordinates were not possible to determine with infinite precision. Furthermore, time in quantum physics was taken to be on an equal foot, by means of a so-called “Heisenberg’s fourth relation of indeterminacy” concerning time and energy. In this paper, the proper role of space and time in the core of non-relativistic quantum phsysics is analyzed. We will find that, rigorously, that relation for time and energy shows a different root. For the role of space, it will be discussed that there is no “coordinate of position” in the conceptual structure of quantum physics because quantum particles are not point-like objects...|$|R

This study is based on a variety of historical documents: business economics and accounting dissertations and other research studies, academic textbooks, articles in professional journals, study guides for business school programmes etc. Our aim is to produce a comprehensive picture of the development of accounting as an academic subject and a part of business economics in Finland. ...|$|R
