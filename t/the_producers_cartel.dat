In 2014 he is increasingly renowned and respected for his outstanding, and often heroically long, House & Techno DJ sets. His One Series events (One DJ, One Room, All Night) epitomize his passionate and community-orientated spirit, cultivating a devoted following of participants and creative collaborators around the world. He also manages the Stereophoenix label, which describes its ethos as Electronic Music with Heart & Soul.|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{conditions}} under which <b>producer</b> <b>cartels</b> organized by primary producing countries to increase real external purchasing power (income terms of trade) can most effectively achieve their objectives. To this effect, conventional cartel theory is expanded so as to include the impact of the major institutional factors, with emphasis on centre-periphery (North-South) relationships, the roles played by governments of producing and consuming countries, by transnational enterprises as well as the particular conditions of supply and demand of various commodities. This framework is applied to bauxite, coffee and sugar industries, because each presents unique characteristics. As a principal focus of this study, a comparative analysis of these commodities is undertaken. The analysis demonstrates that a bauxite cartel has the potential to gain large monopoly profits, but the evidence is against the long run profitability and stability of coffee and sugar cartels. The differences in the characteristics of the primary commodities differentiate the behaviour of cartels and the expected outcomes. Ultimately, the benefits of successful cartels will have to be measured by how the financial gains are used to transform internal structures, eliminate poverty, and promote social justice. As well as being useful for the study of primary commodity cartels in general, this analysis can also aid policy makers concerned with <b>producer</b> <b>cartels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of domestic production raises a difficulty for arms export control measures, since embargoes, {{by raising the}} effective price of imports, increase the incentive for domestic production. We address this issue by developing a partial equilibrium model of the international arms market We compare three arms export regimes involving the exporters of high-technology arms, with a particular focus {{on the effect of}} emerging domestic production: laissez-faire trade, the uncoordinated regulation of exports and a <b>producer</b> <b>cartel</b> consisting of coordinated regulation.

40|$|Primary food {{producers}} {{are permitted to}} bargain as a group for higher prices. Supply response, however, {{is critical to the}} long-run success of <b>producer</b> <b>cartels.</b> This article presents a model that elucidates that role of supply response in agricultural price bargaining when no overt action is taken to limit quantity and participation in the cartel is voluntary. Free-riding, for example, is seen as having a dual nature: it undermines the cartel's influence at the negotiating table but it enhances the cartel's ability to sustain a negotiated price increase by attenuating supply response. That price bargaining can result in significant transfers from processors to producers when demand is inelastic and supply is uncontrolled is highlighted in the empirical application.

From <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> point of view, the major worry is the probability of the rejection of good lots P(x > c/p ≤ AQLp), which are false positives FP known as producer risk, a false alarm calling <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> to action where action is not necessary. <b>The</b> <b>producer</b> priority is to avoid the rejection of good lots, and, consequently, the sampling plan includes relatively large c.
