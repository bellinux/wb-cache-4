In the case of Mbata, the kingdom's origin as an alliance produced this power, exercised by the Nsaku Lau. In the seventeenth century, political maneuvering also caused some provinces, notably Soyo, but occasionally Mbamba, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> very long terms by the same person. Provincial governments still paid income to the crown and their rulers reported to the capital to give account.|$|E
25|$|President Quezon {{initiated}} women's suffrage in the Philippines {{during the}} Commonwealth Era. As {{a result of}} the prolonged debate between the proponents of women's suffrage and their opponents, the Constitution finally provided that the issue be resolved by the women themselves in a plebiscite. If no less than 300,000 of them were to affirmatively vote in favor of the grant within two years, it would be deemed granted the country's women. Complying with this mandate, the government ordered a plebiscite <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> the purpose on April 3, 1937.|$|E

Ten per cent of the residuary estate was to go to the Independent Board. The will was drawn in 1935, before the establishing of The Presbyterian Guardian and before the organization of the new Church. The gross estate was estimated at $175,000.|$|E

25|$|In the English {{civil war}} Samuel More fought for Parliament and {{commanded}} a garrison at Hopton Castle in Shropshire. Hopton Castle {{was one of}} the few castles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> Parliament in that county. Samuel More was commandant of the castle when, in 1644, it was besieged by a force of Cavaliers led by Sir Michael Woodhouse, with a force of about 500. Samuel More’s garrison numbered around 30 men, and the end result of such an action was inevitable. Without external support, More would be forced to surrender. It seems that Colonel Samuel More was offered quarter (the option of a surrender) twice and refused. After this accounts differ.|$|E
25|$|Because the new vice {{president}} is {{the former governor of}} Pennsylvania, a special election is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> his successor. Underwood helps Russo get clean and props up his candidacy, but later uses call girl Rachel Posner to break his sobriety and trigger his downfall shortly before the election. When Russo decides to come clean about his role in Underwood's schemes, Frank kills Russo and stages his death as a suicide. With the special election in chaos, Underwood convinces the {{vice president}} to step down and run for his old position of governor – leaving the vice presidency open to Underwood, as was his plan all along.|$|E

It would be the Wanderers' only championship in the league. The off-season would lead to changes in membership in the league, as Cobalt, Haileybury and Shamrocks dropped out. Les Canadiens would {{be taken over by}} new management and Quebec would join the league for the 1910-11 season. Lalonde was returned to the Canadiens.

25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of resulting trust, and is created when a trust is created, but the settlor does not give the form in which the property is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> <b>For</b> example, the settlor might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is {{to happen to the}} property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on resulting trust for the settlor, as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E
25|$|All {{over the}} country, the {{political}} parties had favoured the general elections in Pakistan {{with the exception of}} Muslim League. In 1954, the legislative elections were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> the Parliament. Unlike in West, not all of the Hindu population migrated to India, instead a large number of Hindu population was in fact presented in the state. The communist influence deepened and was finally realised in the elections. The United Front, Communist Party and the Awami League returned to power, inflicting a severe defeat to Muslim League. Out of 309, the Muslim League only won 10 seats, whereas the communist party had 4 seats of the ten contested. The communists working with other parties had secured 22 additional seats, totalling 26 seats. The right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami had completely failed in the elections.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{profits to}} {{complete}} the park, fair organizers knew {{they would have to}} maximize receipts. An estimated attendance of 70million people would be needed to turn a profit and, for attendance that large, the fair would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> two years. The World's Fair Corporation also decided to charge site-rental fees to all exhibitors who wished to construct pavilions on the grounds. This decision caused the fair to come into conflict with the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), as the international body headquartered in Paris that sanctions world's fairs: BIE rules stated that an international exposition could run for one six-month period only, and no rent could be charged to exhibitors. In addition, the rules allowed only one exposition in any given country within a 10-year period, and the Seattle World's Fair had already been sanctioned for 1962, as 2 years prior.|$|E

25|$|Cooksey {{made her}} {{international}} debut at the 1982 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where she placed 17th {{and helped the}} American women's team to fourth in the rankings. She missed {{the rest of the}} season due to a repeated stress fracture injury. After she recovered, she came second behind Gabriele Andersen at the California International Marathon in Sacramento and her time gained her qualification into the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Trial. The trial race was highly competitive as it came at a time of a burgeoning women's running scene in the United States and, as well as being on home soil, it was the first time the marathon was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> women at the Summer Olympics. Cooksey achieved a significant personal record time of 2:35:42 hours at the trial race in Olympia, Washington, but this was only enough for thirteenth place overall. Injuries yet again spoilt her 1985 and 1986 seasons, although she won the American 5K road title in the latter year.|$|E
25|$|There were no easily defended {{positions}} between El Agheila and Benghazi, {{the terrain}} being open and good tank country. Neame {{was ordered to}} conserve the tank units as far as possible, yet inflict losses on the Axis forces if they attacked, fight a delaying action as far as Benghazi if pressed and abandon the port if necessary. There was no prospect of reinforcement before May so the high ground of the escarpment nearby and the defiles to the north near Er Regima and Barce in the Jebel Akhdar, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> as long as possible. The 2nd Armoured Division would move inland south of the Jebel to Antelat and operate against the flank and rear of the Axis forces, when they moved up the Via Balbia or cut across the desert towards Mechili and Tobruk. The tanks would have to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili, Timimi, El Magrun and Benghazi {{as a substitute for}} lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier E. W. D. Vaughan) arrived at Martuba in late March, with all its transport but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets, to be ready to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili if the Axis attacked.|$|E
25|$|The 1930s were {{to herald}} {{a new era}} for the team as it emerged at times {{as one of the}} {{dominant}} sides in world rugby league. In 1930 and 1933 Wales played Australia at Wembley Stadium in London. On both occasions they failed to win, losing 26–10 and being thrashed 51–19. However at the time Australia were arguably considered the world's second best nation (behind England) and so particularly in the first game, Wales had done very well against the touring Kangaroos. Wales luck against England did not change either suffering three losses to the Lions in three games, in Huddersfield, Salford and Leeds. They were very unlucky in the latter however, with England winning 14 points to 13. Exactly 27 years after Wales played their first match, they played France {{for the first time in}} a new competition called the European Nations Cup, in which Wales, France and England would play two matches each. Wales and France kicked off the tournament on New Year's Day in front of 15,000 in Bordeaux. But the Dragons lost 18–11, and their match against England was just as bad losing 24–11 in Liverpool. The France versus England match finished a 15–15 draw so England won the inaugural competition on points difference. Wales finished bottom. The next European Nations Cup brought better fortunes to the Welsh and they kicked off the competition, which was staged across Winter 1935 and 1936, with a 41–7 thrashing against France. The team were cheered on by 25,000 people at Llanelli and three months later Wales did the unexpected and squeezed past England, winning 14–17 away at Hull. This was a huge result for Wales, having not beaten England since 1923, and they had won the cup for the first time. For the next two competitions Wales successfully defended the cup. A 3–2 win against the English in Pontypridd, coupled with a 9–3 victory in Paris saw Wales clinch the cup for the second time, and then in 1938 the Dragons beat England again by one point in Bradford before beating the French 18–2. This represents perhaps the highest point in Welsh rugby league history with great players such as Jim Sullivan, Gus Risman, Alan Edwards and Alec Givvons featuring. In 1935 Welsh rugby league would produce its first black international in George Bennett (some 48 years before Welsh rugby union would do so). In the 1938/1939 tournament, the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>for</b> six years because of the Second World War, Wales beat their main rivals England before dramatically losing 16–10 in Bordeaux against Les Tricolores. Because of the French's victory against England, Wales finished second and the cup was taken across the channel.|$|E
