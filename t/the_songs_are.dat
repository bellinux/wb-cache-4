5|$|Once {{you hear}} the song 'Fighting Temptation', and all the music in this film, you can't help but {{fall in love with}} it. You'll {{definitely}} get emotional. You might become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like.|$|E
5|$|As most of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> in {{the form}} of Ovee, Ranade decided to use the {{traditional}} musical format. He took help of Sarojini Babar, a Marathi writer-politician who had studied the songs of the period depicted in the film. Babar introduced Ranade to her sister, Kumud Pawar, who have made a collection of various traditional Ovee. For two situation songs, Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. <b>The</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that the}} album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>were</b> {{performed}} by professional musicians. Additionally, many of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>were</b> covers.|$|R

Starting to the Summer leg of the Inedito World Tour <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced.|$|R
5|$|Mustaine {{had said}} that {{thirteen}} songs had been written in the sessions for the album, though only twelve were originally contracted for the album (one of which being a bonus track intended only for the Japanese market). However, it was later revealed that the album was to feature a total of 13 tracks. Several of the songs on the album were previously recorded by the band {{in one form or}} another, although most of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> completely new material.|$|E
5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. <b>The</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> all but forgotten. While I {{have no regrets}} regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's {{subspecies}} Anthus petrosus littoralis {{in summer}} plumage is particularly close in outward appearance {{to the water}} pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hey Young Girl" [...] is {{the second}} single from Lloyd's first studio album Southside. <b>The</b> <b>song</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} by Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. <b>The</b> <b>song</b> <b>is</b> inspired by Slick Rick's [...] "Hey Young World", which <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>is</b> sampled from.|$|R

5|$|The album's lyrical {{themes are}} dark, {{focusing}} on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The {{rise of the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, {{media coverage of the}} 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, and various mass shootings influenced its writing. The band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent subject matter, and is inspired by artists such as Radiohead, Suicide, and Kendrick Lamar. As with previous Everything Everything work, most of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> presented as in-character narrations.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. <b>The</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|Thematically, Rebel Heart {{represents}} the singer's romantic and rebellious sides. The themes grew organically during the writing and recording sessions. Musically, it is a pop record which merges {{an array of}} genres such as 1990s house, trap, and reggae, {{as well as the}} use of acoustic guitars and gospel choir. Some of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> autobiographical in nature while others talk about love and Madonna's career. Rebel Heart features guest appearances by boxer Mike Tyson and rappers Nicki Minaj, Nas and Chance the Rapper.|$|E

5|$|Arjona's primary musical {{style is}} Latin pop. He usually sings {{without the help}} of {{featured}} or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden Déjame Decir Que Te Amo, on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums. On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> fairly even in tone and tempo.|$|E
5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. <b>The</b> <b>songs</b> <b>are</b> a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>song</b> <b>is</b> {{featured}} in <b>the</b> 2017 film [...] of Marvel Cinematic Universe.
