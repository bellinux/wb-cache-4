5|$|Tumbleweeds, {{which are}} the {{above-ground}} portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and has gained {{a reputation as a}} noxious weed. Fungi of the genus Bovista are known to use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|Confederate forces {{still at}} Columbus blocked the Union army's {{access to the}} lower Mississippi. Grant, and General James B. McPherson, {{came up with a}} plan to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and then ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and {{allowing}} the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander under the newly created Department of Missouri. Halleck was considering <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy,</b> but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed twice the number of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. After Foote's gunboats had silenced most of the guns at the fort, Grant's troops moved in and easily captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862.|$|E

25|$|Games {{in which}} players score highest when both players choose <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy,</b> {{such as the}} stag hunt and {{battle of the sexes}} are called {{coordination}} games. These games have reaction correspondences of the same shape as Figure 3, where there is one Nash equilibrium in the bottom left corner, another in the top right, and a mixing Nash somewhere along the diagonal between the other two.|$|E

25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).|$|E
25|$|Value and {{discount}} {{retailers have}} seen a boom in sales since the recession {{at the start of}} 2009. Although there are several retailers with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> as 99p Stores, such as independent businesses and smaller price-point retail chains such as Poundworld, 99p Stores' closest and largest rival in the sector is Poundland. The retailer has cited one of their main aims is to catch up with Poundland and their 223 stores as of August 2009. The retailer makes it a point of honour to undercut rival Poundland, whose £1 pack of 100 white plastic cups contained 20 fewer (and cost a penny more) than the pack of 120 available at 99p Stores as of late 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Monarchs had {{developed}} a strategy of marriages for their children in order to isolate their long-time enemy: France. The Spanish princes married the heirs of Portugal, England and the House of Habsburg. Following <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy,</b> the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Catalan-Aragonese house of Naples against Charles VIII of France in the Italian Wars beginning in 1494. As King of Aragon, Ferdinand {{had been involved in}} the struggle against France and Venice for control of Italy; these conflicts became the center of Ferdinand's foreign policy as king. In these battles, which established the supremacy of the Spanish Tercios in European battlefields, the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century.|$|E

25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy.</b> Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the game}} uses a white ball {{instead of the}} red one used in {{first-class}} cricket, the ball can become discoloured and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules {{to help keep the}} ball playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> that was used in the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.|$|E
500|$|Palace Software, the {{developer}} {{of the two}} Barbarian games, marketed the sequel with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> they used for the first game. [...] They hired Maria Whittaker, a model known for her topless work, to pose on the cover and posters as the princess in the game, attempting to recapture the controversy that had boosted sales. [...] Barbarian II received a mixed critical reception. [...] Reviewers were split in their opinions over whether the game was a refreshing and gory adventure, or a boring and lonely sojourn through a confusing digital world.|$|E

500|$|Sperner's lemma {{is a more}} {{advanced}} application of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy.</b> The lemma states that {{a certain kind of}} coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex that contains every color. Rather than directly construct such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such subsimplices through an induction argument. A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks down as [...] when one considers the two possible orientations of a simplex.|$|E
500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|Riel {{had counted}} on the Canadian {{government}} {{being unable to}} effectively respond to another uprising in the distant North-West Territories, thereby forcing them to accept political negotiation. This was essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> that had worked to such great effect during the 1870 rebellion. But in that instance, the first troops did not arrive until three months after Riel seized control. However, Riel had completely overlooked {{the significance of the}} [...] Canadian Pacific Railway. Despite some uncompleted gaps, the first Canadian regular and militia units, under the command of Major-General Frederick Dobson Middleton, arrived in Duck Lake less than two weeks after Riel had made his demands.|$|E

500|$|The Sega Mark III was {{released}} in Japan in October 1985 at a price of ¥15,000. Despite featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition, the Famicom, the Mark III did not prove to be successful at its launch. [...] Difficulties arose from Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers at the time, whereby Nintendo required that titles for the Famicom not be published on other consoles. [...] To overcome this, Sega developed its own titles and obtained the rights to port games from other developers, {{but they did not}} sell well. NEC later used <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>strategy</b> on some of Sega's titles when developing games for the TurboGrafx-16.
