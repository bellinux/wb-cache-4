So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.|$|E

However, there are many cases in which damage is caused without a clear understanding of where the pollutant source is located. There are three groups of identifying pollutant source information (Liu and Zhai, 2007) : the probability method, forward method, and backward method. In our previous study, we proposed reverse simulation, which is categorized as a backward method (Abe and Kato, 2011). Numerical instability by negative diffusion is a principal problem in the backward method. In order to improve the problem, we applied a low-pass filter operation to the concentration flux in the RANS analysis. The simulation secured the numerical stability.

This kind of study demands a high spatial resolution. In order to illustrate the influence of <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> <b>resolution</b> on tropospheric ozone levels, several simulations were carried out with MM 5 -EMICAT 2000 -CMAQ model using horizontal resolutions ranging from 8, 4 and 2 km and with 6 or 16 vertical layers during an episode of photochemical pollution (13 – 16 August 2000). High resolutions lead to improve discrete and categorical statistical parameters when evaluating the model against meteorological and air quality data. Results show that coarser grids tend to present a homogeneous and smoothened behaviour of wind flows. Also, results do not manage to describe the particularities of the circulations of the region.
