5000|$|Like their American contemporaries, the Communist {{government}} saw {{the circus}} as the people’s entertainment. [...] Officials considered the circus to be culturally {{on par with}} the Ballets Russes or Tchaikovsky, but was much more affordable, and therefore more proletarian, at only about five dollars per ticket. The Soyuzgoscirk established seventy circus buildings across the USSR, and entire towns would turn out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|R

500|$|The year 1926 {{was lacking}} in variety entertainment, a fact largely {{attributed}} to the UK general strike that had occurred in May of that year. The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star {{in a series of}} variety dates for Moss Empires. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of Bits and Pieces and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he was sure the audiences would embrace his new show. [...] However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song [...] "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" [...] and that he heavily edit the sketch [...] "The Cheat". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and Bits and Pieces enjoyed rave reviews. [...] It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension.|$|E

The eighth episode, which served as the mid-season finale {{as a result of the}} writers' strike, brought in 11 million, setting a new series low. [...] The next episode and midseason premiere climbed slightly to 12 million, but the episode after that set the current record for lowest-rated episode in the United States with 11 million people watching. The finale was seen by 12 million, reaching the most viewers since the midseason premiere and making it Lost lowest-rated finale yet. [...] Despite the decline in viewers, Lost consistently ranked within the top 20 programs of the week with one exception. [...] The finale topped the chart, due to its broadcast being over a week after the official end of the television season.

500|$|Disasterpieces was {{recorded}} at the now defunct London Dockland Arena in England on February 16, 2002, {{it was one}} of the final dates on the band's European tour which was subsequently their final tour until 2004. The concert was shot with 26 different cameras under the direction of Matthew Amos and documents the show, backstage action and an in-store signing in Paris, France. In addition to operated cameras each band member had an individual camera which was attached to the side of their masks, apart from Mick Thomson whose camera was attached to the headstock of his guitar. The concept behind these cameras was to allow the viewer <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> from the band member's point of view. However they did cause some discomfort and problems for some band members. Bassist Paul Gray removed his after four songs, explaining that [...] "they gave us this big [...] pack to wear around our waist. So when I was jumping around, the thing started sliding down my leg".

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} official synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Tom Wilk is a poor country lad, living alone with his stepfather, who ill-treats him. Tom leaves his work one day to follow a circus parade. He is fascinated with {{the wonders of the}} parade and follows it to the circus grounds, around which he stays all morning, and is finally tempted by his great wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> to crawl under the tent. He is discovered by a circus guard, and ordered off the ground. A small girl, Lillie Lockwood, and her father come to the circus, and witness Tom's ejection. Urged by his daughter, Lillie's father buys Tom a ticket of admission, giving him his first happy day. In return, Tom gives Lillie, as a keepsake, his most treasured possession, his pocket knife. On returning home, Tom is severely chastised by his step-father, after which he decides to run away. He walks to a neighboring town, and is there engaged as an office boy by Gates, a lawyer. After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares he had loved her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot {{is based on the}} fact that you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B−. He praised the acting, {{if not the}} writing: [...] "Kramer's {{non-specific}} glee and Jerry's passive frustration at it are both different tones for the characters, and it's fun <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> play with the archetypes they've already set up. Later on, after Jerry has cashed out with a loss but George hangs on to make a profit, George's incongruous happiness (replete with cigar, suit, and him daintily picking up the check) is equally amusing. But script-wise, it's again apparent that David and Seinfeld are pretty new {{to the concept of}} actually sketching out coherent plots... The whole thing kinda just moves along until it isn't moving along anymore. It's not unfunny, and there's some choice dialog, like Jerry and George having the first of many Superman conversations about whether he has super-humor powers." ...|$|E

After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue {{was a huge}} success; the song [...] "We don't want to lose you, but we {{think you ought to}} go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It was the first of many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E
