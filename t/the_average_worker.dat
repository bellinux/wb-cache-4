5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their barbless stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker.</b> Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E
25|$|Alaskan crab {{fishing is}} very dangerous, and the {{fatality}} rate among the fishermen is about 80 times the fatality rate of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker.</b> It is suggested that, on average, one crab fisherman dies weekly during the seasons.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the inauguration}} of the horse trams, horse buses had {{provided}} a limited public service, but road surfaces were poor and their carrying capacity was low. The new horse trams gave a smoother ride. The fares were too high for <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> so the horse trams saw little patronage; services began later than when workers began their day so were of little use to most. Running costs were high as the operator had to keep {{a large number of}} horses and could not offer low fares.|$|E
25|$|Overall Americans worked {{more than}} their {{counterparts}} in other developed post-industrial nations. While <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American only had 16 annual vacation days. In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average Czech. Overall the US labor force was the most productive in the world (overall, not by hour worked), largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding South Korea). Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.|$|E
25|$|Jersey Shore {{was once}} {{a major player in}} the {{railroad}} industry. The New York Central Railroad built a large rail car building operation within the boundaries of Jersey Shore in the late 19th century. What had formerly been a minor stop on the Pennsylvania Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed overnight into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works manufacturers of railroad valves, Jersey Shore Steel, the Susquehanna Silk Mill, and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company.|$|E

25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, {{it should come as no}} surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|E
500|$|Soldiers of the AIF {{were among}} the highest paid of the war. The pay for a private was set at five shillings a day, while an {{additional}} shilling was deferred to be paid on discharge. As a result, the AIF earned the sobriquet [...] "six bob a day tourists". Married men were required to allot two shillings a day for their dependents; however, a separation allowance was added in 1915. Reflecting the progressive nature of Australian industrial and social policy of the era, this rate of pay {{was intended to be}} equal to that of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> (after including rations and accommodation) and higher than that of soldiers in the Militia. In contrast, New Zealand soldiers received five shillings, while British infantrymen were initially only paid one shilling, although this was later increased to three. Junior officers in the AIF were also paid at a rate higher than those in the British Army, although senior officers were paid considerably less than their counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|After mating, a queen digs a nest chamber. About {{two days}} after her flight, she seals the nest chamber. [...] Conway found that many mated queens after digging and sealing nest {{chambers}} did not reappear later on, which could indicate a high mortality rate among newly mated queens. [...] Around {{five days after the}} flight, the queen lays eggs in clusters of 5–10. The larvae hatch around 20 days, and begin pupating in cocoons around 10 days after that. Adult workers emerge around 63 days after eggs are laid. Larvae are fed and cared for by the queen and workers. It is believed that the larvae may even be fed eggs and dead workers. The workers in the first brood tend to be smaller than workers in subsequent broods, which is believed to be an adaptation to promote rapid population growth. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> lives from 11 to 170 days.|$|E

2500|$|Jersey Shore {{was once}} {{a major player in}} the {{railroad}} industry. In 1901, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad announced it would build large rail car shops near Avis, [...] west of Jersey Shore, on the far side of Pine Creek. To induce workers and businesses to favor Jersey Shore over competing towns, entrepreneurs acquired land and built the Jersey Shore Electric Street Railway, a trolley line running from the city to the New York Central shops. In 1905, a second trolley line, the Jersey Shore and Antes Fort Railway, was put into service between the city and the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Antes Fort, [...] to the southeast. These two trolley lines changed Jersey Shore from a city with no railroad connection to a city with two. What had formerly been a minor stop on the West Branch Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>worker</b> in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works (a maker of railroad valves), the Susquehanna Silk Mill and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company.|$|E

Further, societal norms placed constraints on executive pay. This changed as union power declined (the share of unionized workers fell significantly during the Great Divergence, from over 30% to around 12%) and CEO pay skyrocketed (rising from around 40 times <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>workers</b> pay in <b>the</b> 1970s to over 350 times in the early 2000s).|$|R

For the aggregate economy, the real wage gap was about the same as the labour productivity gap, but again there were important sectoral differences. Compared to their productivity, German industrial workers were poorly paid, whereas German agricultural and service sector employees were overpaid. This affected the competitiveness of the two countries in these sectors. There were also important differences in comparative real wages by skill level, affecting the extent of poverty...|$|R
