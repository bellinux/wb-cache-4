We envision that both commercial and freely available affinity reagents, as well as published studies using these reagents, could include a MIAPAR-compliant document describing the product's properties with every available binding partner.

In this lecture I will use material mostly drawn from Mary-Claire van Leunen’s book, A Handbook for Scholars, although examples from the computer science literature will also be given. What is most important is that a set of rules for citation and reference is chosen and consistently used, so that the reader is not bothered with trying to understand the meaning of any inconsistencies.
