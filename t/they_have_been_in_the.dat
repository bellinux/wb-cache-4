He lives in South Park with his father Gerald, a lawyer, and his overprotective mother Sheila, a housewife who fits the mold of a Jewish mother stereotype. Gerald and Sheila have been referred to as Polish Jews, and they mutually share a strong devotion to their Jewish religion, while expressing deep concern during the multiple times Kyle's faith in Judaism becomes enervated. Kyle has a younger brother named Ike, who Kyle learns was adopted and originally from Canada in the episode Ike's Wee Wee.|$|E

25|$|From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test {{images have}} been in the public domain for many years in most countries, {{particularly}} those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets, where he also described the method of administering the test.|$|E

2500|$|On May 6, the Russian [...] advance began {{through the}} Tortum Valley towards Erzurum. The Ottoman 29th and 30th Divisions managed {{to stop this}} assault. The Ottoman X Corps counter-attacked the Russian forces. But on the {{southern}} part of this advance, Ottoman forces were not as successful as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. On May 11 the town of Manzikert had fallen. On May 17, Russian forces entered the town of Van. Ottoman forces continued to be pushed back. The region south of Lake Van was extremely vulnerable. The Turks had to defend a line of more than 600 kilometers with only 50,000 men and 130 pieces of artillery. They were clearly outnumbered by the Russians. The region was mountainous, thus difficult to defend.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 19th {{century the}} Regular U.S. Army was small, {{and the state}} militias {{provided}} {{the majority of the}} troops during the Mexican–American War, the start of the American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War. With the Militia Act of 1903, the militia was more organized and the name [...] "National Guard" [...] recommended. In 1933, the state National Guards were required to join the National Guard of the United States, a reserve force for the U.S. Army; this is the official founding of the present National Guard. In World War I, National Guard soldiers made up 40 percent of the U.S. combat divisions in France. In World War II, the National Guard made up 19 divisions. One hundred forty thousand Guardsmen were mobilized during the Korean War and over 63,000 for Operation Desert Storm. They have also participated in U.S. peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo as well as for natural disasters, strikes, riots and security for the Olympic Games when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> States.|$|E
2500|$|Sucrose {{gradient}} centrifugation [...] {{a linear}} concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based density gradient media, like Percoll) is generated in a tube {{such that the}} highest concentration is {{on the bottom and}} lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. [...] During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). [...] The problem with this is that the useful separation range of within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. [...] Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of interest will go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further. [...] However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. [...] A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal field. [...] Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as [...] "rate zonal" [...] centrifugations. [...] After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected.|$|E

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E
