The new prime minister was Gough Whitlam and new postmaster-general was Doug McClelland. In early 1973, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> more independent organisation, Madgwick asked Whitlam if the ABC's employees could {{be removed from the}} Public Service Board, which administered the Commonwealth government employment system. Although Whitlam had supported the idea in the past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did not act on Madgwick's request.|$|E
5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} Crown and nationalism, helping <b>to</b> <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> sense of national identity at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks.|$|E

The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag is to be found in the Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} a {{continuing}} misrepresentation, lying by omission occurs when an important fact is left out in order <b>to</b> <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> misconception.

25|$|The CRTC also regulates which {{channels}} broadcast distributors must or may offer.

The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market, preventing it from upholding its responsibility <b>to</b> <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> national conversation. Some people, however, consider this tantamount to censorship.|$|E

25|$|As the Laotian Civil War flared from 1961 onward, the CIA {{carried out}} a {{paramilitary}} program designed <b>to</b> <b>foster</b> <b>a</b> guerrilla army to support the Royal Lao Government (RLG).

The Annamese Cordillera in southern Laos became the haven for a communist logistics network, the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The communist war effort in South Vietnam depended on that supply route.|$|E
