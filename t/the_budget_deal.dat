2500|$|Residents {{did become}} angry, however, when D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray {{announced}} {{a plan in}} June 2012 to build a temporary parking lot on the ground of the Crummell School to accommodate 65 intercity passenger buses while a bus terminal near Union Station was being rebuilt. Area activists claimed {{they had not been}} consulted before the plan was announced, and they objected to the noise, exhaust fumes, and traffic that they said would plague their neighborhood. When Michael Durso, a staff member {{in the office of the}} Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, met with residents in September 2012, he was verbally assaulted by Ivy City residents. When Mayor Gray declined to reconsider the plan, the citizens sued in D.C. Superior Court. The Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy argued that Gray's action occurred because Ward 5 council member Harry Thomas, Jr. had recently gone to prison and his successor, Kenyan McDuffie, had only been in office a few months. At trial, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Victor L. Hoskins admitted that the city did not know what environmental or health laws or regulations it had to meet to relocate the bus parking, and that the cost of the temporary parking lot had never been estimated. Durso testified that at least six sites were considered for the bus parking lot, but only the Ivy City site had the proper zoning, access, and space. D.C. Superior Court Judge Judith N. Macaluso, however, ruled on December 10 that the city had [...] "deliberately disregarded" [...] its own laws requiring local neighborhood consultation and that the city had [...] "evaded environmental screening by mischaracterizing the project" [...] on zoning and business occupancy documents. The injunction was temporary, however, and a series of court hearings occurred over the next two years as the city fought to build the parking lot at the Crummell School. In an attempt to stop the parking lot relocation, Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh and Ward 5's Kenyan Duffie worked to secure $1.925 million ($ in [...] dollars) in the city's 2015 budget to fund a community center at the Crummell School. [...] <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deal</b> also included $7 million ($ in [...] dollars) to renovate the structure in 2016. The court lifted its injunction in March 2014, after it found that the city was able to justify construction of the bus parking lot at the Crummell School under city and federal health and environmental laws. On April 1, 2014, Gray was defeated in the Democratic primary by D.C. City Council member Muriel Bowser, who went on to win the general election on November 5, 2014. On July 30, 2015, Mayor Bowser announced an end to the city's attempt to put a bus parking lot at the Crummell School. Instead, the city would disperse the buses to parking lots at Buzzard Point, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and at curbside spaces around town.|$|E

40|$|Why did the United States (US) lift its forty-year old oil {{export ban}} in 2015 ? Press {{coverage}} has offered various answers, {{such as the}} decline in crude oil prices {{and the rise of}} US tight oil production. Yet, these explanations are incomplete. Prices have declined in the past without a policy change and, in spite of the shale revolution, the US remains a net oil importer. Here, we argue that the repeal of the ban was driven by the confluence of multiple streams in the policy process: a policy problem created by the spread between US and international crude prices, a policy solution advocated by a constituency with growing voice and power, and a window of opportunity offered by falling international oil prices and <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deal</b> in late 2015.
