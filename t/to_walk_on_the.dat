5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether {{for the opportunity to}} command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{made his}} second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third {{successful}} lunar landing mission.

He became the fifth and, {{at the age of}} 47, the oldest man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.|$|E

5|$|When {{the pier}} opened on 5 June 1867, again under Cecil Hugh Smyth Pigott, {{many of the}} people of Weston-super-Mare were given a holiday and a banquet was held in the Town Hall. The toll <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pier was 1d (an old penny), but this was quickly raised to 2d, which was the maximum fee {{permitted}} by the General Pier and Harbour Act 1861. 120,000 people paid the toll in the first three months. A tramway system was installed to carry the luggage of passengers arriving at the pier.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E

The theme not only {{sets the tone for}} the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E

5|$|Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and {{the first}} person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon. He was also an {{aerospace}} engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was {{an officer in the}} U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin, who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{designated}} as {{the commander of the}} first manned Project Gemini mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to Ménière's disease, an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission, piloting the Apollo Lunar Module Antares to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions. At age 47, he became the fifth and oldest person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface. He was Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the United States Navy and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank.|$|E

25|$|Purdue offers both {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs in over 211 major areas of study, and {{is well known for}} its competitive engineering curricula. The university has also been highly influential in America's history of aviation, having established the first college credit offered in flight training, the first four-year bachelor's degree in aviation, and the first university airport (Purdue University Airport). Purdue's aviation technology and aeronautical engineering programs remain among the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world. In the mid-20th century, Purdue's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced spaceflight technology giving rise to Purdue's nickname, Cradle of Astronauts. Twenty-three Purdue graduates have gone on to become astronauts, including Gus Grissom (one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts), Neil Armstrong (the first person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon), and Eugene Cernan (the last person <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon).|$|E
