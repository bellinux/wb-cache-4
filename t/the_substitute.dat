40|$|A {{series of}} 1, 4 -bis(2 -substituted- 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole) benzene {{derivatives}} {{has been designed}} to explore their optical, electronic, and charge transport properties for luminescent and charge transport materials. The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) analysis have turned out that the vertical electronic transitions of absorption and emission are characterized as intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Both λabs and λfl of the derivatives with 2 -thiophene and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments show bathochromic shifts compared with parent compound 2 -pyridyl substituted derivative (1), while the corresponding values of <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, and phenyl fragments {{are similar to those of}} parent compound 1. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, phenyl, 2 -thiophene, and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments are expected to be promising candidates for luminescent materials for OLEDs. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, phenyl, and 2 -thiophene fragments can be used as promising electron transport materials, while <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> derivatives with 2 -pyrazine and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments can be used as promising hole transport materials. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> derivative with 2 -pyrazine fragment may be used as good candidate for ambipolar charge transport material for OLEDs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBy {{using the}} method of Fourier {{transform}} ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, substituent stabilization energies of homologous series of cycloalkyl carbanions, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with π-accepting substituents (X = Ph, CN, COOMe, NO 2) have been determined experimentally in the gas phase as {{the difference between the}} proton affinity of <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> and corresponding unsubstituted (X = H) cycloalkyl carbanions. The stabilization energy data have been analyzed in terms of Taft's parametrization of polarizability, field/inductive, and resonance effects. The linear regression analyses show excellent correlations within the XCH− 2, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7), and X-c-C 3 H− 4 carbanion series, from which it appears that the contributions of polarizability effects are independent of the above type of carbanions and only depend {{on the nature of the}} substitutuent. Further, it follows that inductive stabilization is more effective in <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> methyl, XCH− 2, than in <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> cycloalkyl, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7) carbanions. This result suggests that inductive stabilization is counteracted by the electron releasing effect of alkyl groups. Resonance stabilization is significantly more effective in <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> cycloalkyl, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7), than in <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> methyl, XCH 2 −, carbanions, which suggests that in contrast to inductive stabilization, resonance stabilization is assisted by the electron releasing effect of alkyl groups. Finally, it appears that substituent stabilization in <b>the</b> geometrically restricted <b>substituted</b> cyclopropyl carbanions, X-c-C 3 H 4 −, is dramatically less effective than in the corresponding geometrically unrestricted larger substituted cycloalkyl carbanions, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7). The linear regression analyses of <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> cycloalkyl carbanions indicate that reduction of the stabilization energy is caused not exclusively by a geometrically hindered resonance stabilization, but also to a smaller extent by a less efficient inductive stabilization in <b>the</b> <b>substituted</b> cyclopropyl carbanions...|$|R

Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives.
