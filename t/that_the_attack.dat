5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges, but there was no indication <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was successful.|$|E
5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal had {{recommended}} Hindawi to Syrian intelligence. Seale {{writes that the}} bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the Allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. Bertram had thus succeeded in all its objectives. Announcing the victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were [...] "hateful violence" [...] and {{denounced the}} crime. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were not {{representative}} of Sweden. and that [...] "no-one in Sweden should be afraid of practicing their religion".|$|R
2500|$|Palestinian {{historian}} Abbas Shiblak believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> {{were committed}} by Zionist activists and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were <b>the</b> pre-eminent {{reason for the}} subsequent exodus of Iraqi Jews to Israel. Shiblak also argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were an attempt to sour Iraq-American relations, saying [...] "The March 1951 <b>attack</b> on <b>the</b> US Information Centre was probably an attempt to portray the Iraqis as anti-American and to gain more support for the Zionist cause in the United States".|$|R
5000|$|Kazakhstan's {{president}} Nursultan Nazarbayev declared 9 June {{a national}} day of mourning. He also noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> occurred on <b>the</b> eve of Ramadan and claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were ordered from abroad. He also suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were {{an attempt to}} start a [...] "colour revolution" [...] in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev also called for harsher criminal penalties on Kazakhs who joined militant groups, tighter security at gun shops and military installations and for stricter migration control.|$|R
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi assumed a more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Maatan as-Sarrah {{was only the}} first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E
5|$|In a {{television}} report taped and broadcast {{shortly after the}} bombing, Tuđman said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> {{appears to have been}} meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia, and as a decapitation strike. He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation. Marković telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević for the attack. He demanded his resignation, threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijević was out of office. The Yugoslav Defence Ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was not authorized by the central command and suggesting that the event might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted plastic explosives in the Banski dvori.|$|E

5|$|In {{the palace}} garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is {{protected}} from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, {{but as they}} touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain {{with the city of}} Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Jerusalem will begin the next day.|$|E
5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2017, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine. This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> {{was not meant to}} generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E
50|$|Between 15 June and 17 June 2014, {{more than}} 60 {{people were killed}} in attacks in and near Mpeketoni, Kenya. The Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility, but the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta {{asserted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were organized by local politicians with ties to a network of gangs. Correspondents from <b>the</b> area suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> may have been motivated by ethnic or religious hatred, or revenge for land grabbing.|$|R
5000|$|Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, has {{repeatedly}} demanded {{an end to}} the strikes, stating: [...] "The use of drones is not only a continual violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve and efforts at eliminating terrorism from our country". The Peshawar High Court has ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> are illegal, inhumane, violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and constitute a war crime. The Obama administration disagreed, contending <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> did not violate international law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method of <b>attack</b> was precise and effective.|$|R

5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, {{and would have been}} deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian {{artillery}} battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Brigade {{embarked}} for the Western Front on 17 June 1916. Its first {{battle was}} the disastrous Battle of Fromelles. Despite his inexperience in trench warfare, {{he pointed out}} to Major H. C. L. Howard of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's British Expeditionary Force staff that the width of no-man's land was too great for the assault to succeed. Major Howard agreed and, on returning to Haig's Chateau, attempted to persuade him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was doomed to fail. But the commander-in-chief decided that the operation must go on, so Elliott did all that was possible {{to make it a}} success by himself going to the front line to personally inspect the lie of the land and encourage his men. He soon realised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> had been a complete failure, reported to that effect, and established that he was now organising the defence of the original trenches. In the end, 1,804 of the 5,533 Australian casualties were from the 15th Brigade. For his part, Elliott was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Russian Order of St Anna (3rd class, with swords).|$|E
50|$|The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> {{were carried}} out by Pakistan based terror group Lashkar-e-Tayiba.|$|R
5000|$|VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were {{perpetrated by}} [...] "agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof".|$|R

5|$|The {{attack was}} universally {{condemned}} by Australian servicemen, who commonly believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Centaur {{had been carried}} out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status. Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having to talk a sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory bombing run on a Japanese hospital ship known {{to be in their}} area.|$|E
5|$|The {{projected}} {{attack on}} Aouzou never took place, as {{the dimensions of}} the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on the Libyan base was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter. Wagner {{died of a}} heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E
50|$|Between 15 June and 17 June 2014, {{more than}} 60 {{people were killed}} in attacks in and near Mpeketoni, Lamu County.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>attack</b> {{followed}} {{a series of}} terrorist incidents earlier in the month, including a suicide attack in Lahore. Pakistani authorities alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were orchestrated by jihadists in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Investigative Committee stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosives used in both explosions were identical and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> were therefore linked.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building, meeting Stjepan Mesić, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Ante Marković, then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, but none of them were injured in the attack. In {{immediate}} aftermath, Tuđman remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia. Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević, who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia. The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace, which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje. The Banski dvori sustained significant damage, but repairs started only in 1995. The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{fighting}} in Italy as part of the British Eighth Army with the 5th Brigade poised to attack across the Sangro River in central Italy. On his arrival, Kippenberger conducted a survey of the terrain and recommended to Freyberg <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> plan be modified to include an additional brigade, a recommendation Freyberg concurred with. The reorganised attack was successfully executed on the evening of 28 November with light casualties. The 2nd Division then attempted three times to capture the town of Orsogna. The second attack on the town of 7 December was the first to involve the 5th Brigade. Despite Kippenberger's brigade achieving all its objectives on the flank of the town, the attack was not successful. The failure of another brigade, tasked with capture of Orsogna itself, to achieve its goals left elements of the 5th Brigade exposed, and it had to partially withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Confederate forces {{still at}} Columbus blocked the Union army's {{access to the}} lower Mississippi. Grant, and General James B. McPherson, {{came up with a}} plan to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and then ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and {{allowing}} the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander under the newly created Department of Missouri. Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed twice the number of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. After Foote's gunboats had silenced most of the guns at the fort, Grant's troops moved in and easily captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>The</b> <b>attacks</b> {{were also}} {{condemned}} by the State Department of the United States, which issued {{a press release}} stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> [...] "demonstrate <b>the</b> Assad regime’s disregard for human life." ...|$|R
