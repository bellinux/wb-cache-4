5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> the crowd below and {{fell onto the}} pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz, {{inside his}} robot, traps Perry, {{offering}} him a deli platter thinking he has won; Perry, however, has him pour {{a large amount}} of pepper onto it, blowing it and causing the robot to sneeze. The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Waterproof {{mattress}} pads {{are used}} {{in some cases to}} ease clean-up of bedwetting incidents, however they only protect <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> the sheets, bedding or sleeping partner may be soiled.|$|E
50|$|Mats and carpets are {{typically}} spread {{along the length}} of the floor of <b>the</b> liwan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> cushions along <b>the</b> length of the walls make up the diwan or divan seating area.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> feather-beds were softer and higher, and the {{supports}} (fulcra) of them {{lower in}} proportion, than in older triclinium couches. The cloths and pillows spread over them, and over beds, were called accubitalia.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} the search-party started, Mr Humphreys and the guide leading the way; the men followed, one {{carrying}} five shovels; another, the basket and jar; the other two, three hurdles on which were placed <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> blankets.|$|R
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short moment and then went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the penis}} inside the woman's vagina, the man {{can control the}} force, depth, pace, and rhythm of thrusts, and can also control to some extent the female partner's {{movements}}. Subject to the man's weight and position, the woman may have some control by pushing her feet and legs against <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> by side movements in her pelvis {{as well as by}} clutching onto and moving with her partner. [...] A woman can increase the force of a man's thrust by moving against the man's rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|Money {{claimed that}} media {{response}} to the exposé was due to right-wing media bias and [...] "the antifeminist movement". He claimed his detractors believed [...] "masculinity and femininity are built into the genes so women should get back to <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> the kitchen". However, intersex activists also criticized Money, stating that the unreported failure had led to the surgical reassignment of thousands of infants {{as a matter of}} policy. Privately, Money was mortified by the case, colleagues said, and as a rule did not discuss it. Money's own views also developed and changed over the years.|$|E
30|$|The {{last part}} is relaxation. All the pupils {{lay down on}} <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> close their eyes. One {{psychology}} teacher told a relaxing story with light music. The purpose of this section was to make both children’s physical and mental state restored to normal.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{his turn}} indeed to be utterly bewildered. He searched--none too gently--the squalid little lodge through and through, turned the paltry sticks of {{furniture}} over, hauled little Amelie, Grosjean's granddaughter, out of bed, searched under <b>the</b> <b>mattresses,</b> <b>and</b> even poked his head up the chimney.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, {{the under}} sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and tuck it clear down under <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> nice <b>and</b> smooth,--so,--do you see?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{a rating of}} 7/10, Ben Detrick of Spin stated that [...] "Lloyd Banks' hunger is not born of starvation, but of an insatiable appetite. On his third solo effort, the G-Unit rapper is a {{connoisseur}} of cars, women, and guns, spinning tight spider webs of syllables that are often so patterned that they obscure individual strands. [...] "Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a running start," [...] Banks growls on [...] "Payback," [...] a sinister track with mentor 50 Cent and a woozy, almost dubstep bass line. But he loves the ladies {{almost as much as}} barking threats. On [...] "So Forgetful," [...] an apology to past conquests, Banks muses about [...] "wet spots on <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> champagne splashes" [...] atop producer Ryan Leslie's 8-bit Atari synths." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today was also positive about the album, giving the album 3/4 stars and citing that [...] "the G-Unit rapper seeks to rekindle the spark of his critically acclaimed 2004 platinum debut by recalling both the title and the potent street vibe. Banks enlists several like-minded rappers — Pusha T, Styles P, Juelz Santana and Raekwon— who complement his own grittiness. The same goes for R stars Akon and Lloyd as he relies mainly on his signature jaw-breaking punch lines while eschewing a rash of poppish hooks. Banks is well served by his refusal to compromise just for airplay. His Hunger should whet his fans' appetites for even more." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went to the}} door. Dr. Seward {{was resting}} on <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> seeing me, he sprang to his feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} on the edge of <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> for all reply went on {{laughing}} in the same frightful and improbable tone.|$|E
60|$|Now they {{perceived}} {{that she was}} a true Princess, because she had felt the pea through <b>the</b> twenty <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> twenty eider-down quilts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, now, the {{under-sheet}} {{you must}} bring over the bolster--so, and tuck it right down under <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> nice <b>and</b> smooth--so. Do you see?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{we shall}} soon find that!' thought the old Queen. But she said nothing, {{and went into}} the sleeping-room, took off all the bed-clothes, and laid a pea {{on the bottom of the}} bed. Then she put twenty {{mattresses}} on top of the pea, and twenty eider-down quilts on the top of <b>the</b> <b>mattresses.</b> <b>And</b> this was <b>the</b> bed in which the Princess was to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Now the men hesitated no longer. Springing forward, {{several of}} them seized <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> began to lift it bodily. Mrs. Dove rose and tried to {{struggle}} from the bed, then uttered a low moaning cry, fell back, and lay still.|$|E
60|$|KITTY: And Mary Shortall {{that was}} in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> we all subscribed for the funeral.|$|E
60|$|They {{took up the}} old archer, {{and carried}} him between them into his house, where he had dwelt alone. And there they laid him on the floor, out of regard for <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> sought, as best they might, to {{straighten}} and compose his limbs.|$|E
60|$|Then Thurid {{laid her}} arms round his neck, and besought {{him not to}} burn the {{furnishings}} of the bed, and so much did she press him in this that his heart gave way to her, and she managed it so that Thorodd burned <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> pillows, while she took for herself the quilt and coverlets and all the hangings. Yet neither of them was well pleased.|$|R
50|$|Bedding {{underlay}} (or mattress overlay) is a thick, extra {{layer of}} padding between <b>the</b> bed <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> bedding. Underlays {{are designed to}} increase comfort and support, while extending the life of <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> (or mattress protector). Common underlay materials include: Wool, foam, and latex.|$|R
5000|$|As in many {{previous}} jailings of Civil Rights prisoners, they enthusiastically sang Freedom Songs, mostly direct {{descendants of}} slave spirituals. They made up songs {{to fit their}} new place. The prisoners sang these songs almost non-stop. They tell us that this singing nourished their sense of unity, purpose and spirits. Guard Tyson and the other white guards found the singing irritating, and tried to stop it. He {{said that it was}} bothering the cooks. Considering that the cooks were all black, {{it was clear that the}} effect on the cooks would be to make them [...] "uppity..." [...] He ordered the removal of <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> bug screens to force the prisoners to stop singing. Next, the guards tried to barter with the activists. The superintendent finally apologized to the riders, and returned their belongings, as well as <b>the</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> screens. It was notable that this negotiation occurred just hours before an inspection tour by a delegation of officials from Minnesota who were examining the treatment of the Freedom Riders. It was a welcome victory for the Freedom Riders.|$|R
60|$|But the {{prisoner}} had relapsed into his old attitude, and was surveying the jailor {{with the same}} abstracted air as before. That individual resumed his seat on <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> now lent his ear to a colloquy {{which seemed to be}} progressing {{at the foot of the}} stairs. Presently he was bailed by his brother turnkey from below.|$|E
60|$|Half {{a minute}} later Bill cut open <b>the</b> <b>{{mattress}}</b> <b>and</b> began to search through the stuffing, while I struck matches and watched 'im. It wasn't a big mattress and there wasn't much stuffing, but we couldn't seem to see that money. Bill went all over it ag'in and ag'in, and then 'e stood {{up and looked at}} me and caught 'is breath painful.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not look}} at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face. She cast one glance at the {{prostrate}} man and followed Emily. In a short time they returned with <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> Alan and Emily carried the sailor on it to Four Winds. Lynde walked behind them, seemingly unconscious of both. She watched the stranger's face as one fascinated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, we'll put <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> back <b>and</b> {{then make}} up the bed as nicely as possible," [...] said Randy, who, of course, in a joke of this sort {{directed}} operations.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the board}} {{can then be}} lifted (with <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> on it), <b>and</b> put on the stretcher.|$|R
50|$|An Ottoman bed (in the UK) {{is a type}} {{of storage}} bed in which the storage area is placed {{underneath}} <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> base <b>and</b> accessed by lifting <b>the</b> hinged <b>mattress</b> frame with <b>the</b> help of a spring or hydraulic mechanism.|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} of that last little bit was 'orrible. Fust {{of all we}} 'ad got to get <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> then in some way we 'ad {{got to get rid}} o' Jimmy. Bill's idea was for me to take 'im ashore with me and tell 'im that Bill would join us arterwards, and then lose 'im; but I said that till I'd got my share I couldn't bear to lose sight o' Bill's honest face for 'alf a second.|$|E
6000|$|... "I a game--I----!" [...] {{answered}} George, {{an expression}} of the deepest pain spreading itself over his ugly features. [...] "No, marm--and when one hev wanted to help a friend too. Well, if you think that--and no doubt misfortune hev made you doubtful-like--the best I can do is to bid you good-day, and to wish you well out of your troubles, workhus and all, marm, which I do according," [...] and he rose from his box with much dignity, politely bowed to the hag on <b>the</b> <b>mattress,</b> <b>and</b> then turning walked towards the door.|$|E
60|$|The decrying {{of those}} idol-priests contributed {{not a little}} to the {{destruction}} of idolatry through all that coast. The life which Xavier led, contributed full as much. His food was the same with that of the poorest people, rice and water. His sleep was but three hours at the most, and that in a fisher's cabin on the ground: for he had soon made away with <b>the</b> <b>mattress</b> <b>and</b> coverlet, which the viceroy had sent him from Goa. The remainder of the night he passed with God, or with his neighbour.|$|E
50|$|The {{hotel is}} located on the top (5th) floor of the {{building}} which was once the grand ballroom of The Rubens at the Palace next door to the hotel and opened in 2000. It is the smallest of London's five star hotels with 30 deluxe rooms and is noted for its classical furnishing and strong mahogany. All of the rooms are furnished in black and white fabrics with traditional mahogany furniture <b>and</b> Egyptian-cotton linens. <b>The</b> <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> feather duvets are handmade. The bathrooms have a separate bath and shower.|$|R
60|$|It {{took the}} best part of three hours to put the room back into shape. Some ink had been spilled on one of <b>the</b> <b>mattresses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> glass over one of the {{photographs}} had been broken, but that was all the real damage that had been done, and it looked to be accidental. The wad of paper in the keyhole was picked out piece-meal by means of a big fishhook. The key was in the heap on the floor, having been flung through the open transom after the door was locked and plugged.|$|R
50|$|Eugene McCarthy was in <b>the</b> {{manufacture}} of <b>mattresses</b> <b>and</b> bedding supplies by 1884. He was located at 106 South Clinton Street.|$|R
