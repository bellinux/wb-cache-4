5|$|During {{the early}} nineteenth century <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was a vital conduit of British trade, {{connecting}} Britain with its colonies and trading posts in the Far East. Convoys of merchant ships, including the large East Indiamen, sailed from ports in China, South East Asia and the new colony of Botany Bay in Australia, as well as Portuguese colonies in the Pacific Ocean. Entering <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> they joined the large convoys of ships from British India that carried millions of pounds of trade goods to Britain every year. Together these ships crossed <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and rounded the Cape of Good Hope, sailing north until eventually reaching European waters. Docking at one of the principal British ports, the ships unloaded their goods and took on cargo for the return journey. This often consisted of military reinforcements for the Army of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), whose holdings in India were constantly expanding at the expense of neighbouring states.|$|E

40|$|Anomalous east-west {{asymmetric}} anomalies {{were seen}} in sea surface temperature (SST), and convective activity over <b>the</b> equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> during October-December 1997. Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and sea surface height data obtained from TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter, its triggering process and strengthening mechanism are identified. The climatological wind over <b>the</b> equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> exhibits different seasonal cycle between its western and eastern region. During the summer monsoon season, westerly wind prevails over <b>the</b> western <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, easterly wind is dominant over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> at almost <b>the</b> same time. During the 1997 summer, divergent easterly wind anomalies were obvious over <b>the</b> equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> due to a warm episode of the El Nino, which weakened (accelerated) the climatological westerly (easterly) wind over <b>the</b> western (eastern) <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> As a result, the east-west SST contrast was produced in the succeeding autumn through changing evaporative cooling and upwelling. Corresponding to these SST changes, the convective activities were enhanced (suppressed) over <b>the</b> western (eastern) <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and actual wind became easterly in place of climatological westerly wind during October-December 1997...|$|R

5|$|The French Navy played little part in {{opposing}} the British campaign in Egypt, but a frigate {{was sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{to interfere with the}} supply lines to the Red Sea. This ship, Chiffone was based at Mahé in the Seychelles. The voyage had been eventful, Chiffone seizing a Brazilian frigate Andhorina in the Atlantic and the East Indiaman Bellona, as well as conveying 32 political prisoners sentenced to exile in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> At the Battle of Mahé on 19 August however, Chiffone was discovered at anchor by Sybille and captured. The final operations in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> saw British forces consolidate further, landing troops at the Portuguese colonies in the region to prevent the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Badajoz, under which Portugal agreed to exclude British shipping from its ports, while the EIC attacked and captured the Dutch island of Ternate.|$|E
40|$|The interannual {{variability}} of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in <b>the</b> tropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> is dominated mainly by a basin-scale mode (BM) and partly by an east– west contrast mode (zonal mode, ZM). The BM reflects the basin-scale warming or cooling and is {{highly correlated with}} El Nino with 3 - to 6 -month lags, while the ZM is marginally correlated with El Nino with 9 -month lags. During an El Nino, large-scale anomalous subsidence over the maritime continent {{occurs as a result}} of an eastward shift in the rising branch of the Walker circulation suppresses convection over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> allowing more solar radiation over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the anomalous southeasterly wind over <b>the</b> equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> forces <b>the</b> thermocline over <b>the</b> western <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> to deepen, especially in the southern part. As a result, SST over the whole basin increases. As El Nino decays, the subsidence over the maritime continent ceases and so does the anomalous southeasterly wind. However, the thermocline perturbation does not quickly shoal back to normal because of inertia and it disperses as Rossby waves. These Rossby waves are reflected back as an equatorial Kelvin wave, caus-ing deepening of the thermocline in <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and preventing SSTs from cooling in that region. Moreover, the weaker wind speed of the monsoon circulation results in less latent heat loss, and thus warms <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> These two processes therefore help to main-tain warm SSTs over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> until fall. During the fall, the warm SST over <b>the</b> eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and <b>the</b> cold SST over <b>the</b> western <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> are enhanced by air–sea interaction and the ZM returns. The ZM dissipates through the seasonal reversal of the monsoon atmospheric circulation and the boundary-reflected Kelvin wave. In the same manner, a basin-scale cooling in <b>the</b> trop-ical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> can induce <b>the</b> ZM warming in the west and cooling in the east. 1...|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, <b>the</b> Subtropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole mode {{develops}} in December-January, peaks in February, then decays {{in the following}} two months, and finally dies down in May-June.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies have shown that <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{arrived at}} Rio de Janeiro around 14–18 August. It then passed the Cape of Good Hope. From here, rather than passing through <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the Straits of Malacca, the fleet sailed south of Western Australia and through Bass Strait.

5|$|After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December, Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic, {{intending}} to pass into <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope {{in anticipation of}} the arrival of the British China Fleet. The China Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits, across <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean, arriving in British waters six to eight months after departure. During the passage, the convoy gathered ships from the various British colonies in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and by the time it passed the southern tip of Africa it often contained dozens of vessels. By combining the heavy armaments of the East Indiamen with a strong Royal Navy escort, the China Fleet became a formidable target for French raiding squadrons: at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804, an unescorted China Fleet drove off a powerful French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois after a sharp encounter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> recent <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Experiment (INDOEX) {{observed}} high aerosol concentrations with {{a sizeable}} soot fraction over <b>the</b> northern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> This aerosol mix substantially absorbs solar radiation, and recent modeling studies {{have proposed that}} the resulting atmospheric heating reduces daytime cloud cover. The present study tests this hypothesis by investigating whether low-level cloud cover has decreased over <b>the</b> northern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> between 1952 and 1996, a time period when south Asian anthropogenic emissions have greatly increased. The observed slight increase in cloud cover indicates that other processes must compensate soot solar heating. A similar increase in cloud cover observed over the relatively clean southern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> suggests <b>the</b> increase over <b>the</b> northern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{does not have a}} special regional anthropogenic aerosol origin...|$|R

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that {{followed}} them, British dominance in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was repeatedly {{challenged by the}} depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of Réunion (later Île Bonaparte) and Île de France. Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with letters of marque giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to the enemies of France. French naval strategy in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques François Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade in <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.|$|E
