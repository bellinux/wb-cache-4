5|$|The Vajpayee {{government}} {{ordered the}} Indian {{armed forces to}} expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War. Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on <b>Terror,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of better addressing India's issues with terrorism and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations {{for the sale of}} weapons.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and {{occupied}} Yugoslavia. Montenegro {{was captured by}} the Germans, who soon withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy it. The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from Kosovo and Vojvodina, the influx of refugees {{from other parts of}} Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in Kosovo and a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, and the economic damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the temporary removal of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked {{a turning point in}} Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{large-scale}} operations {{proved to}} have little permanent effect on the guerrilla groups themselves, the reprisals instilled sufficient <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local population to deter cooperation with the guerrillas. Furthermore, in late 1943, pressed by both the Germans and rival leftist ELAS guerrillas, General Napoleon Zervas, the leader of EDES, the dominant guerrilla group in Epirus, reached a tacit agreement with Lanz and restricted his forces' operations against the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Slate Magazines Julia Turner compares Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to the War on <b>Terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{context of}} the fight against Osama bin Laden saying Voldemort takes up {{terrorism}} by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying Fred and George Weasley's shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new Minister of Magic jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.

The killing of innocent civilians and destroying their properties couldn't be justified by any standard. I am of the view that a democratic unity {{on the basis of}} justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E

25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of war is not a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. The first aim of these mass rapes is to instill <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civilian population, {{with the intent to}} forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second aim is to reduce the likelihood of return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. The use of mass rape is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return.|$|E
25|$|German {{occupational}} authorities further {{attempted to}} instill <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population of western Macedonia by deploying the collaborationist Poulos Verband and Jagdkommando Schubert, headed by Georgios Poulos and Friedrich Schubert respectively. These units were stationed in Krya Vrysi and Asvestochori, creating a protective axis around Thessaloniki, while Thessaloniki itself was garrisoned by the collaborationist government's Security Battalions. Schubert's previous imprisonment by the Germans, who condemned his ruthlessness and employment of former convicts during his deployment in Crete, was now disregarded, as all available forces were {{required for the}} Axis counter insurgency campaign. The pressure from the ELAS attacks around Thessaloniki threatened the ongoing German evacuation of southern Greece; Army Group E {{came to the conclusion}} that a show of force was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Brown did {{not plan}} to have a sudden raid and escape to the mountains. Rather, he {{intended}} to use those rifles and pikes he captured at the arsenal, {{in addition to those}} he brought along, to arm rebellious slaves with the aim of striking <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slaveholders in Virginia. He believed that on the first night of action, 200-500 black slaves would join his line. He ridiculed the militia and regular army that might oppose him. He planned to send agents to nearby plantations, rallying the slaves. He planned to hold Harpers Ferry for a short time, expecting that as many volunteers, white and black, would join him as would form against him. He would move rapidly southward, sending out armed bands along the way. They would free more slaves, obtain food, horses and hostages, and destroy slaveholders' morale. Brown planned to follow the Appalachian Mountains south into Tennessee and even Alabama, the heart of the South, making forays into the plains on either side.|$|E

25|$|According to Amnesty International, {{the use of}} rape {{during times}} of war is not a {{by-product}} of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In {{the last quarter of}} a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during the conflicts in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and the DRC. The strategic aim of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill <b>terror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return.|$|E
