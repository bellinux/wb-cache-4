5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> so common on this night.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Baith Israel {{merged with}} Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing {{congregation}} <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> {{too large for}} the row house in which it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by the publishers, it was not serialised in a popular magazine, as originally intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{his private}} studies, Holmboe {{attended}} lectures given by SÃ¸ren Rasmusen. In 1815 he {{was appointed to the}} position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others. In his teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E

5|$|In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in {{partnership}} with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive breeding programme. In 2012, the red-billed choughs were living free in the central valley area of Durrell Wildlife Park, and the Trust expects colonisation of the coastal areas of Jersey in the following years.|$|E

Romney then became co-president of a mission <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> demoralized and disorganized after the May 1968 general strike and student uprisings and the car accident. With Romney rallying the others, the mission met its goal of 200baptisms for the year, the most in a decade. By the end of his stint in December 1968, he was overseeing the work of 175others. As a result of his experience there, Romney developed a lifelong affection for France and its people and has also remained fluent in French.|$|E
5|$|Keseberg {{brought a}} {{defamation}} suit against {{several members of}} the relief party who accused him of murdering Tamsen Donner. The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the California Star described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party, reporting that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing Keseberg he concluded that no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to be innocent.|$|E

5|$|Meretzky {{conceived}} Hodj 'n' Podj in {{the late}} 1980s, {{as a way to}} revive simpler games <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> hard to obtain. It began production in 1994, and was the first product developed by Meretzky's company Boffo Games. Production was troubled, thanks to a $100 million securities fraud scandal at Media Vision, which led to the project's sale to Virgin. During development, Boffo discovered that Hodj 'n' Podj appealed to a wider demographic than Meretzky's past work, and Meretzky has since cited it as an early casual game.|$|E
5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E
5|$|The PSP remake's {{localization}} {{was similar}} to those done for Persona 3 and 4, with the dialogue being in tune with modern youth and keeping {{as close to the}} original dialogue as possible except for Japan-specific cultural references. To provide a reference for their work, the localization team played through the original version of Persona. The changes made to character names and appearances were all changed back to how they appeared in the original Japanese release, {{with the exception of a}} couple of lines <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> fan favorites. These were included as a kind of homage to both players and the company's history of game localization. The entire Snow Queen quest was also reinstated.|$|E

5|$|The Wiz {{proved to}} be a {{commercial}} failure, as the $24million production only earned $13.6million at the box office. Though prerelease television broadcast rights had been sold to CBS for over $10million, in the end, the film produced a net loss of $10.4million for Motown and Universal. At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made. The film's failure steered Hollywood studios away from producing the all-black film projects <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> popular during the blaxploitation era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.|$|E
5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E
