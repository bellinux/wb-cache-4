40|$|Although a {{positive}} male marriage premium {{has been found}} in many studies, the source of the premium is unclear and debated – does it result from selection or specialization?

30|$|Our {{analysis}} is {{also related to}} the literature on <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> market <b>penalties</b> of low physical attractiveness.

While negative effects of own BMI on both labor- and marriage-market outcomes have been well-documented (e.g., Averett et al. 2008; Cawley 2004; Garcia and Quintana-Domeque 2007), our evidence indicates that the relative BMI within the couple reinforces these penalties through the household decision process. Relatively heavier married individuals work more hours to compensate their spouses for their defect, regardless of gender. More generally, this study contributes to the understanding of labor supply of married men and women. The estimated sizeable correlations of relative BMI and spouses hours of work, and with opposite signs, are all the more remarkable given the acknowledged rigidities in hours worked.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the tax-transfer treatment of married couples in 15 EU countries using the EUROMOD microsimulation model. First, we show that many tax-transfer schemes in Europe feature negative jointness defined as a situation where the tax rate on one person depends negatively on the earnings of the spouse. This stands in contrast to the previous literature on this question, which has focused on a specific form of positive jointness. The presence of negative jointness is driven by family-based and means-tested transfer programs combined with tax systems that usually feature very little jointness. Second, we consider the labor supply distortion on secondary earners relative to primary earners implied by the current tax-transfer systems, and study the welfare effects of small reforms that change the relative taxation of spouses. By adopting a small-reform methodology, it is possible to set out a simple analysis based on more realistic labor supply models than those considered in the existing literature. We present microsimulations showing that simple revenue-neutral reforms that lower the tax burden on secondary earners are associated with substantial welfare gains in most countries. Finally, we consider the tax-transfer implications of <b>marriage</b> and estimate <b>the</b> so-called <b>marriage</b> <b>penalty.</b> For most countries, we find large <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of the distribution driven primarily by features of the transfer system. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{offers a}} brief {{examination of the}} key policy issues surrounding <b>the</b> EITC and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties.</b> <b>The</b> EITC is designed to support low income working families with children. It provides a subsidy (up to $ 3, 816 in 1999) for families with children and low earnings. Current {{research shows that the}} EITC has been successful in raising the income of such families, increasing rewards/incentives to work among many low skill workers, and in stimulating greater work effort by single parents. 2 A less well understood feature of the EITC is its impacts on <b>marriage</b> incentives. <b>The</b> EITC can generate sizable marriage bonuses for some couples and <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> for others precisely because it is targeted on low-income families with children. Those with no children or no earnings qualify for little or nothing. And because benefits are phased out as family income rises, those with children and high earnings also get little or nothing. Thus it creates marriage rewards for couples where a non-working mother is considering marriage to a working man without children. "Her " children and "his " earnings allow them to qualify for the EITC when neither would qualify otherwise. Conversely, when a single parent is already working and qualifying for <b>the</b> full EITC, <b>marriage</b> to another worker will usually result in an EITC penalty...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{issues in}} family demography {{and the role}} of public policy in shaping life course transitions including educational attainment, marriage, and family formation. The first two chapters focus on the Earned Income Tax Credit, one of the largest cash transfer programs in the United States. Chapter one analyzes the impact of the EITC on the educational attainment of youth from low socioeconomic status families. Variation in state EITC policies is used to analyze the impact of increased household income on children's educational attainment. Results suggest that a $ 1, 000 increase in state EITC generosity increases college enrollment among 18 - 23 year olds by 1 percentage point and increases college enrollment by 0. 3 of a percentage point, a 10 % increase in college completion among this group. Chapter two analyzes <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>penalties</b> associated with <b>the</b> EITC. First, I simulate a marriage market to predict the earnings of potential spouses and how a spouse's earnings impact EITC benefits. Multinomial regression models are then used to assess how an expected loss in EITC benefits upon marriage affects one's likelihood of marrying or cohabiting. Results suggest that approximately 65 % of EITC recipients can expect to lose some of their EITC benefits upon <b>marriage.</b> <b>The</b> average EITC recipient can expect to lose approximately half of her EITC benefit, or about $ 1, 050. A $ 1, 000 expected loss in EITC benefits upon marriage is associated with a 1. 8 percentage point decline in the likelihood of marrying, and a 1. 1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of cohabiting. Chapter three (co-authored with Kelly Musick) examines variation in family formation among college graduates. We explore differences in the rates of childlessness among college-educated women across academic disciplines and examine potential mechanisms that may account for such differences. We find that women who major in health-related fields have the lowest levels of childlessness at around 16 % by age 44, while women who major in the arts and humanities have the highest rates of childlessness, at 25 %. We find that these differences are correlated with differences in early marriage patterns among women in these fields, as well as traditional gender role attitudes. ] 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|The tax regimes {{applied to}} couples in many {{countries}} including the US, France, and Germany imply either a <b>marriage</b> <b>penalty</b> or a <b>marriage</b> bonus. We study how they affect the decision to get married by considering two potential spouses who play a marriage proposal game. At {{the end of the}} game they may get married, live together without formal marriage, or split up. In this signaling game, proposing (or getting married) is costly but can indicate strong love. The striking property we obtain is that a marriage bonus may actually reduce the probability that a couple gets married. If the bonus is sufficiently large, the signaling mechanism breaks down, and only a pooling equilibrium in which fewer couples get married remains. Similarly, a <b>marriage</b> <b>penalty</b> may increase <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> probability.
