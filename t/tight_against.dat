25|$|The drain induced barrier {{lowering}} of the threshold voltage and channel length modulation effects upon I-V curves are reduced by using shallow junction extensions. In addition, halo doping can be used, that is, {{the addition of}} very thin heavily doped regions of the same doping type as the body <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> the junction walls to limit the extent of depletion regions.|$|E
500|$|The Isobarik, {{like the}} Sara and Kan that were {{developed}} in the 1970s and 80s, was designed to work best near room boundaries. Manufacturer's leaflets advise positioning of the speaker close to a rear wall and approximately [...] from corners. The trade-off is the less than solid stereo image. Linn declared forthrightly that loudspeakers that were not designed to work <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> a wall were without merit. According to Art Dudley of Stereophile, Linn also maintained provocatively that [...] "anyone who would design, manufacture, buy, sell, or positively review a loudspeaker made to be installed away from room boundaries was a fool".|$|E

2500|$|These 1795–1820 fashions {{were quite}} {{different}} from the styles prevalent during most of the 18th century {{and the rest of the}} 19th century, when women's clothes were generally <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> the torso from the natural waist upwards, and heavily full-skirted below (often inflated by means of hoop skirts, crinolines, panniers, bustles, etc.). The high waistline of 1795–1820 styles took attention away from the natural waist, so that there was then no point to the tight [...] "wasp-waist" [...] corseting often considered fashionable during other periods. Without the corset, chemise dresses displayed the long line of the body, as well as the curves of the female torso.|$|E
2500|$|The {{green heron}} is {{relatively}} small; adult body length is about [...] The neck is often pulled in <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> the body. Adults have a glossy, greenish-black cap, a greenish back and wings that are grey-black grading into green or blue, a chestnut {{neck with a}} white line down the front, grey underparts and short yellow legs. The bill is dark with a long, sharp point. Female adults tend to be smaller than males, and have duller and lighter plumage, particularly in the breeding season. Juveniles are duller, with the head sides, neck and underparts streaked brown and white, tan-splotched back and wing coverts, and greenish-yellow legs and bill. Hatchlings are covered in down feathers, light grey above, and white on the belly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next day}} Federer came out <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> German Tommy Haas and was {{virtually}} buried being down 0–2 in sets and 30–40 at 3–4 {{in the third}} set. Federer then hit an inside-out forehand {{on the line to}} save the break point and went on the complete a miraculous 5 set comeback 6–7(4–7), 5–7, 6–4, 6–0, 6–2. After dismissing Gael Monfils in the quarterfinals, Federer faced rising star Juan Martin del Potro in the semifinals. Federer again in trouble, losing two of the first three sets, before again bearing down to come through in another five set thriller 3–6, 7–6(7–2), 2–6, 6–1, 6–4. [...] With this victory Federer reached his fourth consecutive final in Paris and first against someone other than Nadal. Söderling had backed up his momentous victory over Nadal with wins over Nikolay Davydenko and Fernando Gonzalez to meet Federer in the final.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the ROC curve is the detection error tradeoff (DET) graph, which plots the false negative rate (missed detections) vs. the false positive rate (false alarms) on non-linearly transformed x- and y-axes. The transformation function is the quantile function of the normal distribution, i.e., the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution. It is, in fact, the same transformation as zROC, below, except that the complement of the hit rate, the miss rate or false negative rate, is used. This alternative spends more graph area on the region of interest. Most of the ROC area is of little interest; one primarily cares about the region <b>tight</b> <b>against</b> the y-axis and the top left corner – which, because of using miss rate instead of its complement, the hit rate, is the lower left corner in a DET plot. Furthermore, DET graphs have the useful property of linearity and a linear threshold behavior for normal distributions. The DET plot is used extensively in the automatic speaker recognition community, where the name DET was first used. The analysis of the ROC performance in graphs with this warping of the axes was used by psychologists in perception studies halfway through the 20th century, where this was dubbed [...] "double probability paper".|$|E

Skin's skin had a greyish tone and, because of the extra amount, gave him the appearance of a melted candle.

However, performing these two stunts together caused him to have migraines and he soon gave up on the idea of being normal.|$|R
