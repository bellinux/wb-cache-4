5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E

5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two {{seats in the}} House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E

As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.|$|E

The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality is similar to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel; his primary change was to accept {{that he would like}} to have a wife.|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} Queen Mary 2, {{the designers}} aimed {{to reduce the}} ship's {{impact on the environment}} by improving fuel efficiency and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> older ships, as well as international standards on waste.|$|E
5|$|The report {{calculated}} the costs at 8.7 million kronor which corresponds in today's money to around $70 million (as of 2011), spent over a total construction schedule of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably lower than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> {{of the recently}} built or modernised fortifications on the continent; Belgium had spent the equivalent of 62 million kronor on the fortified positions of Liège and Namur along the Meuse while Romania had spent 63 million kronor to strengthen the defence of Bucharest and 16 million kronor on fortifications along the Siret River. In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Riksdagin line with the plans of the Fortification Committeethat construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while the question on Boden would be postponed to the next year. The plan gained support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, but when put to a joint vote of both chambers, the proposition passed. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, it was considered a great success for that question as well. During {{the last years of}} the century, the Riksdag's general attitude towards the army became more positive, most likely due to the increased Russification of Finland, increased tension in the Union between Sweden and Norway, and rumors that the Russian sawfilers that worked in Sweden also worked for the Okhrana, the secret Russian police.|$|E
5|$|The stylised lily, or fleur-de-lis (lily flower) {{has long}} been {{associated}} with royalty, although it may originally have been derived from {{the form of an}} iris. It has also been associated with the head of a spear. Its three parts have been associated with the three classes of mediaeval society, or alternatively faith, wisdom and chivalry. Whatever its exact derivation, it has come to be associated with France and the French monarchy since the earliest Frankish kings. Consequently, it became incorporated into not only French heraldry but also <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic French influence, such as Quebec and New Orleans. In modern times it appears in many forms, symbolic and decorative, and can be used on compasses to indicate the direction north, as well as the Scouting movement.|$|E

There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two semi-vowels. The presence of a glottal stop is debatable; the glottal stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the number}} of young people {{entering}} a university has more than tripled in Germany, but university attendance is still lower than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> other European nations.

Many jobs which do require an academic degree in other countries (such as nursing) require completed vocational training instead in Germany.|$|E
