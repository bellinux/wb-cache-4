5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that spontaneous eye movements occur when visuospatial information is recalled from memory. Such gazes closely reflect the content and spatial relations from <b>the</b> original scene <b>layout</b> (e. g., Johansson et al., 2012). However, when someone has originally read a scene description, <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text itself might compete with <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> described scene. The present {{study was designed to}} address this fundamental issue by having participants readscene descriptions that where manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text itself. 28 participants read and recalled three texts: (1) a scene description congruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text; (2) a scene description incongruent with <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text; and (3) a control text without any spatial scene content. Recollection was performed orally while gazing at a blank screen. Results demonstrate that participant’s gaze patterns during recall more closely reflect <b>the</b> spatial <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene than <b>the</b> physical locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text.
