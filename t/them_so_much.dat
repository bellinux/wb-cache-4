5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used to dislodge fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines who responded with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E

25|$|Thuggees {{who were}} known for murdering and robbing {{travellers}} in caravans, had started around the 17th century and had reached significant proportions {{by the time}} the British established themselves in India.

In 1835, the British colonialists established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department to address the issue, with William Sleeman as its first Superintendent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} few years of Chavez's office, his newly created social {{programs}} required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On February 5, 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only offering <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of a foreign currency. The Chávez administration also enacted agricultural measures that caused food imports to rise dramatically, and such agricultural mainstays, such as beef, rice, and milk, slowing in domestic production. With Venezuela's reliance on imports and its lack of having dollars to pay for such imports, shortages resulted.|$|E

In addition, they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and therefore have to join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it, and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E

The video for the song was shot on inexpensive Super 8 film during the two-week filiming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album (2007). Critics have noted that Beyoncé emulates Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot and Barbra Streisand throughout the clip. During an interview with MTV on a [...] "Beyoncé: Behind the B'Day Music Videos", MTV commented on Beyoncé's appearance in the music video stating that she acts like [...] "a goofball" [...] and [...] "it also feels like {{we get to see}} the real [...]" [...] Beyoncé replied, [...] "I'm way different in my everyday life.

500|$|John Williams {{composed}} the score for Raiders of the Lost Ark, {{which was the}} only score in the series performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, the same orchestra that performed the scores for the Star Wars saga. The score most notably features the well-known [...] "Raiders March". This piece came to symbolize Indiana Jones and was later used in the scores for the other three films. Williams originally wrote two different candidates for Jones's theme, but Spielberg enjoyed <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he insisted that both be used together in what became the [...] "Raiders March". The alternately eerie and apocalyptic theme for the Ark of the Covenant is also heard frequently in the score, with a more romantic melody representing Marion and, more broadly, her relationship with Jones. The score as a whole received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, but lost to the score to Chariots of Fire composed by Vangelis.|$|E
500|$|NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, {{priced at}} C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, {{arriving}} in December. They replaced the Adams. Irvine liked <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that, {{in one of}} his final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the [...]476 round being too potent. The first batch was stamped NWMP-CANADA (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or double-action, and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn spindle arms would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn pivot pins could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between [...] diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.|$|E
500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} {{such a thing as a}} [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help." ...|$|E

Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular at that time. I think they did the Warped tour because they wanted to get popular again." [...] He also went on to call Warning [...] "probably their worst album, I think. It's what happens, the ups and downs." [...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that it didn't matter.
