40|$|The wear of {{star wheel}} teeth is an {{importance}} {{issue in the}} single screw compressor. In order to enhance the wearresistance of star wheel teeth, some new profiles of the meshing pair were proposed to replace the currently used straight line envelope profile, such as single column envelope, multi-straight line (or multi-column) envelope. In this paper, a curved surface of the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> is suggested. The groove flank is the envelope surface corresponding to the curved surface of the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank.</b> Section profile of the new <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> is a curved line, which could be elliptical, hyperbolic or involute.

40|$|Abstract The <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> of {{bevel gears}} with {{involute}} teeth are still cut using approximations such as Tredgoldâ€™s and octoid curves, while {{the geometry of}} the exact spherical involute is well known. The modeling of the <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> of gears with skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of gears with skew axes and involute teeth is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on the geometry of the <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> of gears with skew axes. The dualization of the tooth profiles of spherical cycloidal gears leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line. A main result reported herein is Theorem 5, which is original. All results are proven by means of a consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and rigid-body twists...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of linear tip profile {{modification}} on the stress of tooth root and <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> of involute spur gears. An increase in the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> stress due to the tip profile modification is potentially hazardous because there is an increased risk of micro pitting initiation. The required magnitude of tip relief profile modification depends on the magnitude of tooth elastic deformation that needs to be compensated for. In order to study the effects of linear tip profile modification on gear stress, two matching finite element models of involute spur gear pairs have been created, and tip relief profile modification has been applied to one pair. Tooth root and <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> stresses in both gear pairs have been compared in order to establish the effect of tip relief profile modification on gear stress...|$|E

In this report, <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> temperature of plastic gears is measured in detail by usig a radiation pyrometer and the results are obtained as follows: 1.

Cooling effect of teeth by rotation is affected by gear operating position (driver or follower) and combination of gear materials. 4.

In this report, the influence of <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> form deviation on transmission error is further investigated by using this model.

40|$|All normal {{lines of}} a helical {{developable}} Î¦ have the same distance to its axis a and make the same angle with a. This implies that on coaxial one-sheet hyperboloids of revolution or skew ruled helical surfaces with generators included in the normal-congruence of Î¦ any orthogonal trajectory of the rulings is located on a translate of Î¦. Let line n be the normal of the helical developable Î¦ at C. When Î¦ performs a helical motion or rotation about its axis a with constant velocity, then the point C of intersection with the fixed normal line n runs along n with constant velocity, too.

The complex stress condition on the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> is illustrated. On the flank occurs a three dimensional stress condition with a rotating principal stress system. Furthermore the influences of residual stresses and from the contact of technical rough surfaces on this stress condition are discussed.
