40|$|Accumulation of {{tetracycline}} in Escherichia coli was {{studied to}} determine its permeation pathway {{and to provide a}} basis for understanding efflux-mediated resistance. Passage of tetracycline across the outer membrane appeared to occur preferentially via the porin OmpF, with tetracycline in its magnesium-bound form. Rapid efflux of magnesium-chelated tetracycline from the periplasm was observed. In E. coli cells that do not contain exogenous tetracycline resistance genes, the steady-state level of tetracycline accumulation was decreased when porins were absent or when the fraction of Mg(2 +) -chelated tetracycline was small. This is best explained by assuming the presence of a low-level endogenous active efflux system that bypasses the outer membrane barrier. When influx of tetracycline is slowed, this efflux is able to reduce the accumulation of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. In contrast, we found no evidence of a special outer membrane bypass mechanism for high-level efflux via the <b>Tet</b> <b>protein,</b> which is an inner membrane efflux pump coded for by exogenous tetA genes. Fractionation and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation experiments showed that the <b>Tet</b> <b>protein</b> is not localized to regions of inner and outer membrane adhesion. Furthermore, a high concentration of tetracycline was found in the compartment that rapidly equilibrated with the medium, most probably the periplasm, of Tet-containing E. coli cells, and the level of tetracycline accumulation in Tet-containing cells was not diminished by the mutational loss of the OmpF porin.

Here, we demonstrate that TET proteins are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications that mostly occur at these regulatory regions.

The O-linked GlcNAc transferase, which we identified as a strong interactor with all three TET proteins, catalyzes the addition of a GlcNAc group to serine and threonine residues of TET proteins and thereby decreases both the number of phosphorylation sites and site occupancy. Interestingly, the different TET proteins display unique post-translational modification patterns, and some modifications occur in distinct combinations. In summary, our results provide a novel potential mechanism for <b>TET</b> <b>protein</b> regulation based on a dynamic interplay of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation at the N terminus and the low-complexity insert region.

We first detected the expression of the TET family, consisting of TET 1, TET 2 and TET 3, in bovine MII stage oocytes and found that TET 3 is more highly expressed than TET 1 and TET 2. Treatment with 1 mM DMOG increased 5 mC levels (30. 4 % vs 79. 8 % at the 8 -cell stage for satellite I, 25. 3 % vs 40. 6 % at the 8 -cell stage for α-satellite, 20. 5 % vs 73. 5 % at the blastocyst stage for satellite I and 16. 6 % vs 30. 0 % at the blastocyst stage for α-satellite) at every bovine parthenogenetic embryo developmental stage. At the same time, DNA methylation level of satellite DNA and pluripotency gene promoters increased significantly. Real-time PCR analysis results indicated that the transcription levels of NANOG and OCT- 4 decreased in the DMOG-treated group. Furthermore, TET inhibition negatively affected blastocyst formation, resulting in a decline in the blastocyst rate (17. 1 ± 1. 3 % vs 24. 1 ± 0. 6 %); however, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased according to the results of a TUNEL assay.

Such 5 hmC modifications are known to be prevalent in DNA of embryonic stem cells and in the brain, but the distribution of 5 hmC in the majority of embryonic and adult tissues has not been rigorously explored. Here, we describe an immunohistochemical detection method for 5 hmC and the application of this technique to study the distribution of 5 hmC in a large set of mouse and human tissues. We found that 5 hmC was abundant in the majority of embryonic and adult tissues. Additionally, the level of 5 hmC closely tracked with the differentiation state of cells in hierarchically organized tissues. The highest 5 hmC levels were observed in terminally differentiated cells, while less differentiated tissue stem/progenitor cell compartments had very low 5 hmC levels. Furthermore, 5 hmC levels were profoundly reduced in carcinoma of the prostate, breast and colon compared to normal tissues. Our findings suggest a distinct role for 5 hmC in tissue differentiation, and provide evidence for its large-scale loss in cancers...|$|E
30|$|Neuro 2 a is a mouse neural crest-derived {{cell line}} {{that has been}} widely used as an {{experimental}} model for neuronal differentiation study. In our previous studies, we used this model to study the role of srGAP 3 in neuronal differentiation, and we found srGAP 3 negatively regulated valproic acid (VPA)-induced neuronal differentiation of Neuro 2 a cells (Chen et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2013). In this study, we investigated the role of <b>TET</b> <b>proteins</b> during neuronal differentiation using Neuro 2 a cells as a model. We found that all three <b>TET</b> <b>proteins</b> could negatively regulate neuronal differentiation of Neuro 2 a cells. Furthermore, TET 1 can negatively modulate neuronal differentiation independent of its catalytic activity and through srGAP 3.|$|R
40|$|Promoter CpG island hypermethylation is {{a common}} {{strategy}} for cancer cells to silence tumor-suppressor gene expression, thereby facilitating the initiation and progression of cancer. Many cancers acquire a so-called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple aberrantly hypermethylated gene promoters. Mechanisms underlying CIMP have generated a considerable interest in the recent years. Common in many tumors with CIMP is the deregulation of 5 mC-directed DNA hydroxylase activity provided by <b>TET</b> <b>proteins.</b> Colon cancers with an activating BRAFV 600 E mutation display extensive CGI hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of many genes, including <b>TET</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, the causal link between BRAFV 600 E, <b>TET</b> <b>proteins</b> regulation and DNA hypermethylation has not been established. We show here stably expressing BRAFV 600 E in colon cancer cell line that BRAFV 600 E at first regulates the expression of TET 1 independent of its own promoter methylation. The downregulation of TET 1 is enough to establish hypermethylation at several CIMP targets. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of BRAFV 600 E is able to reverse the hypermethylation phenotype. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, a direct functional link between BRAF signaling and TET 1 action and shows that TET 1 downregulation is required for BRAF-induced DNA hypermethylation in colon cancer...|$|R
