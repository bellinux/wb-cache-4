6000|$|... "No, no, only just. I {{ought to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Miss Ladd is strict about--sweethearts. Are you quite sure," [...] Francine inquired jocosely, [...] "that {{you can answer}} for yourself, in that particular?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because you'll {{have to know}} a {{good many}} things that it <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> it <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{the stage of the}} river--tells you whether there's more water or less in the river along here than there was last trip.' ...|$|R

50|$|Pepé finds Penelope {{hiding in}} the Air Conditioning machine and traps her in it with himself. Pepé's fumes spread through the Louvre spoiling various works of art, the cartoon ending with the fumes causing the Mona Lisa to talk ("I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> chaps <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> It's {{not always easy to}} hold this smile.").|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} will, or I won't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> single <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> {{must understand}} this: I'm {{not asking you}} to change yourself. Just want you to know what they think. You must do that, no matter how absurd their prejudices are, if you're going to handle them. Is it your ambition to make this a better town, or isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't like to say, Captain Marshall. But I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> you are {{wanted on}} {{board of the}} Stormy Petrel at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess there's a {{beach at}} Sydney," [...] {{returned}} the captain; [...] "and I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Mr. Herrick--I don't mean to try. No, sir! Sydney {{will never see}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment, Mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "before you go will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at least; was it M. de St. Genis himself {{who accused}} me of treachery?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if {{the scheme}} be not wicked? Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> or two <b>things,</b> Miss Lovel;--or rather my own private opinion {{on one or}} two points. I do not believe that these two ladies are swindlers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{says that}} no man {{has ever had}} a truer friend. He will swear to that in all companies. And I, when it was allowed to me to swear with him, swore it too.

25|$|I will, however, <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{about the}} war, my first story and my last. I {{was asked by}} some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "if {{the time}} ever comes {{when we all}} storm those houses, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>one</b> <b>thing?</b> Tell me how we shall do it without authority? <b>Tell</b> me how <b>you</b> will have an army of revolt without discipline?" ...|$|R
60|$|HECTOR. Heaven's {{threatening}} growl {{of disgust}} at us useless futile creatures. [Fiercely]. I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>one</b> of two <b>things</b> must happen.

6000|$|... "My dear, I am a dunce, and I don't deny it. But let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> I haven't lived {{all my life}} in the West Indies, {{among black}} servants, without {{learning}} something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not wise?" [...] said she, her countenance scornful. [...] "You {{mean that}} I may {{see more than}} was {{intended}} for me. What game do you play here, sir, that <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and show me by your actions that you desire another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on there, Larry." [...] For {{the first}} time Daylight's voice was sharp, while all the old lines of cruelty in his face stood forth.

6000|$|Jimmy {{did as he}} was bidden, {{though there}} was a {{significant}} gleam in his eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps it's your due that I should <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> because I feel that I must.

That kind of thing gets hold of some of us. I feel I have to go. Secondly, there seems to be gold up there. I want the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a dandy," [...] was Jim's judgment, {{after his}} first mouthful. [...] "But I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> straight. I'm never goin' to visit you on that Arizona ranch, so you needn't ask me." ...|$|E

50|$|The school, {{originally}} a one room school building {{topped by a}} wood shingled bell tower, was opened to serve the growing population which included dairy farmers, cattle ranchers, and fruit growers.

6000|$|And Elizabeth {{left the}} room to take off her bonnet, and to visit the nursery, where the {{children}} were in bed.
