500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed {{to go through what}} I needed to go through to write the record <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> write. [...] These songs are really natural — they’re from not worrying about what happened or what’s going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers.

[...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people}} who are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country.

500|$|The title story, [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set {{in early}} 19th century Gloucestershire and {{concerns}} the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though {{the events of the}} story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, [...] "For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in...the novel...I decided there was no place for them...I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity...it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This meant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel." [...] Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the collection and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations". In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons, Victoria Hoyle writes that [...] "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural {{and in the course of}} things." ...|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier if you do not share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E

All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} and I have to say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well.

Sound the Alarm was named {{after one of the}} songs on the album that Conley said, [...] "sums up the mood of the record". Describing the album's theme, Conley said it was [...] "desolation, like you're the last person standing after the apocalypse and you're alone and you're cold.

It must also be acknowledged, as Chinmoy Guha showed in his book Where the Dreams Cross: T S Eliot and French Poetry (Macmillan, 2011), that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valéry. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B.

2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E

The character, after marrying Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), took on his surname, and became Karen McDonald. Described as [...] "a bulldog in hoop earrings" [...] and a [...] "Victoria Beckham wannabe", the role garnered Jones public attention, with episodes involving feuds between her and rival Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) receiving millions of viewers; the episode featuring Karen and Steve's (second) wedding, ruined by Tracy Barlow's revelation that her daughter Amy Barlow was Steve's love child, received 16.3 million viewers. Jones also began modelling for men's magazines such as FHM and Loaded, saying: [...] "I was 21, and within three weeks of me joining Corrie I was in Barbados doing a bikini shoot [...] I was quite impressionable and I'd just say yes to everything because I wanted to keep my job.

2500|$|All of {{the songs}} that would feature on Wishful Thinking were written during the summer with {{almost all of them}} {{credited}} to Neck Deep. [...] "Crushing Grief (No Remedy)" [...] was credited to the band and Seb Barlow. Ben Barlow considered [...] "inspiration" [...] the hardest part of making the album due to him being [...] "super happy". Whereas for the band's EP releases Barlow [...] "had some shit going on <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get off my chest". The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released. Rock Sound contributor Rob Sayce noted that the album was influenced by All Time Low's Nothing Personal (2009). Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'" [...] "Losing Teeth" [...] is about how Barlow and his friends were pursuing careers that would take them away from their hometown. Barlow said it wasn't [...] "about the end of our youth, as such, but definitely the end of us being kids, and reflecting on that." [...] "Growing Pains" [...] was the band's first attempt at [...] "diversity we have tried to implement", according to Thorpe-Evans. Thorpe-Evans mentioned that the group felt the song [...] "has a flair of originality and uniqueness" [...] when compared to the previous output.

2500|$|Under the {{pressure}} of matching [...] "Call Me Maybe"'s success, Jepsen recorded an entire indie-folk album during her run on Cinderella {{as an act of}} [...] "rebellion". The effort was scrapped as Jepsen felt like it was developed for the wrong reasons: [...] "I think there is a natural rebellion when you have success in one area to completely rebel against <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get that out of my system, I think. I made really weird music." [...] Her work on the musical provided valuable perspective in terms of being defined by a singular song, particularly from her costar Fran Drescher: [...] "Everyone still calls her 'the Nanny'. I realized you can't give in to other people's perception of you. Everyone's gonna be known for something."" [...] had to not be about trying to prove something. I feel like if you're writing music just to have a different identity in the public's eye, it's sort of the wrong motive. It's gotta be coming from a place of what you love and what you're passionate about."Jepsen sketched many of the album's demos on her tour bus while supporting Kiss, completing three by June 2013. Of these, [...] "Boy Problems" [...] would eventually finalize its form with Sia and Greg Kurstin. [...] "I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance" [...] existed as early as 2011 according to matching lyrics on a tweet authored by Jepsen. It would eventually be presented to Max Martin after the pair finished work on [...] "Tonight I'm Getting Over You" [...] in 2012; intending to cease their session at midnight, the song compelled Martin to stay for two extra hours. It was confirmed that she had worked with Josh Ramsay, Ryan Stewart, Benny Blanco and Stargate, though none of these producers appeared on the finalized project.|$|E

[...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."

It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not.
