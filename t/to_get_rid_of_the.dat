5|$|In the 1920s {{there were}} serious {{shortages}} {{of goods and}} housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst of the city's slum areas. However, {{it was not until}} the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade in order to build five large blocks of flats.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) {{agrees to}} take his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) back to the day her father Pete (Shaun Dingwall) died in 1987.

America should only be ruled by the natives when {{there is no longer a}} Spaniard there.

5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse {{find it in the}} refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid of the gun.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{conflicts}} {{characterized the}} last decades of the 13th century in the Kingdom of Hungary. For instance, a feud between King Béla and his son, Stephen caused a civil war which lasted from 1261 to 1266. Taking advantage of the emerging anarchy, Voivode Litovoi attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty in the 1270s, but he fell in a battle while fighting against royal troops. One of his successors, Basarab I of Wallachia was the first Romanian monarch whose sovereignty was internationally recognized after his victory over King Charles I of Hungary in the Battle of Posada of 1330.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{comes across}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the newspaper}} for a free trampoline. He rushes to the address from the advertisement, where Krusty is giving it away, and brings it home. Bart and Lisa are thrilled, but Marge {{is concerned about the}} potential dangers. However, Homer brushes aside her worries; he has grand plans of building a theme park in their backyard, and decides to charge others a fee to use the trampoline. Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trampoline. After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the trampoline to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross {{part of the}} line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. It {{turned out that the}} railway had to close and it took one and a half months to clear it for snow. Even a rotary snowplow at 750kW was not powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.|$|E
5|$|Despite this recognition, the {{increasing}} debts of the MDHB meant {{that by the}} 1960s the company was eager <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned {{the development of a}} mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.|$|E

5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, {{he said it was a}} relief <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|Nick flees at high speed, {{setting off}} a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witness.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the island}} village of Mandwa, the school teacher Dinanath Chauhan (Chetan Pandit) is highly {{respected}} by the villagers. The {{chief of the}} village, extremely jealous of Dinanath's popularity {{in the eyes of}} citizens, summons his evil son Kancha to destroy Dinanath's image in citizen's eyes. Kancha also has plans to start a drug cartel from Mandwa, knowing that the soil of Mandwa is rich for cultivation of cocaine. When Kancha requests the people to lend their lands to him under the pretext of expanding the salt industry of Mandwa, Dinanath dissuades the villagers from doing so. Knowing this, Kancha decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school teacher. He ambushes and murders a young girl inside the school, framing Chauhan for the murder. With the support of the villagers, Kancha then kills Chauhan by hanging him to death from a tree which is witnessed by young Vijay Chauhan (Arish Bhiwandiwala), the son of the teacher. Vijay Chauhan along with his pregnant mother Suhasini Chauhan (Zarina Wahab) leaves the village. Destitute, they find shelter in the city of Dongri,Mumbai but Vijay harbours intentions to go back to Mandwa and kill Kancha. While in Mumbai, Vijay's mother delivers a baby girl named Shiksha. Vijay is attracted to Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor), a local girl-trafficker and importantly an enemy of Kancha and wants to get into his company. He earns his favour by refusing to stand as a witness in court to a crime committed by Lala and joins his gang. Meanwhile, his mother along with his baby sister leave Vijay's side as he kills a corrupt cop at a young age and resorts to violence.|$|E
