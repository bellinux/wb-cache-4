40|$|There are two {{dominant}} {{methods for}} locating information or goods on websites <b>and</b> online systems: <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking. Most {{previous research on}} <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking methods has focused on generic websites dedicated to locating information, such as Yahoo, rather than <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking mechanisms used in specific applications, such as online shopping. In contrast, this study assessed <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking metaphors inherent in online grocery stores, where each website must provide efficient tools for locating products {{if they are to}} be successful e-commerce websites. Worldwide grocery sites were judged against a checklist of advanced <b>search</b> features, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> linking methods on the sites was evaluated using results from shopping scripts completed by eighteen participants...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue services, {{and looked}} into moving the 330 Squadron from Banak to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2014, the JACC {{has issued}} weekly updates—"Operational Search Updates"—highlighting the week's key developments, search progress, ship movements, and weather.

5|$|The police {{school was}} {{established}} in 1920 and the Governor of Svalbard was created in 1925. To increase the police force's flexibility, the municipal funding was cut and replaced with state funding in 1937. That year also saw the first two specialty agencies were created, the Police Surveillance Agency (later the Police Security Service) and the Mobile Police Service. After a border agreement was reached between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1949, the Norwegian Border Commission was established the following year. The Criminal Investigation Service {{was established in}} 1959, and <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue system with two joint coordination centers and sub-centers for each police district was created in 1970.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue {{efforts for}} Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States {{joined in the}} effort. During {{the first days of}} the search, the Aruban {{government}} gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the rescue effort. Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline. Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams. Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied. She subsequently stayed at the nearby Wyndham Hotel's presidential suite.|$|E
40|$|Bilateral taxi-customer <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> meeting occur {{anywhere}} on roads. It {{could be in}} residential/ commercial zones or at prescribed taxi stands such as an airport or a railway station. In <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> meeting, taxi driver considers both <b>the</b> expected <b>searching</b> or waiting time cost and ride revenue, while the customer seeks for a taxi ride to minimize total generalized travel cost. This thesis presents a meaningful matching function to spell out <b>the</b> <b>searching</b> <b>and</b> meeting frictions that arises endogenously {{as a result of}} the distinct spatial feature of the area and spot meetings and the customer-taxi decisions. A system of simultaneous equations is then developed based on the survey data on taxi service in urban area of Hong Kong over the last ten years...|$|R

50|$|<b>Search</b> <b>and</b> rescue (SAR) is <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for <b>and</b> {{provision}} {{of aid to}} people who are in distress or imminent danger. The general field of <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue includes many specialty sub-fields, typically determined by the type of terrain <b>the</b> <b>search</b> is conducted over. These include mountain rescue; ground <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue, including <b>the</b> use of <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue dogs; urban <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue in cities; combat <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue on <b>the</b> battlefield and air-sea rescue over water.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue response, crash {{recovery}} operation, {{and investigation}} by the Government of Canada took over four years and cost CAD 57 million (at that time approximately US$38 million). The Transportation Safety Board of Canada's (TSB) report of their investigation stated that flammable material used in the aircraft's structure allowed a fire to spread {{beyond the control of}} the crew, resulting in a loss of control and the crash of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E

5|$|The German Navy {{placed an}} order for 22 Sea King Mk.41s on 20 June 1969 as a {{replacement}} for the Grumman Albatross flying boat in <b>the</b> <b>Search</b> <b>and</b> Rescue Role. This was the first export sale for the Westland Sea King, and was the first dedicated Search and Rescue Sea King variant, with an enlarged cabin and more fuel. The German Sea Kings had similar radar and navigation equipment to the HAS.1, but was not fitted with sonar. The 22 Sea Kings were delivered between April 1973 and September 1974, equipping Marinefliegergeschwader 5 (MFG 5) (Naval Air Wing 5). An additional Sea King was delivered in April 1975 to replace one destroyed in a gale. The surviving Sea Kings were upgraded between 1986 and 1988, adding the capability to carry Sea Skua anti-ship missiles, which required the addition of a Ferranti Seaspray radar in a nose radome.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} fatality {{associated with}} the storm occurred in Taytay, Rizal, after heavy rains on May27 triggered a mudslide that killed an infant and injured three other people. That same day the rains resulted in thick traffic jams in Manila. Strong winds {{in the capital city}} also toppled billboards and electric posts. Floodwaters forced over 600families to evacuate in Valenzuela, a suburb located northwest of Manila. Similarly strong winds in Pangasinan caused widespread power outage to much of the province. Areas in the central parts of the province experienced their worst flooding conditions in at least 60years. Two ferries capsized off of Minalabac, Camarines Sur, killing six people. Sixty-seven others were rescued in <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue operation that followed the incident. Overall, Linfa killed 41people in the Philippines due to flooding. Damage {{associated with the}} tropical storm included ₱66million (US$1.25million) to agriculture and livestock, ₱83.4million (US$1.58million) to fisheries, and ₱42.9million (US$800,000) to infrastructure, equating to a total of ₱192.3million (US$3.65million) in damage in the Philippines. Nationwide, 8,367persons in roughly 1,686families evacuated into 44evacuation centers {{at the height of the}} storm. The floods destroyed 178homes and damaged an additional 2,040.|$|E
