40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{rewriting}} queries using views {{in the presence of}} access patterns, integrity constraints, disjunction, and negation. We provide asymptotically optimal algorithms for finding minimal containing and maximal contained rewritings and for deciding whether an exact rewriting exists. We show that rewriting queries using views in this case reduces (a) <b>to</b> <b>rewriting</b> queries with access patterns and constraints without views and also (b) <b>to</b> <b>rewriting</b> queries using views under constraints without access patterns. We show how to solve (a) directly and how to reduce (b) <b>to</b> <b>rewriting</b> queries under constraints only (semantic optimization). These reductions provide two separate routes to a unified solution for all three problems, based on an extension of the relational chase theory to queries and constraints with disjunction and negation. We also handle equality and arithmetic comparisons. ...|$|R

The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together <b>to</b> <b>rewrite</b> it.|$|E

40|$|We extend {{behavioural}} specification {{based on}} hidden sorts <b>to</b> <b>rewriting</b> logic by constructing a hybrid {{between the two}} underlying logics. This is achieved by defining a concept of behavioural satisfaction for rewriting logic. Our approach is semantic {{in that it is}} based on a general construction on models, called behaviour image, which uses final models in an essential way.

5|$|Throughout {{his time}} as governor, Tillman had sought a {{convention}} <b>to</b> <b>rewrite</b> South Carolina's Reconstruction-era constitution. His main purpose in doing so was to disenfranchise African Americans. They opposed Tillman's proposal, as did others, who had seen previous efforts to restrict the franchise rebound against white voters. Tillman was successful in getting the legislature to place a referendum for a constitutional convention on the November 1894 general election ballot. It passed by 2,000 votes statewide, the narrow margin gained, according to Kantrowitz, most likely through fraud. John Gary Evans was elected Tillman's successor as governor.|$|E

Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E

Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and <b>to</b> <b>rewrite</b> Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity, although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007.

We also show that in an information integration setting, maximally contained rewritings are given by the certain answers (under the usual semantics) for a set of constraints derived from the binding patterns. That is, except for defining the appropriate constraints, binding patterns do not need special treatment. Finally, we show that if there is an exact executable rewriting, there is an executable rewriting which is a union of conjunctive queries with negation...|$|R
