5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to reduce}} its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try to attract more business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E

5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled {{at the end of}} 1963.|$|E
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan {{will take at}} least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the company}} managed {{to cover it}} costs, and the company stated that it hoped to have a revenue of NOK 30 million the {{following}} year, through an ambitious expansion plan. A private offering for NOK 8 million was issued to allow this expansion. Among the purchasers was the Municipality of Narvik and Narvik Port Authority. In March, Chair Rune Arnøy was forced to withdraw after accusations of conflict of interest, since he was both chair of Ofotbanen and harbormaster at the Port of Narvik. CargoNet, a freight competitor of Ofotbanen, had {{felt that they were}} being unfairly treated by the port after the municipality had bought shares in Ofotbanen and appointed Arnøy as chair. The legality of the port's purchase of the shares was considered by the Norwegian Coastal Administration; though deemed legal, the port authority was required to sell the shares within three years. In April, Ofotbanen received a permit to operate in Sweden, and started offering charter trains between Narvik and Kiruna in Sweden, primarily for cruise ship passengers. It also announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to bid for the public service obligations for subsidized passenger railway transport that the government was planning to conduct in 2006. In June, Ofotbanen received permission to operate freight trains throughout the entire railway network in Norway. This was the first time such permission was granted to a different company than NSB or its subsidiaries.|$|E

The army sent separate reports, under the same conditions. The reports were digested by Kleist and Richthofen's chiefs of staff, and action was or was not taken with mutual agreement. Attack orders could be delivered in minutes to air units. A Gruppe (Group) of Ju 87s and Bf 109s was ready in reserve to respond, and could do so within 45 to 70 minutes.
