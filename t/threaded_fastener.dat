5000|$|A bolt is an {{externally}} <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> {{designed for}} insertion through holes in assembled parts, and is normally {{intended to be}} tightened or released by torquing a nut.

An externally <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> which {{is prevented from being}} turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt.

5000|$|The {{guard is}} {{fastened}} to the blade, plug, and grip assemblies by the pommel, a type of <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener,</b> the specific type of which depends {{on the type of}} grip in use. There are two types of grips used for foils: the traditional straight grips with long, external pommels (comprising the French, Italian, and Spanish varieties, and orthopedic); and the newer design of pistol grips, which fix the hand in a specific, ergonomic position, and which have pommels that fit into a countersink {{in the back of the}} grip.|$|E
50|$|A {{coupling}} nut, {{also known}} as extension nut, is a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|E
50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the loosening tendency of a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> To achieve the objective, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed through the following procedures. Firstly, static and dynamic <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> models are derived to find the static and dynamic interior forces respectively. Secondly, for investigating the bolt loosening behaviour, the effects of thread lead angle, initial preload, vibration frequency, and the nature of material on the bolt looseness, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed by combining the above models with a Karnopp frictional model. The proposed approach not only analyses both the static and the dynamic behaviours of the bolt as well as the bolt loosening but also detects whether the bolt is within the elastic range or not. The approach can serve as a guide for designing a thread fastening procedure to avoid the failure of threaded fasteners due to vibration...|$|E
40|$|Tightening a bolt to a {{torque value}} {{is the most}} popular means of {{controlling}} the preload provided by a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> However, repeated tightening and loosening of a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener,</b> can have a dramatic effect on the friction coefficient.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{concept of a}} <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> that is {{resistant}} to loosening under vibration. The anti-loosening feature does not use any additional element {{and is based on}} modifying the geometry of the thread in the bolt. In a normal nut and bolt combination, the axial motion of the nut or bolt is linearly related to the rotation by a constant pitch. In the proposed concept, the axial motion in the bolt is chosen to be a cubic function of the rotation, while for the nut, the axial motion remains linearly related to the rotation. This mismatch results in interference during the tightening process and additional torque required to overcome this interference gives rise to the enhanced anti-loosening property. In addition, the cubic curve is designed to ensure that the mismatch results in stresses and deformation in the elastic region of the chosen material. This ensures that the nut can be removed and reused while maintaining a repeatable anti-loosening property in the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> A finite element analysis demonstrates the feasibility of this concept...|$|E

40|$|Anti-seize {{lubricant}} {{commonly used}} on threaded fasteners {{makes it difficult}} to prepare surfaces adequately for magnetic particle and liquid penetrant testing.

Two types of threaded fasteners, reactor pressure vessel closure studs and turbine casing studs, have been targeted for investigation. Eddy current techniques requiring minimal surface preparation and capable of detecting flaws are being developed for these two applications.
