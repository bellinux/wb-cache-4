A total of 369 Malaysian and 342 Jordanian English teachers were participated in the present study.

The means suggest that participants have high level perceptions about the personal usage and schooling <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> computers. Furthermore, teachers in both sexes and from different countries have high levels of perceptions toward personal usage and schooling <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> computers. For Malaysian samples, MANOVA results indicated that: males and females are similar in their attitudes toward the personal usage and schooling <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> computers. For Jordanian samples, MANOVA results indicated that: males and females are similar in their attitudes toward the personal usage and schooling <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> computers.

The main requirements and restrictions <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft in general aviation were used as a basis for determining the types of operations, in which the <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> UAVs will be the most rational and effective. The effectiveness evaluation was based on the developed method, involving evaluation of the following factors such as: advantages <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> manned aircraft, advantages <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> unmanned air- craft, problems associated with the <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> manned aircraft, problems associated with the <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> unmanned aircraft.

The article also discusses the possible strategies of UAVs development for general aviation. The so-called “mixed” strategy of UAV development is identified as the best in the current situation.
