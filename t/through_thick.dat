5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} they probably had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To be sure the main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E

25|$|Immediately postwar, Degelow {{helped found}} the Hamburger Zeitfetwilligen Korps to battle communists in Germany. He wrote his war memoirs, With the White Stag <b>Through</b> <b>Thick</b> and Thin in 1920.

25|$|The {{journey from}} Chalakudy to the Athirappilly Falls {{passes through a}} {{landscape}} of winding roads, small villages and lush green trees. Visitors can reach {{the top of the}} waterfall via a paved path that leads <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> bamboo clusters. A steep narrow path also leads {{to the bottom of the}} falls. The falls attract visitors from across India, especially during the monsoon months (June–September). About 7 million tourists visit the falls and the Vazhachal picnic spot each year.|$|E
25|$|The low budget precluded {{the use of}} stunt men or {{elaborate}} special effects. The {{cast and}} crew climbed up mountains, hacked <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> jungle, and rode ferocious Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by natives. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.|$|E

25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge.

25|$|Highway549 {{followed}} {{what is now}} Sudbury Municipal Road10 (Panache Lake Road). It travelled {{through a}} largely forested region between Lake Panache and what was then Highway17, but {{is now known as}} Municipal Road55. At Lake Panache, the route began near a marina and travelled north <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> forest, meandering east and west to avoid lakes and rivers. At one point along the route, it briefly passed into the territory of the Whitefish Lake First Nation. It encountered Municipal Road55 just west of Whitefish and just east of the current route of Highway17.|$|E
25|$|They {{successfully}} {{raided the}} village and managed to capture a large quantity of rice. Not being content with this, they wasted time plundering {{the village and}} setting fire to the temples and houses. This provided the Kandyans, numbering some 7000, {{with an opportunity to}} set up an ambush, cutting down trees to block the return route. The Portuguese, already exhausted by days of fighting, were forced to fight for each step along rough paths <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> forests. One by one they fell. Captain Álvaro de Souza and few Lascarins managed to escape and brought the news of the defeat to the Portuguese camp.|$|E

50|$|The {{harmonic}} scalpel may {{be superior}} to electrosurgery in that it can cut <b>through</b> <b>thicker</b> tissue, creates less toxic surgical smoke, and may offer greater precision. The harmonic scalpel is not as easily maneuverable as an electrosurgical instrument, and takes longer to cut and coagulate tissue. Additionally, while electrocautery {{can be used to}} coagulate bleeding tissue at any time, the harmonic scalpel only coagulates as it cuts.|$|R

25|$|The Mongol {{naval fleet}} was totally {{destroyed}} and Omar was captured. At the same time, Đại Việt's army continuously attacked and smashed to pieces Toghan's army on its withdrawal through Lạng Sơn.

Nevertheless, the Trần king accepted Kublai Khan's supremacy as the Great Khan {{in order to avoid}} more conflicts. In 1292, Temür Khan, Kublai Khan's successor, returned all detained envoys and settled for a tributary relationship with the Trần king, which continued {{to the end of the}} Yuan dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Ochre River Trail is {{situated}} deep within Riding Mountain National Park, beginning just off Highway #10 and then winding its way <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> forest {{down to a}} parking lot on the north-eastern boundary of the park. Highlights along this trail include scenic campsites, river views, stream crossings, and a serene forest setting. The trail is used by backpackers, bikers, horseback riders, and cross country skiers. Skiers can make an over-night trek from the South Trailhead to Cairn’s Cabin (located about 800m off the trail near the Ochre River Campsite) for the night and then back out again the following day. This cabin must be booked and paid for in advance. This trail has not been maintained since September 29, 2011.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1941, the {{regiment}} {{was sent to}} Greece, where it supported Australian and New Zealand infantry who were fighting to stop the German invasion there. After arriving on 6 April, {{the regiment}} moved forward towards the Yugoslav border where it attempted to defend Vevi in the Florina Valley three days later, where they had {{the distinction of being}} the first Australian artillery unit to engage German forces during the war. After mauling an SS force on the Itia–Vevi road, as the Australian and New Zealand forces were pushed back to Servia on 11 April, amidst driving snow the regiment fought a desperate rearguard effort around the Klidi Pass, firing over open sights at advancing German infantry. Falling back by battery <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> mud, the regiment came under attack from German fighter-bombers before they eventually affected their withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, ships {{operated}} in the Helsinki–Stockholm service were small liners owned by Finland Steamship Company (FÅA), Rederi AB Svea and Steamship Company Bore. The ships {{used in the}} service were not built for navigating <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> sea ice, {{and as a result}} service had to be suspended during the winter months. Siljavarustamo, a joint subsidiary of the three companies mentioned before, had begun operating purpose-built car/passenger ferries from western Finland to Stockholm and other nearby ports in 1961, {{and by the end of}} the decade Siljavarustamo begun planning for ferries for the Helsinki–Stockholm service as well. Plans were to construct two ferries for a daily service, with high enough ice classification to allow year-round traffic on the route, and high enough speed to allow them to depart in the evening, with an arrival in the following morning (instead of the daytime departures of the ships used in the service at the time).|$|E
25|$|Arriving late on 17 January, the 2/19th's arrival helped briefly {{stabilise}} {{the situation}} on the west coast, allowing the 2/29th and the 45th Indian Brigade to withdraw from Muar. Finding its position being outflanked, the combined Australian-Indian force attempted to withdraw over the bridge at Parit Sulong, fighting their way through several Japanese positions, but found the way blocked at the bridge. With supplies and ammunition running out, and being attacked from the rear by Japanese forces that had pursued them from Bakri, the Australians were forced to leave their wounded behind in the hope that they would receive medical attention from the Japanese, while the remnants of the 2/19th attempted to reach the British lines at Yong Peng, trekking <b>through</b> <b>thick</b> jungle and Japanese lines. The wounded were subsequently murdered by the Japanese in the Parit Sulong Massacre; meanwhile, only 271 personnel from the battalion reached Yong Peng. As a result, the battalion saw no further action during the fighting in Malaya. On 26 January 1941, it received a batch of 650 reinforcements, and a hasty training program implemented.|$|E
50|$|Shoki period soba-choko (1620-1720 - Genwa-Kyoho eras) {{generally}} featured poorer quality, often disfigured, thick {{sides and}} bases with oxide assuming a washed out appearance <b>through</b> <b>thicker</b> clear glaze. As the era progressed refinements and higher quality finishes become the norm. Traditional design were simple hand painted and also used stencils/stamping known as inban. The soba-choko was generally heavy in feel. The shape and design were stable and featured similar base, oxide designs and patterning.|$|R
