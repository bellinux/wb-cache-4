5|$|Dean, a {{scientist}} and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted {{a large scale}} scientific test <b>that</b> <b>involved</b> {{more than one hundred}} cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables—but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis pooled 40 studies <b>that</b> <b>involved</b> 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.|$|E

5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension <b>that</b> <b>involved</b> connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines <b>that</b> <b>involved</b> connecting US31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. Until the freeway is complete, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future, and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.|$|E
