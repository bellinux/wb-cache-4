40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} for river engineers is the design of hydraulic structures which can control rivers natural dynamics {{and at the same}} time assure their environmental sustainability. In fact, especially in the last few decades, ecological and biological hydraulic structure's impact has become more and more important. Thus the main problem is to design an eco-friendly structure which is able to conjugate the traditional hydraulic scopes with a minimization of the environmental impact. Block ramps can be one possible solution. Block ramps are hydraulic structures which are generally used in mountain river restoration projects. <b>They</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> loose or fixed rocks disposed on a sloping bed. They can be inserted in stream corridors and can also be used as fish passages, as they don't break river morphology. Block ramps are structures which dissipate a big amount of energy, both on the ramp bed and in the downstream stilling basin. The dissipation is due to the localized stream slope variations and the high roughness conditions. Generally, a hydraulic jump takes place downstream of the ramp toe, thus a scour depth is formed which has to be controlled in order to assure the structure stability. The scour control can both be done by using a particular stilling basin granulometry downstream of the ramp toe or inserting structures like sills in opportune spatial positions in the stilling basin, which consent to minimize the scour lengths...|$|E

40|$|The {{accelerating}} pace {{of globalization}} places an imperative on formal schooling {{to figure out}} how to educate students for the rapidly changing world that today reaches even into the smallest towns and regions of our shared globe. This project attempts to respond to that imperative by examining the moral component of schooling, and specifically, what might be the best way to provide moral education. I begin from a premise that prevalent existing moral education constructs fall short of this task because <b>they</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> pre-determined morals that students are expected to learn and adopt or they teach about morality systems without analyzing their merits, preventing the development of the important skill of judgment. In a world of significantly different cultures and ways of living, such forms of moral education are simply incapable of providing the kind of education in morality that can withstand and accommodate the diversity that exists and the new forms of life that are yet to come. Cosmopolitan education, based in cosmopolitan philosophy, is posited as a possible answer to this question. Beginning with cosmopolitanism's grounding in the principle of shared humanity I show how cosmopolitan education might offer a more mutually beneficial response to evolving global conditions. This project uses conceptual analysis to examine the concepts of an education in morality and Hannah Arendt's work on natality, thinking, action, and the public space of politics to show that an education in morality is public and political. As a result, cosmopolitan education can use the processes found in Thomas Nagel's epistemological restraint, Jürgen Habermas's discourse ethics, and Chantal Mouffe's agonistic pluralism to help students acquire a disposition that both promotes active and flexible engagement in moral inquiry, as well as in other educational experiences, and embraces plurality and diversity by recognizing the positive contribution that others can make in one's life. Shared humanity emerges as a collective possession of what Arendt calls 'the human condition,' which is essentially a collection of the human conditions of plurality, natality, action, and one that I add, the condition of uncertainty. Through a cosmopolitan lens, these conditions frame the way political processes can be utilized in an education in morality to encourage the development of a disposition that I call 'moral agonism,' which equips students to inquire into and participate in the development of morality in the face of constantly evolving and uncertain conditions in the world...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this contribution is to present a number of methodological problems arising in the collection and interpretation of data from (large) corpora. In particular, {{we want to show}} how large corpora can be used to test hypotheses concerning linguistic factors determining the meaning and use of connectives, focusing on a number of methodological issues. Corpus-based approaches to connectives are not new, but classically <b>they</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> fully analysed but relatively small corpora, or of large corpora of which a random set is analysed. The reason for this quantitative restriction is clear: the data-analyses are completely hand-based. While these empirical studies are useful from a qualitative point of view, they all suffer from the same quantitative drawback, namely the relatively small number of data (rarely more than 100 occurrences are analysed, mostly only 50). In addition, most of these analyses are still too analyst-dependent, making generalizations and replications difficult. In ongoing research we propose to change this situation by handling exhaustively large corpora (with hundreds and even thousands of occurrences of the same linguistic phenomenon) and by implementing the analysis procedures to make them analyst-independent (Bestgen, Degand & Spooren 2003, submitted). This is done by exploiting prior linguistic results with their level of detail and sophistication but adding a much larger scale of analysis. In short, our general purpose is to enrich qualitative linguistic analyses with massive quantitative data. To achieve this goal, we make use of two components: a series of linguistic hypotheses to test, derived from the literature on connectives, and a number of NLP techniques to analyse the data, in our case Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer, Folz & Laham, 1998) and Thematic Text Analysis (Popping, 2000). The combination of these two techniques has proven to be successful. That is, we succeeded in confirming a number of linguistic hypotheses resulting from prior small-scale corpus analyses. According to these results, the meaning and use of (Dutch causal) connectives in newspaper corpora is determined by a series of factors including the level of subjectivity of the environing context, the flow of discourse (topicality), and the degree of polyphony of the connective. It is the topic of ongoing research to refine a number of these results and to apply the method to the use and meaning of French causal connectives in different text genres. Part of these results will be presented at the workshop. These first successful results should not hide that the method is not free of methodological flaws. The main issue we would like to raise concerns the selection and interpretation of the data to analyse. This problem arises in hand-based analyses first, if the procedure is implemented, it arises in automatic analyses too. With respect to the analysis of (causal) connectives the specific questions that could arise are the following: (i) should all the observed data be included in the analyses (what about the "non-causal" use of "causal" connectives?), (ii) which problems arise in (hand-) coding the data (how many different causal relations?, what about analyst-dependent interpretations? (the problem of low interrater agreement), what is the minimal sample of data to analyse?, …), (iii) {{what is the relationship between}} fine-grained linguistic analyses and LSA-base statistic analyses? (with the particular problem of the determination of the environing context which can be intuitive in hand-based analyses, but must be implemented in automatic analyses), and finally (iv) what contributions can the two methods (hand-base and automatic) make to one another...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{and activities of}} a terebellid polychaete, Eupolymnia heterobranchia, {{in the presence of}} artificially irrigated tubes and the effects of Eupolymnia and artificial irrigation on silicate removal from sediment pore waters were examined in the laboratory. Eupolymnia built more tubes and longer tubes in sediments containing artificially irrigated tubes relative to unventilated sediments. Morcovcr, worm tubes were located closer to artificially ventilated tubes than expected by chance. Silicate fluxes were positively related to the dry weight ofworms and to the number of tubes in sediments when <b>they</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> Eupolymnia tubes or artificially irrigated tubes alone. However when tube types were mixed (Eupolymnia + artificially irrigated tubes), silicate Auxcs were lower than in sediments containing arti-ficially ventilated tubes alone. Thus, worm behavior was altered by the prescncc of artificially irrigated tubes. In addition, interactions between worms and artificially ventilated tubes served to rcducc silicate flux relative to sediments containing artificially ventilated tubes only. In marine benthic environments, the distri-butions of organisms are affected by a suite of physical and biological processes, including currents (e. g. Bckman 1983), internal waves (Shanks and Wright 1987), the physical and chemical properties of substrates (Wethey 1986; Woodin et al. 1993), the supply of larvae to the habitat (Roughgarden et al. 1988), the ability of larvae to establish themselves during settlement and postsettlement events (Wood-in 1986) and biological interactions (e. g. pre-dation, competition) among established mem-bers of the infaunal community (Woodin 198 1; Peterson and Beal 1989).

Recent studies have {{revealed}} that single-layer transition-metal oxides and dichalcogenides (MX 2) might offer properties superior to those of graphene. So far, only very few MX 2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single layers, {{and some of them}} have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations of MX 2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing, single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if <b>they</b> <b>consisted</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different from that of graphene; they {{can be viewed as a}} positively charged plane of transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations. Some of these single-layer structures are direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors, only one compound is half-metal, and the rest are either ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic metals. Because of their surface polarity, band gap, high in-plane stiffness, and suitability for functionalization by adatoms or vacancies, these single-layer structures can be utilized in a wide range of technological applications, especially as nanoscale coatings for surfaces contributing crucial functionalities.

They physically connect the nucleus with the peripheral cytoskeleton and are critically {{involved in a}} variety of dynamic processes, such as nuclear anchorage, movement and positioning and meiotic chromosome dynamics. Moreover, they are shown to be essential for maintaining nuclear shape. FINDINGS: Based on detailed expression analysis and biochemical approaches, we show here that during mouse sperm development, a terminal cell differentiation process characterized by profound morphogenic restructuring, two novel distinctive LINC complexes are established. <b>They</b> <b>consist</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> spermiogenesis-specific Sun 3 and Nesprin 1 or Sun 1 eta, a novel non-nuclear Sun 1 isoform, and Nesprin 3. We could find that these two LINC complexes specifically polarize to opposite spermatid poles likely linking to sperm-specific cytoskeletal structures. Although, as shown in co-transfection/immunoprecipitation experiments, SUN proteins appear to arbitrarily interact with various KASH partners, our study demonstrates that they actually are able to confine their binding to form distinct LINC complexes. CONCLUSIONS: Formation of the mammalian sperm head involves assembly and different polarization of two novel spermiogenesis-specific LINC complexes. Together, our findings suggest that theses LINC complexes connect the differentiating spermatid nucleus to surrounding cytoskeletal structures to enable its well-directed shaping and elongation, which in turn is a critical parameter for male fertility...|$|R

From one small eminence, I counted sixty of these craters, all of which were within a third of a mile from each other, and many were much closer. I measured the distance between two very small craters, and found that it was only thirty yards from the summit-rim of one to the rim of the other. Small streams of black, basaltic lava, containing olivine and much glassy feldspar, have flowed from many, but not from all of these craters. The surfaces of the more recent streams were exceedingly rugged, and were crossed by great fissures; the older streams were only a little less rugged; and they were all blended and mingled together in complete confusion. The different growth, however, of the trees on the streams, often plainly marked their different ages. Had it not been for this latter character, the streams could in few cases have been distinguished; and, consequently, this wide undulatory tract might have (as probably many tracts have) been erroneously considered as formed by one great deluge of lava, instead of by a multitude of small streams, erupted from many small orifices.|$|R
