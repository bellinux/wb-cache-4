40|$|AbstractThe binding of C-protein, a {{component}} of thick filament of myofibrils, <b>to</b> <b>regulated</b> actin filaments in {{the presence or absence}} of CA 2 + was studied. The amount of C-protein bound <b>to</b> <b>regulated</b> actin filaments in the presence of CA 2 + was higher than those in the absence of Ca 2 +. The addition of C-protein <b>to</b> <b>regulated</b> actin caused an increase in turbidity, especially in the presence of Ca 2 +, and this was found to result from side-by-side association of actin filaments into bundles. In the absence of Ca 2 +, no actin filament bundles were formed...|$|R
