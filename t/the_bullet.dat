5|$|The Wrestle Kingdom 9 undercard {{featured}} several matches involving <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club, {{which was}} led by A.J. Styles. The group dominated NJPW for most of 2014, holding all four of its heavyweight championships during the summer. After the NJPW–GFW partnership was forged, GFW head Jeff Jarrett joined <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club on August10. On December 7, during a Bullet Club post-match assault on Tomoaki Honma, NJPW veteran tag team Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) stormed into the ring {{to the aid of}} Honma, driving <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club away. They then joined Honma to challenge the stable to a six-man tag team match at Wrestle Kingdom 9. Bad Luck Fale, Yujiro Takahashi and Jeff Jarrett—making his NJPW ring debut—were scheduled to represent <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club at the event.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors said that if <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
50|$|During the 1972-73 NBA season, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{acquired}} Elvin Hayes {{from the}} Houston Rockets. In <b>the</b> draft, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> acquired Kevin Porter. After a slow start, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{had a strong}} December by posting a 10-4 record.The Bullets, playing their tenth and final season in Baltimore finished the season by winning the Central Division for the 3rd straight season. In <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> faced their playoff rivals the New York Knicks. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> fell in 5 games by a 1-4 margin. Following <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would move to Landover, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and became <b>the</b> Capital <b>Bullets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> playoffs <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{would get}} off to a quick start as they grabbed a 3-1 series lead over the Philadelphia 76ers. However, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would find {{themselves}} in a 7th game and that game <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would emerge victorious 128-120. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would face <b>the</b> New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would finally break through in Game 5 and break the tie in the series by beating the Knicks at Madison Square Garden 89-84. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would have a chance to close the series out at home, but the Knicks would bounce back with a 113-96 win to force a 7th and deciding game in New York. In the seventh game, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would triumph, winning in New York by 2 points to reach the NBA Finals. However, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would be swept in 4 straight games by the Milwaukee Bucks.|$|R
5000|$|The 1967-68 {{season was}} <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> 7th {{season in the}} league. After losing 61 games, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> were forced to rebuild through the draft. With the first overall pick, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{selected}} Earl [...] "The Pearl" [...] Monroe. Monroe was a flashy player, a deft ball handler, and a creative, unconventional shot maker. He was {{the first player to}} make the reverse spin on the dribble a trademark move. In his rookie season he would lead <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> in scoring with 24.3 points per game, and win the Rookie of the Year Award. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> improved by 15 games posting a 36-46 record. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would still finish in last place.|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club. Distractions by <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> can exclude {{a large number}} of weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire <b>the</b> <b>bullet.</b> The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> came from that particular weapon.|$|E
5|$|Hyogo {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{industrial}} areas of Kobe. Fujitsu Ten is headquartered within the ward, and other large corporations including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have manufacturing facilities in Hyogo. In particular, railcars for <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> train are manufactured in Hyogo by Kawasaki.|$|E
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{returning}} to <b>the</b> NBL in 2016, the rivalry has continued with Adelaide defeating <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{in their first}} encounter at home, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> returning <b>the</b> favour with an away win in Adelaide, while a week later Adelaide spoiled <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> regular season return to the Entertainment Centre {{for the first time}} since 1997 with a resounding 101-83 win.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{would get}} started on a strong note as they won 9 {{straight}} games in November. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would finish {{with a record of}} 50-32. In a competitive Eastern Division, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> finished <b>the</b> season 3rd place.|$|R

5|$|In November 1995, he was {{scheduled}} to wrestle for Smoky Mountain Wrestling, teaming with Buddy Landel in a series of matches against The Punisher and Tommy Rich, but due to LeDuc retiring, <b>The</b> <b>Bullet</b> took his place teaming with Landel.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} match, <b>the</b> <b>Bullet</b> Club's Bad Luck Fale, Jeff Jarrett, and Yujiro Takahashi faced New Japan's Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima, and Tomoaki Honma. Takahashi {{received}} a Jarrett guitar shot meant for Honma, a 3D from Tencozy, and a Kokeshi diving headbutt from Honma before Honma pinned {{him for the}} victory at 5 minutes and 35 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{played in}} their 8th season in <b>the</b> NBA. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{continued}} to rebuild through the draft by selecting center Wes Unseld, a 2-time All-American from Louisville. [...] Unseld {{would have an}} immediate impact for <b>the</b> <b>Bullets.</b> He finished 2nd in the NBA in rebounding with 18.2 rebounds per game as <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> went from worst to first posting a league best 57-25 record. Rookie Wes Unseld won both the Rookie of the Year and MVP. [...] In <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would show their inexperience as they were swept in 4 straight games by the New York Knicks.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{selected}} Muggsy Bogues twelfth {{overall in}} the 1987 Draft, who at 5'3" [...] is the smallest player in NBA history. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would {{get off to a}} slow start as coach Kevin Loughery was fired 27 games into the season with <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> holding an 8–19 record. To replace Loughery, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> hired former MVP Wes Unseld. Under Unseld <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> improved as they were able to reach the playoffs again with a record of 38–44. After losing the first 2 games on the road in the first round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs to the Detroit Pistons, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> fought back and forced a 5th game with 2 home wins. They would lose game 5 by 21 points. It would be 9 years before Washington would return to the NBA Playoffs.|$|R
50|$|After the {{shooting}}, Suzanne {{entered a}} state of shock. She could only dwell {{on the fact that}} when the shooting started, she had somehow stopped <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> in midair and was able to get herself out of the path of <b>the</b> <b>bullets.</b> In actuality she had stopped time around <b>the</b> <b>bullets,</b> effectively freezing them in place. Unfortunately, she was unable {{to do the same for}} her parents, and could only watch as <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> tore into them.|$|R
5|$|King was {{fatally shot}} by James Earl Ray at 6:01p.m., April 4, 1968, {{as he stood}} on the motel's second-floor balcony. <b>The</b> <b>bullet</b> entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then {{traveled}} down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1951, King Abdullah I {{was shot}} three times by a Palestinian gunman {{as he entered}} the mosque, killing him. His {{grandson}} Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected <b>the</b> <b>bullet.</b>|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{were matched}} {{up against the}} New York Knicks for the 2nd {{consecutive}} season.After losing the first 2 games on <b>the</b> road, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> battled back to win the next 2 games at home. After the Knicks captured Game 5 in New York, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> forced a 7th game with a 96-87 win at the Civic Center.However, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would fall in Game 7. The Knicks {{would go on to}} win the NBA Championship.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970-71 {{season was}} <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> 10th {{season in the}} NBA. The NBA divided itself into 4 {{divisions}} as <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{were placed in the}} Central Division inside the Eastern Conference. Despite playing close to [...]500 basketball all season, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would capture <b>the</b> Central Division with a 42-40 record.|$|R
50|$|In the Eastern Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{would find}} {{themselves}} down 3 games to 1 facing the San Antonio Spurs. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> would rally {{to win the}} next 2 games and force a 7th game at home. In Game 7 <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> would rally again. They overcame a fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Spurs 107-105.|$|R
5|$|The player {{controls}} a skeet shooter who {{is shooting}} clay pigeons. By pressing {{the button on}} the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle.

5|$|William McKinley {{was assassinated}} on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music {{on the grounds}} of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died eight days later on September 14 from {{gangrene}} caused by <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> wounds.|$|E
5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E
50|$|Both teams {{made it back}} to {{the finals}} the {{following}} season, with <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> holding home court advantage. That season <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> won 54 games while the Sonics won 52. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> eliminated <b>the</b> Atlanta Hawks (4-3) and San Antonio Spurs (4-3) to advance while the Sonics eliminated the Los Angeles Lakers (4-1) and the Phoenix Suns (4-3). <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> appeared to have momentum with a Game 1 victory at the Capital Centre, but the Sonics took the next four games to win their only NBA championship.|$|R
50|$|In the Eastern Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> took a 3-1 series lead {{against the}} {{defending}} Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> lost Game 5 {{on the road}} and returned home to play Game 6. In the closing seconds, Wes Unseld would rebound a shot of his own miss to give <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> a dramatic 101-99 victory.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the regular season, losing 6 of their first 10 games. On January 13, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> beat <b>the</b> {{defending}} Champion Portland Trail Blazers to improve to 24-15, capping an 18-5 run over 23 games. Injuries would begin to have an effect on the team as <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> struggled, as they would lose 13 of their next 18 games. Hovering a few games above [...]500 for the rest of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> managed to make the playoffs with a 44-38 record.|$|R
5|$|After {{attending}} a theatre show on March 18, Morgan Earp was assassinated by gunmen firing {{from a dark}} alley through a door window into a room where he was playing billiards. Morgan was struck in the right side. <b>The</b> <b>bullet</b> shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another round narrowly missed Wyatt. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch. The assassins escaped {{in the dark and}} Morgan died 40 minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 1974-75 Washington <b>Bullets</b> {{played in}} their 14th season. The {{franchise}} changed their name from <b>the</b> Capital <b>Bullets</b> to <b>the</b> Washington <b>Bullets.</b> <b>The</b> franchise captured its 6th division title in 7 years by posting a franchise best record of 60-22. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> were nearly unbeatable at home posting {{a record of}} 36-5 at the Capital Centre. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> won their second Eastern Conference title, but were swept in the NBA Finals in four games by the Golden State Warriors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{failed to}} get to the finals {{during the early years of}} the 2000s. The 2000-01 season was {{especially}} disappointing for <b>the</b> <b>Bullets,</b> as they finished second-last on the regular season table, winning just 4 of their 28 fixtures. Although, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> won 22 of their 33 fixtures in 2003-04 to finish in a more respectable fourth place on the ladder.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>the</b> mono-metal <b>bullets</b> {{fall short}} of this {{velocity}} threshold due {{to the need to}} seat <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> deeper owing to the length of <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> and <b>the</b> need to stay within the maximum overall length specification of the cartridge. This is because <b>the</b> lower mono-metal <b>bullets</b> have a higher length to weight ratio than conventional bullets. Manufacturers such as A-Square have chosen to load slightly lighter bullets [...] instead of <b>the</b> [...] <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
