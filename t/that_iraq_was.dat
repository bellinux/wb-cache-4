25|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 699 {{was also}} passed in 1991, declaring <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} for all funding of UNSCOM's inspections in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|A theory <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> {{behind the}} attacks, {{based upon the}} {{evidence}} that the powder was weaponized and some reports of alleged meetings between 9/11 conspirators and Iraqi officials, {{may have contributed to the}} momentum which ultimately led to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 2005, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said he {{had warned}} the Bush {{administration}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> hurtling toward disintegration, and that the election planned for December was unlikely to make any difference. U.S. officials immediately made statements rejecting this view.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Butler {{reports to}} the UN Security Council <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> still {{blocking}} inspections.|$|R
5000|$|Headlines such as [...] "Jesus Saves!" [...] were amended as {{a result}} of {{complaints}} that largely focussed on religious insensitivity given <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> a predominantly Muslim nation.|$|R
5000|$|I {{found it}} {{interesting}} that on the tape <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> mentioned, which <b>is</b> a reminder <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the war}} against extremists. If Al-Qaeda bothers to mention Iraq, it's because they want to achieve their objectives in <b>Iraq,</b> which <b>is</b> to drive us out.|$|R
25|$|In the mainly Shia city of Basra, {{armed men}} in police uniforms seized eleven Sunni Muslim men, {{including}} some Saudi, Turkish and Egyptian nationals, from the Mina prison. The seized men were later found dead and {{were believed to}} have been tortured. Ninety reprisal attacks on mosques were reported. Iraq's Kurdish Sunni President Jalal Talabani warned <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> on the brink of civil war.|$|E
25|$|Blix {{personally}} made repeated {{inspection visits}} to the Iraqi nuclear reactor Osiraq before its attempted destruction by the Iranians, in 1980, and its eventual destruction by the Israeli Air Force in 1981 during Operation Opera. Although most agreed <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> years away {{from being able to}} build a nuclear weapon, the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E
25|$|During this time, part of {{her work}} {{concerned}} {{the determination of the}} use of aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq. CIA analysts prior to the Iraq invasion were quoted by the White House as believing <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> trying to acquire nuclear weapons and that these aluminum tubes could be used in a centrifuge for nuclear enrichment. David Corn and Michael Isikoff argued that the undercover work being done by Plame and her CIA colleagues in the Directorate of Central Intelligence Nonproliferation Center strongly contradicted such a claim. However, the CIA was concerned enough to send Plame's husband, Joseph C. Wilson, to Niger in 2002 to investigate the potential sale of nuclear materials from Niger to Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|... "According to the CIA's report, all U.S. {{intelligence}} {{experts agree}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> seeking nuclear weapons. There is little question that Saddam Hussein wants {{to develop nuclear}} weapons." [...] Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) - Congressional Record, October 9, 2002 ...|$|R
5000|$|Ironically, the Pentagon {{said that}} an Iranian {{helicopter}} had joined a Saudi Arabian vessel in rescue operations. [...] Furthermore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{investigation into the}} incident recommended <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>be</b> held accountable, a finding the government of Iraq eventually complied with.|$|R
50|$|Jordanian leaders worry <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming}} {{a haven for}} terrorist groups, a fear dramatically heightened by the November 2005 suicide bombings in Amman. Jordan also {{has an interest in}} the development of <b>Iraq</b> and <b>is</b> anxious about the growing Iranian involvement in Iraqi politics, and more broadly increasing Iranian and Shiite influence in the region.|$|R
500|$|On 5 March 2010, Gordon Brown {{appeared}} before the inquiry. In a four-hour hearing he told the inquiry that he believed the war had been [...] "right" [...] and that intelligence briefings had convinced him <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> a threat that [...] "had to be dealt with". He said that his predecessor Tony Blair had kept him informed despite Blair not being aware of some developments and that the main issue which concerned him was <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> in breach of UN resolutions. He feared the [...] "new world order {{we were trying to}} create would be put at risk" [...] if the international community did not act together to deal with Iraq. When asked about equipment, Brown said that British troops in Iraq had all the equipment they needed. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said, [...] "Gordon Brown's aim today appears to be to look and sound different from Tony Blair whilst simultaneously opening up no gap of substance with him and the decisions he took".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{in discussions}} over {{proposed}} U.S. action against Iraq, McCain {{was a strong}} supporter of the Bush administration's position. He stated <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a clear and present danger to the United States of America", and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002. He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people. In May 2003, McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts, saying it was unwise at a time of war. By November 2003, after a trip to Iraq, he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, saying that more U.S. troops were needed; the following year, McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|During the Suez Crisis, Hussein {{requested}} that Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq send troops to Jordan as a precautionary measure {{to prevent a}} potential invasion of the country by the tripartite allies. Prime Minister al-Said was reticent to put Iraqi troops under Abu Nuwar's command and suggested that Abu Nuwar be dismissed as a prerequisite to any deployment of troops to Jordan. This did not occur, but the Iraqis nonetheless sent troops to Jordan. However, their deployment was opposed by Nabulsi on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> {{a member of the}} Baghdad Pact, an alliance of Middle Eastern countries with the UK that was condemned by Arab nationalists as a British-led attempt to stifle pan-Arab unity, instead of the Egyptian-Jordanian-Syrian-Saudi alliance known as the [...] "Amman Pact". Despite Hussein's protestations, Nabulsi, using his prerogative as head of the government, succeeded in forcing the Iraqis' withdrawal by the end of November.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} given to Newsweek International published July 24, 2006, Albright gave her opinion on current U.S. foreign policy. Albright said: [...] "I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> {{going to turn}} out to be the greatest disaster in American foreign policy - worse than Vietnam." ...|$|R
5000|$|Amendment in {{the nature}} of a {{substitute}} sought to have the United States work through the United Nations to seek to resolve the matter of ensuring <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not developing weapons of mass destruction, through mechanisms such as the resumption of weapons inspections, negotiation, enquiry, mediation, regional arrangements, and other peaceful means.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lack of any}} official, government-established Sharia {{courts in}} Iraq, {{and the use of}} the phrase [...] "a {{principal}} source of legislation" [...] rather than [...] "the principal source of legislation" [...] in the Iraqi constitution, has been understood [...] to mean <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not a constitutional theocracy, at least according to Hirschls definition.|$|R
2500|$|Cole {{rejects the}} Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi {{cooperation}} with Al-Qaeda, noting that Saddam Hussein had [...] "persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number", {{as well as}} claims to the effect <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{emergency}} {{meeting of the}} National Security Council {{on the day of}} the attacks, Rumsfeld asked, [...] "Why shouldn’t we go against Iraq, not just al-Qaeda?" [...] with Wolfowitz adding <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "brittle, oppressive regime that might break easily—it was doable," [...] and, according to John Kampfner, [...] "from that moment on, he and Wolfowitz used every available opportunity to press the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2007, the New Statesman printed {{selected}} {{portions of}} a 1976 piece by Hitchens which they claimed [...] "took a more admiring {{view of the}} Iraqi dictator" [...] than his later strong support for ousting Saddam Hussein. In this Hitchens pointed to Iraq's military strength, oil reserves and young leadership to argue <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a {{force to be reckoned}} with" [...] and described Saddam Hussein as a leader [...] "who has sprung from being an underground revolutionary gunman to perhaps the first visionary Arab statesman since Nasser." [...] He also argued: ...|$|E
5000|$|Israeli {{intelligence}} reports <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> has <b>been</b> attempting to purchase missile gyroscopes (guidance devices) from a Russian export company.|$|R
40|$|Reports of {{conflict}} in Iraq may {{give the impression that}} the central government is so weak and unpopular <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> on the verge of fragmenting into a loose confederation, and that major sectors of the population are aligning themselves with militias. However, the findings of a new WPO poll of Iraqis suggest a different picture...|$|R
2500|$|... – Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's spokesman, Ali al-Moussawi, {{said that}} he {{expressed}} support for the Egyptian people's choices, while also congratulating the interim president, Adly Mansour. al-Moussawi said <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> [...] "looking forward to boosting bilateral relations" [...] and is [...] "certain that the new president will move on with the new plan in holding elections and safeguarding national reconciliation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{he was not}} {{responsible}} for writing {{any part of the}} dossier, Kelly's experience of weapons inspections led to his being asked to proofread sections of the draft dossier on the history of inspections. Kelly was unhappy with some of the claims in the draft, particularly a claim originating from August 2002 <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> capable of firing battlefield biological and chemical weapons within 45 minutes of an order to use them (known as [...] "the 45-minute claim"). Kelly's colleagues queried the inclusion of the claim, but their superiors were satisfied when they took it up with MI6 through the Joint Intelligence Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{focused on}} what they termed as factual inaccuracies, such as Miller's claim that [...] "Hans Blix, {{the former chief of}} the {{international}} weapons inspectors, bears some responsibility [...] " [...] because he [...] "told the U.N. in January 2003 that despite America’s ultimatum, Saddam was still not complying fully with his U.N. pledges." [...] Her critics pointed out that, although Blix indeed reported that [...] "Iraq wasn't fully compliant," [...] he also reported <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> [...] "largely cooperative with regard to process," [...] and, subsequently, [...] "made it abundantly clear, in an interview published in The New York Times, that nothing he'd seen at the time justified war," [...] an interview taken by Miller herself.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{members of}} the {{international}} community, especially the U.S., continued to view Saddam as a bellicose tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region. After the September 11 attacks, Vladimir Putin began to tell the United States <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> preparing terrorist attacks against the United States. In his January 2002 {{state of the union address}} to Congress, President George W. Bush spoke of an [...] "axis of evil" [...] consisting of Iran, North Korea, and Iraq. Moreover, Bush announced that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, because of the threat of its weapons of mass destruction. Bush stated that [...] "The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade... Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Rohrabacher {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq's</b> borders <b>be</b> redrawn {{in response}} to the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.|$|R
5000|$|President of the UN Security Council says <b>that</b> <b>Iraq's</b> demands <b>are</b> {{unacceptable}} {{and that}} the country must withdraw its troops from the Kuwait border.|$|R
2500|$|Ritter again {{promoted}} a conciliatory approach toward Iraq in the 2000 documentary , {{which he wrote}} and directed. The film tells {{the history of the}} UNSCOM investigations through interviews and video footage of inspection missions. In the film, Ritter argues <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "defanged tiger" [...] and that the inspections were successful in eliminating significant Iraqi WMD capabilities. (For more see below under [...] "Documentary".) ...|$|R
2500|$|Besides arguing <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> not the top {{strategic}} {{priority in the}} war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In a 15August 2002 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled [...] "Don't attack Saddam", Scowcroft wrote that, [...] "Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes", and, [...] "could even swell the ranks of the terrorists." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized for his 'mistakes' over Iraq War and admitted there were 'elements of truth' to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS.|$|E
2500|$|International {{response}} at the United Nations {{took two}} paths. The United Nations Security Council issued a unanimous and almost immediate response on 19 June 1981, following eight meetings and statements from Iraq and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Security Council Resolution 487 strongly condemned the attack as a [...] "clear {{violation of the}} Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international conduct" [...] and called on Israel to refrain from such attacks in the future; the Council recognised the right of Iraq to [...] "establish programmes of technological and nuclear development" [...] and called for Israel to join Iraq within the [...] "IAEA safeguards regime" [...] of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Council also stated its consideration <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> [...] "entitled to appropriate redress for the destruction it has suffered." [...] The United States voted for the resolution and suspended the delivery of four F-16 aircraft to Israel, but blocked punitive action by the UN. The suspension on the delivery of the aircraft was lifted two months later.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{was criticized}} for his {{suggestions}} in 1999 of intelligence indicating a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, despite the fact Clarke and others concluded after investigations by 2001 that no link had been established. In Against All Enemies he writes, [...] "It is certainly possible that Iraqi agents dangled the possibility of asylum in Iraq before bin Laden at some point when everyone knew that the U.S. was pressuring the Taliban to arrest him. If that dangle happened, bin Laden's accepting asylum clearly did not," [...] (p.270). In an interview on March 21, 2004, Clarke claimed that [...] "there's absolutely no evidence <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>was</b> supporting al-Qaeda, ever." [...] Clarke claimed in his book that this conclusion was understood by the intelligence community {{at the time of}} 9/11 and the ensuing months, but top Bush administration officials were pre-occupied with finding a link between Iraq and 9/11 {{in the months that followed}} the attack, and thus, Clarke argued, the Iraq war distracted attention and resources from the war in Afghanistan and hunt for Osama bin Laden.|$|E
50|$|After the 2006 midterm Congressional elections, Congress {{has pushed}} to begin {{withdrawing}} troops from Iraq, in part {{based on the}} argument <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> a distraction, {{as opposed to a}} part of, the war on terror. Likewise, a January 2007 poll found that 57% of Americans feel <b>that</b> the <b>Iraq</b> War <b>is</b> not part of the War on Terror. By June 2007, polls revealed that only 30% of Americans support the war. On July 12, 2007 the House passed a resolution by 223 to 201, for redeployment withdrawal of U.S. armed forces out of Iraq. The resolution requires most troops to withdraw from Iraq by April 1, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The 2003 United States-British-Spanish Draft Resolution on <b>Iraq</b> <b>was,</b> {{according}} to Ambassador John Negroponte, [...] "a resolution {{to have the}} Council decide <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> not complying, is out of compliance, with Resolution 1441". The draft was initially introduced on February 24, 2003 and amended on March 7, 2003 to set a March 17 deadline for Iraq to demonstrate [...] "full, unconditional, immediate and active cooperation in accordance with its disarmament obligations." [...] The widely discussed UN resolution was not brought up for formal vote after {{it became clear that}} it would not have passed.|$|R
5000|$|Butler {{meets with}} Tariq Aziz who demands that weapons {{inspections}} must end immediately and <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> must <b>be</b> certified as free {{of weapons of}} mass destruction. Butler says he cannot do that.|$|R
