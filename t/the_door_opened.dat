5|$|Authorities {{received}} the first distress {{call from a}} person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47pm. The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ75 that was also used by Kovář), body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in car. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. , taking cover behind a bar opposite to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>opened</b> fire on the officers {{as soon as they}} entered. The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and the shooter. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered the exits, and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit. By this time, other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived, taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> John Bosco found that within, there was a dying man who was desperately asking for a priest to make his last confession. Later, John Bosco asked Dominic how he had known about that man. However, since the question made Dominic uncomfortable, John Bosco did not press the matter.|$|E

500|$|Morten then {{stated that}} they did not feel that Keč was doing things the right way. If he chose to fly to a new airport, {{negotiations}} would have to start again, perhaps in a different language. Morten urged Keč to calm down and that they wanted to solve the situation just as much as him. Keč responded by pleading for help for Bosnia. At 20:50, Keč stated [...] "I wish to release everyone and myself. Both Bosnians and Norwegians will understand this". After confirming his surrender would occur at 21:00, Keč stated that he was [...] "cold and calm" [...] and that he intended to surrender without any trouble. Directed by the negotiation, Keč went to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>opened</b> it and was arrested.|$|E
500|$|With Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> for Clark, but Welling stated he {{understood}} why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: [...] "There's the cliché that television shows with a main love interest fail {{once they get}} it together." [...] After briefly being together {{at the beginning of}} the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero. His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.|$|E

2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the drivers door window. Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> and closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|E

2500|$|Ted Rothe {{had been}} {{across the street}} {{attending}} a meeting with Warden Powell and some architects who were designing the new facility Powell wanted to build. [...] Rothe returned to his desk inside the prison at {{a few minutes before}} 4:00, oblivious to the inmate takeover. [...] To this point, there had been almost no noise, few scuffles, and no casualties. [...] He chatted with a guard for a few minutes before sitting behind his desk, which was in view of the door where inmates came to receive their medication. [...] Myles, Smart, and a third inmate named Toms came up to the door, where Myles asked to receive some pills for his migraines. [...] The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. [...] As soon as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. [...] Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. [...] Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. [...] Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.|$|E
2500|$|Natan-Zada {{boarded the}} Shefa-'Amr-bound bus on Thursday, 4 August 2005. He {{was dressed in}} full IDF uniform, {{carrying}} his IDF-issued M16 rifle, and, according to observers, wearing the skullcap, beard, and sidelocks of an observant Jew, {{as well as an}} orange ribbon hanging from his pocket. According to witnesses, the bus driver was initially surprised to see a religiously-observant Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-'Amr (an overwhelmingly Arab city) via public bus, so he asked Natan-Zada if he was certain he wanted to take his current route. [...] Upon arriving in Shefa-'Amr's primary Druze neighborhood, Natan-Zada stood up and approached the front door as if to disembark the bus. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> Natan-Zada turned around and shot the driver. He then fatally shot a man sitting behind the driver, and fired into the rest of the bus, killing two young women and wounding twenty-one passengers. When he paused to reload his weapon, a passenger grabbed the barrel of his gun, sustaining burn injuries, and he was subdued by streetgoers gathered around the scene of the bus shooting. When the police arrived at the scene he was tied up but still alive, but the small force of police officers on the scene could not prevent the crowd from lynching him, and nine police officers were injured attempting to protect him. It took the police four hours to remove his body from the scene.|$|E
