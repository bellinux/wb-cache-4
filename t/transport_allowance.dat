The {{data were collected from}} respondent on 15 construction sites, which form nucleus of a stratified population chosen for the research. The questionnaire was designed using Likert rating scale on scale 1 to 4 and seventy questionnaire distributed, while the data were analyzed with the aid of mean item score, spearman correlation coefficient method, cross tabulation analysis was conducted on the incentives and work variables to determine relationship pattern. Also, Chi square analysis and product moment correlation was carried out to validate the existing relationship between incentives and productivity index. This study presents systematic approach through which available means of enhancing workers motivation in construction firms could be identified from the perspective of incentives with particular bias for financial and non-financial incentives. The study concluded with financial incentives like <b>transport</b> <b>allowance,</b> hospital allowance, cash awards, overtime-with-pay and accident insurance being found prevalent in the foreign firms while less of these are engaged at indigenous firms. Availability of Luncheon voucher, <b>transport</b> <b>allowance</b> and vehicle loan that are of financial incentive cadre was recorded at foreign firms relative to <b>transport</b> <b>allowance,</b> overtime-withpay and piece-rate among indigenous firms. Certain of the non-financial incentives could however be combined to reinforce the effect of financial based incentives, this tends to nullify the dis-satisfier factors that impedes productivity. To this end however, non-financial incentives the likes of: social security, conducive, accident free work environment, involvement in decision making and prompt payment of wages could be a potential high productivity inducer, if well administered and managed. This was based on the respondent’s preference for the administration of non-financial incentives. The presence of these as garnered from the respondent’s response accounts for the wide margin between foreign firms and indigenous firm’s productivit...|$|E

40|$|Background: Community {{health workers}} (CHWs) have been {{employed}} {{in a number}} of low- and middle-income countries as part of primary health care strategies, but the packages vary across and even within countries. The experiences and motivations of a multipurpose CHW in providing maternal and newborn health have not been well described. Objective: This study examined the perceptions of community members and experiences of CHWs around promoting maternal and newborn care practices, and the self-identified factors that influence the performance of CHWs so as to inform future study design and programme implementation. Design: Data were collected using in-depth interviews with six local council leaders, ten health workers/CHW supervisors, and eight mothers. We conducted four focus group discussions with CHWs. Respondents included 14 urban and 18 rural CHWs. Key themes explored included the experience of CHWs according to their various roles, and the facilitators and barriers they encounter in their work particular to provision of maternal and newborn care. Qualitative data were analysed using manifest content analysis methods. Results: CHWs were highly appreciated in the community and seen as important contributors to maternal and newborn health at grassroots level. Factors that positively influence CHWs included being selected by and trained in the community; being trained in problem-solving skills; being deployed immediately after training with participation of local leaders; frequent supervision; and having a strengthened and responsive supply of services to which families can be referred. CHWs made use of social networks to identify pregnant and newly delivered women, and were able to target men and the wider family during health education activities. Intrinsic motivators (e. g. community appreciation and the prestige of being ‘a doctor’), monetary (such as a small <b>transport</b> <b>allowance),</b> and material incentives (e. g. bicycles, bags) were also important to varying degrees. Conclusions: There is a continued role for CHWs in improving maternal and newborn care and linking families with health services. However, the process for building CHW programmes needs to be adapted to the local setting, including the process of training, deployment, supervision, and motivation {{within the context of a}} responsive and available health system...|$|E

The Lipinyapinya Institute of Education (LIE) was used as a case study for the study. The study examined the extent to which the identified challenges affect the performance of the academic staff. Further, the study assessed the measures taken by LIE staff and the government to address the challenges. The study was conducted at the LIE headquarters in Dar es Salam. The sample included 50 respondents. The respondents were LIE senior administrators and MoEVT adult education officers who were selected through a purposive sampling technique. Academic staff, Diploma and Bachelor of Adult and continuing Education (BACE) students were obtained through random sampling technique. Data was collected through qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The data collection techniques used in the study included interviews, questionnaires, observation and documentary review. Findings revealed that academic staff at LIE faced challenges such as shortage of teaching and learning materials and facilities, inconducive teaching and learning environment, unattractive allowances and unavailability of house allowance. Other challenges that were found out included unreliable transport and lack of staff development policy. It was revealed that shortage of funds from Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT) and donors, mismanagement of funds, poor application of ICT and low profile accorded to the field of adult education at the MoEVT were some of the causes of the challenges encountered.

40|$|Motivation: We {{present a}} method for {{inferring}} and constructing transport reactions for transporter proteins based primarily on {{the analysis of the}} names of individual proteins in the genome annotation of an organism. Transport reactions are declarative descriptions of transporter activities, and thus can be manipulated computationally, unlike free-text protein names. Once transporter activities are encoded as transport reactions, a number of computational analyses are possible including database queries by transporter activity; inclusion of transporters into an automatically generated metabolic-map diagram that can be painted with omics data to aid in their interpretation; detection of anomalies in the metabolic and transport networks, such as substrates that are transported into the cell but are not inputs to any metabolic reaction or pathway; and comparative analyses of the transport capabilities of different organisms. Results: On randomly selected organisms, the method achieves precision and recall rates of 0. 93 and 0. 90, respectively in identifying transporter proteins by name within the complete genome. The method obtains 67. 5 % accuracy in predicting complete <b>transport</b> reactions; if <b>allowance</b> is made for predictions that are overly general yet not incorrect, reaction prediction accuracy is 82. 5 %.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{temporary}} workers in organisations is {{for different reasons}} such as cost-savings and improvement of {{the flexibility of the}} workforce. The choice of using temporary workers instead of regular or full-time workers is driven mainly by the desire for competitiveness and success. Business organisations are willing to use temporary workers as efficiently and effectively as possible to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage. However, not all the companies using temporary workers are achieving competitive advantages. This research investigates the effective use of labour brokers by an engineering company. The aim is to find out the truth about the matter and make recommendations that will help the company utilise temporary employment services (TES) efficiently and effectively in order to compete successfully in the market. A qualitative research design was followed as a data collection technique or data analysis procedure that helped in the generation of data for the research. One-on-one interviews were conducted with four temporary workers placed in the company by the labour brokers and five workers who were placed by the labour broker but who have recently been employed permanently by the company. In addition a Human Resources (HR) Manager of the company was also interviewed about using the labour brokers’ and the reasons for choosing to use them. The Manager representing the labour broker supplying the company with workers was also interviewed. Having searched and carefully studied literature, and conducted research on the identified engineering company a conclusion was reached that the company sources all types of workers from TES to fill in vacancies left by permanent staff as well as employees who are temporarily absent from work due to illness, maternity leaves and other short-term absences. In addition the company is paying short-term employees the same rate as long-term employees. These employees also enjoy overtime work at the same rate, the shift allowances, and the inconvenience allowance like their permanent counterparts. However, temporary employees sourced from TES do not have all benefits that are enjoyed by the permanent workers such as medical aid, housing allowance, <b>transport</b> <b>allowance,</b> retained services allowance, and company-based rate of pay for all weekly-paid staff. TES pays the employees that are sourced to the company with the money that the company gives to it depending on hours worked and the rate of pay per hour.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with school inspection in Tanzania. The main aim was to explore {{the extent to which}} school inspection has an impact upon teaching and learning in Tanzanian primary schools and to give some insights into how it might be organised to influence teachers’ work performance. The theoretical framework was grounded on the Scientific Management, Human Relations and Critical theories with the argument that though teachers have to follow pre-determined objectives in a refined curriculum, they possess potential independent thinking that can shape their teaching and learning for pupils’ academic excellence hence, a sense of emancipation and ownership of the process. The study was essentially qualitative with some aspects of a quantitative approach and it employed 59 participants. These were 50 teachers, 8 school inspectors and 1 district education officer. Empirical data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and from documentary evidence. The findings indicated that school inspection plays a potential role towards improving teaching and learning. Teachers perceived the advice and feedback given through inspection reports and recommendations useful for making improvements in their work performance. However, the study found that inspections reports and recommendations were not acted upon by the respective authorities to bring about effective impact on teaching and learning. It was also found that, to a greater extent school inspectors had succeeded in establishing positive relations with teachers. The majority of teachers stated that school inspectors used friendly language when discussing with them. The study further revealed that, school inspectors judged the performance of the schools based on schemes of work, lesson plans and pupils’ exercise books, whereas classroom observations were not effectively carried out. It was also found that school inspectors’ working conditions were poor. For example, they did not have a means of <b>transport</b> nor field <b>allowances</b> to facilitate their visits in schools. From the above findings, the study recommends the government to commit its resources towards school inspectorate department for effective monitoring of the quality education provided. Classroom observations should be a central focus of the school inspectors for their impact on teaching/learning to be realised. Moreover, for improvements in teaching and learning to be achieved the director and the DEO should make use of the inspection findings and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} how a social citizenship {{for people with disabilities}} is shaped bythe normative structures in the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian law governing their right to transportin everyday life. The thesis deals with three types of transport provided by the public to private individuals: <b>transport</b> services, car <b>allowances,</b> and cash benefits for reimbursing transport costs forpeople with disabilities. For each provision, the focus of the study is directed by the followingquestions: – Is there a rights/duties relationship between the public and the individual? Who is eligible forprovision? How does public funding impact entitlement? Who is obliged to provide? What are thelegal guarantees for entitlement? Despite objectives within Nordic law and policy that people with disabilities should be compensated for their impairments, and allowed to lead independent and autonomous lives, the results from the thesis show that the various transport provisions do not fully realize this. The legal relations between the public and those with needs for transport in their everyday lives are characterized by control, scrutiny and questioning. In order to protect the public budgets from costs, the eligibility criteria in the law are so constructed as to ensure that only certain needs for transport, and only some impairments, can meet them. The national, regional and municipal governments, and the administrative courts, subject people with disabilities to intrusive inquiries regarding personal details and other circumstances in their lives, {{in order to be able}} to judge which needs for transport are to be considered legitimate and which are not. The thesis shows that the individual rights to, especially, Swedish and Norwegian transport provisions are poorly protected against political decisions to cut funding. Local and regional self-governance isan interest that always competes with individual legal rights and make them weaker, irrespective of whether these rights can be appealed in administrative courts. The conclusion in the thesis highlights how a social citizenship is shaped in the law governing the right to transport for people with disabilities, and that this social citizenship does not reinforce independence and individual autonomy for those who are dependent on the various provisions tomeet their needs for transport in their everyday lives...|$|R
