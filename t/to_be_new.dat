5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E

The very event and composition of the new Cabinet caused widespread condemnation throughout Europe but only Britain and the Netherlands decided to break off diplomatic relations with Serbia.

25|$|The Flatiron Building, {{designed}} by Daniel Hudson Burnham and standing 285ft (87m) high, {{was one of}} the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its steel skeleton. It {{was one of the}} first buildings designed with a steel framework, and to achieve this height with other construction methods of that time would have been very difficult. (The Tower Building, {{designed by}} Bradford Gilbert and built in 1889, is considered by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>New</b> York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame, while the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its steel skeleton).

25|$|A {{road rage}} {{incident}} {{on the side}} of the highway led to the death of Richard Aderson in 1997. Aderson, an assistant superintendent at the Valley Central School District in Montgomery, was returning to his LaGrange home on the evening of February5, 1997, when he had a minor collision with a relatively new green Jeep Cherokee carrying what appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire license plates just before crossing the NewburghBeacon Bridge. The two drivers pulled over near exit12, and after a brief argument the other driver shot Aderson and left the scene. Aderson was able to give the 9-1-1 operator he called on his cell phone a description of his assailant and the vehicle before dying at the scene. A police sketch based on Aderson's description has been widely circulated and is still posted prominently in kiosks at the freeway's rest areas. The case has been dramatized on both America's Most Wanted and Unsolved Mysteries, generating many leads since then but remains open.|$|E
25|$|The 1901 {{mutation}} {{theory of}} evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly {{as a result of}} environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. Its originator was the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries. De Vries looked for evidence of mutation extensive enough to produce a new species in a single generation and thought he found it with his work breeding the evening primrose of the genus Oenothera, which he started in 1886. The plants that de Vries worked with seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>new</b> species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents. DeVries himself allowed a role for natural selection in determining which new species would survive, but some geneticists influenced by his work, including Morgan, felt that natural selection was not necessary at all. De Vries's ideas were influential in the first two decades of the 20th century, as some biologists felt that mutation theory could explain the sudden emergence of new forms in the fossil record; research on Oenothera spread across the world. However, critics including many field naturalists wondered why no other organism seemed to show the same kind of rapid mutation.|$|E
