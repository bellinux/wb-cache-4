5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature composed of <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies and <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Peers, a press that would enjoy {{a degree of}} freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain {{in the hands of}} their current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to <b>the</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E
50|$|Originally, while ministers were legally {{responsible}} to <b>the</b> <b>Chambers,</b> they were politically responsible to the King. However, {{as the power}} and prestige of <b>the</b> <b>Chambers</b> grew over <b>the</b> years, it became virtually impossible for a King to appoint a ministry entirely of his own choosing, or keep it in office against the express will of <b>the</b> <b>Chambers.</b> As a result, {{notwithstanding the provisions of}} the Statute, it became a well-established convention that ministers were both legally and politically responsible to <b>the</b> <b>Chambers.</b> In fact, this convention was so strongly established that in 1925, Mussolini had to pass a law which specifically stated that he was not responsible to <b>the</b> <b>Chambers.</b>|$|R

5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. <b>The</b> <b>chamber</b> was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. <b>The</b> <b>chamber</b> was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> in two. Furthermore, within <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E
5|$|Within <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> {{were placed}} human remains, {{which have been}} {{discovered}} and removed at intervals during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries.

5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E

5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. <b>The</b> <b>chamber</b> originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through <b>the</b> <b>chamber,</b> where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chambers</b> were {{generally}} 28 ft to 40 ft span, and 150 ft to 200 ft long, {{and in every}} case were connected at their ends by a small section tunnel called a 'back drive'.
