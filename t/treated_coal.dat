40|$|The {{effect of}} acidic or basic {{pre-treatment}} on the adsorption capacity of CO 2 on coals was investigated. Argonne Premium Pocahontas No. 3, Upper Freeport, Pittsburgh No. 8, Lewiston-Stockton, Blind Canyon, Illinois No. 6, Wyodak, and Beulah-Zap coals were washed in weak solutions of H 2 SO 4 and NaOH to the pH values of 10, 7, and 2, {{after an initial}} washing in acidic water. Attempts to treat the Wyodak and Beulah-Zap coals were unsuccessful because the base treatment after the initial acid treatment resulted in a suspension which could be separated neither via filtration through a 45 μm filter nor centrifugation. Equilibration took several days in some cases, although the as-received coal had been ground to 150 μm. Acid washing preferentially removed Ca (calcite) and Mg. Aluminosilicate clays were not notably removed. Iron was removed in significant amounts only after base treatment, possibly after it was converted to hematite. The adsorption capacity of CO 2 on the acid <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> was higher than both the base <b>treated</b> and untreated <b>coals.</b> The difference in adsorption capacities for acid and base <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> {{was related to the}} pore sizes and mineral matter removal from the coals, where the calculated average pore size was higher for acid <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> than for the base <b>treated</b> <b>coals.</b> It is concluded that the pH decrease due to CO 2 dissolution in cleat water is favored in coal seam sequestration, which resulted in an increase in storage capacity of coals...|$|R

The ILs used were 1 -butylpyridinium chloride ([Bpyd][Cl]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([Emim][DCM]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]), and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide ([Bmim][TCM]). Visual comparisons were made between the raw and IL-treated coals via optical microscopy. Changes in thermal behavior of these <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> were compared against raw coals via pyrolysis experiments in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Changes in functional group composition in the <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> were probed via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The recovered ILs were also analyzed via FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies to observe any changes after recovery. Low-temperature IL treatment {{of each of the}} coals resulted in fragmentation and fracturing, reducing the average particle size. An increase in mass loss in the <b>treated</b> <b>coals</b> was also observed when compared to each raw coal, indicating an increase in lower molecular weight fragments after treatment. This was corroborated by a large increase in aliphatic hydrocarbons being observed in the <b>treated</b> <b>coals,</b> along with a decrease in oxygenated functional groups and mineral matter in one coal.

The SBNR performance was improved with the increasing of COD and TP removal efficiency via PACT. The average removal efficiencies of COD and TP in PACT were respectively 85. 80 % and 90. 30 %. Meanwhile, the NH 3 –N to NO 2 –N conversion rate was achieved 86. 89 % in SBNR and the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was 75. 54 %. In contrast, the AOB in SBNR was significantly inhibited without PACT or with poor performance of PACT in advance, which rendered the removal of TN.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} report is to measure the {{diffusion}} coefficients at temperatures about 20 - 27 degreesC, {{the activation energies of}} diffusion, and to determine the type of transport mechanism of diffusion of pyridine in macromolecular structure of Turkish Elbistan lignite (C: 53. 0 wt %, dmmf). The raw coal sample was demineralized with HCl and HF by standard methods. The raw and demineralized coal samples were extracted with pyridine. Pyridine uptake of the coal samples was recorded at temperatures 20 - 27 degreesC in an adiabatic setup until a constant weight was attained. The extent of swelling of original and <b>treated</b> <b>coal</b> samples in pyridine were measured. Pyridine extraction created a fraction of enlarged particle size due to irreversible solvent swelling. The diffusion coefficients were measured from the slope of graphs of M-t/M-infinity versus t(1 / 2) The diffusion of pyridine in the raw coal seemed to be less, compared to those of the <b>treated</b> <b>coal</b> samples. Extraction of the raw coal with pyridine extended the pyridine diffusion in the coal very little. The formation of new carboxylic acid groups in acid-washed samples enhanced diffusion of pyridine. In all of the samples the diffusion constants increased linearly with an increase in the temperature. The greater diffusion coefficients are encountered with the coal samples which swelled more in pyridine. It seemed that the diffusion coefficients increased with swelling and acid washings as a result of structural variations decreasing the activation energy of diffusion of the solvent to the coal. The transport mechanism of pyridine in the macromolecular coal network of Elbistan lignite was not relaxation controlled. The diffusion of pyridine in the low rank Elbistan lignite obeyed generally Fickian mechanism or an intermediate case of Fickian-anomalous mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Unlike other {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) storage options, CO 2 storage in coal seams {{is still in}} its infancy, and one of the many {{questions}} that need to be answered concerns the long term effects of storing CO 2 in coal specifically on the structure and properties of the coal. Most studies on coal structural changes due to CO 2 adsorption have been done over the period of adsorption (hours or 2 - 3 days), and mostly at low pressures which are not representative of actual storage conditions. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine chemical and physical changes that might occur due to long term interaction of coal with CO 2 under pressurised conditions. Air dried coal samples of different maceral groups (vitrinite and inertinite) were exposed to CO 2 in reactors under subcritical and supercritical conditions for different period of time (up to 6 months). The samples were well characterised pre- and post-CO 2 treatment. A newly-built high-pressure volumetric system was used for adsorption and desorption isotherms measurements of the coals before CO 2 sorption. The characterisation techniques used were BET, XRD, FTIR and 13 C NMR. Surface area analysis of untreated and <b>treated</b> <b>coal</b> particles showed that vitrinite-rich coal samples have a greater surface area and pore size distribution change in pore structure following CO 2 treatment than the inertinite-rich coal particles. Analysis of the crystalline part of the CO 2 untreated and treated inertinite-rich particles showed that there was slight increase in the average crystallite height following CO 2 treatment, although no changes were observed for the d 002 aromatic interplanar spacing. In comparing the effects of subcritical and supercritical treatment on CO 2 sorption behaviour over time, the study determined that the long term effects of CO 2 storage in coal were found to be dependent on the maceral composition of the coal, with the vitrinite-rich coal showing a more pronounced structural and properties change after CO 2 storage. This change did, however, differ under subcritical and supercritical conditions. The adsorption capacity of the supercritical <b>treated</b> <b>coal</b> was found to be lower than the subcritical <b>treated</b> <b>coal</b> over the same period of 6 months for the vitrinite-rich coal. Inertinite-rich coal was found to be less prone to changes under CO 2 storage. A major implication of this finding is the inclusion of maceral composition as major criteria for determining CO 2 storage in coal capability. The results in this study contribute significantly to the understanding of coal-CO 2 interactions and the implications for coal structure and properties changes; the results could be used by decision-makers on the effects of storing CO 2 in coal...|$|E

The overall biological treatment generates these changes probably due to the oxidation process. Concerning organic sulphur biodesulphurization there is no change in any drastic mannerof the thermal characteristic parameters. In general, applied biotreatments provoke a complex influence on combustion coal behaviour. From one side a better ignition performance, a minor decrease in higher heating value and diminishing peak temperature of maximum weight loss rate for all biotreated samples are observed. From other side some decrease in the combustibility indicated by an increase in the combustion time and the end of combustion temperature are obvious.
