40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} two potential beneficial management practices that will reduce the impact of fecal and fertilizers contamination on the environment. The study was conducted in Eastern Ontario on typical small scale agricultural practices. The first part evaluates the impact of a conventional pasture system and an excluding pasture system on surface water quality. The three year study compared water quality endpoints such as: indicator bacteria, pathogens, parasites and nutrients between treatments. Microbial source tracking indicated that livestock was the main source of fecal contamination in the stream. Greater bacteria and nutrient loads were observed in the unrestricted pasture system than the excluding pasture. Moreover, parasite and indicator bacteria concentrations increased after cattle introduction in both systems. The second part compares nitrogen mass balance between managed and conventional subsurface <b>tile</b> <b>drainage.</b> Over two years, nitrogen loads in groundwater, in tile flow, in plants, in soil and denitrification were compared between treatments. Nitrogen was mostly removed from managed <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>fields</b> through plant uptake. Compared to nitrogen plant uptake, denitrification, the second greatest nitrogen removing process was 10 times smaller. The denitrification was greater in the unmanaged <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>fields.</b> Generally, managed subsurface <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> reduces nitrogen mass loads to surface waters and increases nitrogen uptake by plant, which resulted in greater yields...|$|R

40|$|Controlled <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> (CTD) is a {{management}} practice designed to retain water and nutrients {{in the field}} for crop use. CTD has shown promise for improving water quality and augmenting crop yields but findings are often restricted to field and plot scales. Remote sensing is one of the alternatives to evaluate crop responsiveness to CTD at large spatial scales. This study compared normalized and green normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI and GNDVI) for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) among CTD and uncontrolled <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> (UCTD) <b>fields</b> in a ~ 950 Â ha experimental watershed setting in Ontario, Canada from 2005 to 2008. The indices were derived from Landsat- 5 and SPOT- 4 satellite imagery. Log-transformed NDVI and GNDVI for soybean (R 3 -R 6 growth stage) and corn (VT to R 5 -R 6 growth stage) crops were higher significantly (pÂ  Â CTD). Log-transformed NDVI and GNDVI standard errors for CTD, relative to UCTD fields, were lower for 65 % of the significant corn and 71 % of the significant soybean NDVI and GNDVI comparisons for the growth stages noted above. This finding suggested overall more uniform crop growth for CTD fields relative to UCTD fields. Observed yields from a subset of commonly managed CTD and UCTD fields in the study area were not significantly different from each other (pÂ >Â  0. 05) with respect to <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> management practice; however, 87 % of these paired yield comparisons indicated that CTD mean corn/soybean grain yields were {{greater than or equal to}} those for UCTD. On average, CTD observed corn and soybean grain yields were 3 % and 4 %, respectively, greater than those from UCTD. From observed yield and NDVI and GNDVI observations, vegetation indices vs. yield linear regression models were developed to predict grain yields over a broader land base in the experimental watershed area. Here, predicted mean yields were 0. 1 - 11 % higher for CTD corn and - 5 % to 4 % higher for CTD soybean, relative to UCTD crops; but results varied between manured and non-manured fertilizer practices. Eighty-nine percent of the standard deviations for these yield predictions were lower for CTD relative to UCTD. The results of this study indicate that at a minimum, CTD did not adversely impact corn and soybean grain yields over the time span and field environments of the study, and based on the weight of evidence presented here, CTD shows general promise for augmenting crop performance.

The second main objective was to study the influence of WTM on grain corn yields. Two drainage treatments were compared: conventional free drainage and WTM (combined controlled drainage and subirrigation) with a design water table depth at 0. 6 m below the ground surface. <b>Tile</b> <b>drainage</b> and surface runoff were monitored and sampled automatically. Increased outflow volumes and concentrations - and therefore increased P loads - were measured in drainage water from plots under WTM. Plots under WTM also generally exhibited higher P loads in surface runoff. Higher P concentrations in surface runoff from plots under WTM were observed in surface runoff, especially during winter. Phosphorus loads from combined <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> and surface runoff were low compared with literature data (< 0. 4 kg/ha/year). However, the mean P concentrations in <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> were above Quebec's surface water quality standard of 0. 03 mg total P/L during both growing seasons in plots under WTM, but not in plots with conventional free drainage. Mean P concentrations in surface runoff water routinely exceeded the criteria, except in plots with conventional free drainage in winter 2002. Therefore, P from <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> and surface runoff could contribute to the eutrophication of surface water. Based on these results, WTM increases P loads from the <b>field,</b> both in <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> and surface runoff. However, the well water used for subirrigation was found to contain P concentrations above Quebec's surface water quality standard, and this could partly explain the higher P concentrations found in water from plots under WTM.

It was concluded that the woodchips were an effective means to sorb the veterinary antibiotics leached into the tile water after application of animal manure. Linear partition coefficients were calculated and phase distribution relationships were established for both the chemicals. The fresh woodchips gave inconclusive data but predictions could be made by the information determined in the experiments using woodchips from a ten year old woodchip bioreactor. Desorption was also studied and the likelihood of desorption was predicted using the Apparent Hysteresis Index. Overall, {{it was found that the}} old woodchips allowed for quick sorption of both antibiotics. It was also found that SMZ had reversible sorption on old woodchips. Thus, it was concluded that the woodchip bioreactor would not be effective for removal of veterinary antibiotics from <b>tile</b> <b>drainage.</b> More research is required for the fate of TYL and to confirm the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{security}} and sustainability require {{a suite of}} biomass crops, including woody species. Short rotation woody crops (SRWCs) such as Populus have great potential as biofuel feedstocks. Quantifying biomass yields of bioenergy crop and hydrologic and water quality responses to growth is important should it be widely planted in the Midwestern U. S. Subsurface <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> systems enable the Midwest area to become highly productive agricultural lands, but also create environmental problems like nitrate-N contamination of the water it drains. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) {{has been used to}} model watersheds with <b>tile</b> <b>drainage,</b> but the new <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routine in SWAT 2012 has not been fully tested. ^ The objectives of this study were to develop algorithms and growth parameters of Populus in Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) and SWAT models, compare performance of <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routines in SWAT 2009 and SWAT 2012 in simulating <b>tile</b> <b>drainage,</b> and simulate biomass yields of bioenergy crops and the impacts of their impacts on water quantity and quality for a typical tile-drained watershed in the Midwest USA. ^ The functional components and parameters of hybrid poplar Tristis # 1 (Populus balsamifera L. × P. tristis Fisch) and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) were determined, and related algorithms improved in ALMANAC and SWAT based on improved simulation of leaf area, plant biomass and biomass partitioning. Long-term (1991 - 2003) field site and river station data from the Little Vermilion River (LVR) watershed in Illinois were used to evaluate performance of <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routines in SWAT 2009 revision 528 (the old routine) and SWAT 2012 revision 615 and 645 (the new routine). Calibrated monthly tile flow, surface flow, nitrate in tile and surface flow, sediment and annual corn and soybean yield results at field sites, and flow, sediment load and nitrate load at the river station for the old and new <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routines were compared with observed values. Crop residue from corn stover, perennial grasses, switchgrass and Miscanthus, and hybrid poplar trees were considered as potential bioenergy crops for the LVR watershed. SWAT 2012 (Revision 615) with the new <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routine (DRAINMOD routine) and improved perennial grass and tree growth simulation was used to model long-term annual biomass yields, flow, tile flow, sediment load, total nitrogen, nitrate load in flow, nitrate in tile flow, soluble nitrogen, organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, mineral phosphorus and organic phosphorus under various bioenergy scenarios in the LVR watershed. Simulated results from different bioenergy crop scenarios were compared with those from the baseline. ^ Tree growth calibration and validation results showed that improved algorithms of leaf area index (LAI) and biomass simulation and suggested values and potential parameter range for hybrid poplar Tristis # 1 and Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) were reasonable, and performance of the modified ALMANAC in simulating LAI, aboveground biomass and root biomass of Populus was good. Performance of the modified SWAT simulated hybrid poplar LAI and aboveground woody biomass (PBIAS: - 57 ~ 7 %, NSE: 0. 94 ~ 0. 99, and R 2 : 0. 74 ~ 0. 99), and cottonwood aboveground biomass, seasonal mean runoff, mean sediment, mean nitrate-N and total nitrate-N were satisfactory (PBIAS: - 39 ~ 11 %, NSE: 0. 86 ~ 0. 99, and R 2 : 0. 93 ~ 0. 99). Additionally, <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> calibration and validation results indicated that the new routine provides acceptable simulated tile flow (NSE = 0. 50 ~ 0. 68), and nitrate in tile flow (NSE = 0. 50 ~ 0. 77) for field sites, while the old routine simulated tile flow (NSE = - 0. 77 ~ - 0. 20) and nitrate in tile flow (NSE = - 0. 99 ~ 0. 21) for the field site with constant tile spacing were unacceptable. The new modified curve number calculation method in revision 645 (NSE = 0. 56 ~ 0. 82) better simulated surface runoff than revision 615 (NSE = - 5. 95 ~ 0. 5). Bioenergy crop simulation results showed that 38 % corn stover removal (66, 439 Mg/yr) with combination of Miscanthus both on highly erodible areas and marginal land (19, 039 Mg/yr) provided the highest biofeedstock production. Flow, tile flow, erosion and nutrient losses were slightly reduced under bioenergy crop scenarios of Miscanthus, switchgrass, and hybrid poplar on highly erodible areas, marginal land and marginal land with forest. The increase in sediment load and nutrient losses resulting from corn stover removal could be offset under scenarios with various combinations of bioenergy crops. Corn stover removal with bioenergy crops both on highly erodible areas and marginal land could provide more biofuel production relative to the baseline, and was beneficial to hydrology and water quality at the watershed scale. ^ The modified ALMANAC and SWAT can be used for biofeedstock production modeling for Populus. The modified SWAT model can be used for Populus biofeedstock production modeling and hydrologic and water quality response to its growth. The improved algorithms of LAI and biomass simulation for tree growth should also be useful for other process based models, such as SWAT, EPIC and APEX. <b>Tile</b> <b>drainage</b> calibration and validation results provided reasonable parameter sets for the old and new <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> routines to accurately simulate hydrologic processes in mildly-sloped watersheds. Bioenergy crop simulation results provided guidance for further research on evaluation of bioenergy crop scenarios in a typical extensively tile-drained watershed in the Midwestern US. ...|$|R
