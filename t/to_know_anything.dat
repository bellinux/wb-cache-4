25|$|Reformed theologians {{believe that}} God {{communicates}} knowledge of himself to {{people through the}} Word of God. People are not able <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about God except through this self-revelation. Speculation about anything which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God {{is different from that}} which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} matroid is a matroid {{together with}} a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be {{the sum of the}} weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum-weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about the details of the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E
25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything?</b> Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it, he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E

500|$|On 14 and 15 April 1993, Holland was {{the mission}} {{commander}} of a two-ship training mission to a bombing range near Guam in the Pacific Ocean. During the mission, Holland flew his B-52 {{closer to the}} other B-52 than regulations allowed. Holland also asked his navigator to videotape the bombs falling from the aircraft from inside the bomb bay, also against regulations. Holland's navigator later brought the video {{to the attention of}} three Fairchild USAF officers. The first, Lieutenant Colonel Bullock, the current 325th Bomb Squadron commander, did not do anything about it and may have even tried to use the videotape as leverage to coerce the navigator into accepting a position as mission scheduler for the wing. The second, the deputy operations group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harper, told the crew member to conceal the evidence. The third, the DO, allegedly responded to reports of the video by stating, [...] "Okay, I don't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about that video—I don't care." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

[...] The casting director had Durand read a page of dialogue for the new character Keamy; Durand was offered the role in early October and he traveled to Honolulu in Hawaii—where Lost is filmed on location—by October 17, 2007. [...] A former stand-up comic and rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, with the stage name [...] "Kevy D", Durand had seen only around six episodes of Lost by the time that he won the part. [...] When he was shooting, he was confused by the story, later stating [...] "I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> or be attached to anybody. [...] I'm glad I didn't. [...] But now that I'm on it, I'll watch all of it." [...] Durand revealed his appreciation for the cast, crew and scripts and the fact that he had the chance to act as someone with a similar physical appearance to himself, as he had previously done roles that had not prompted recognition from viewers on the street.|$|E

The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds?
