5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In <b>them,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Bunce Island was {{designated}} Sierra Leone's first officially protected historic site. The same year, Sierra Leonean amateur historian and medical doctor M.C.F. Easmon led an expedition that cleared the vegetation, mapped the ruins and photographed <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Research {{at the island}} has been underway since the 1970s.

25|$|These {{are similar}} to the {{well-known}} licences, in that they're defined before their use and can be applied to many instances of licensing. Their difference is that as they're not well known, it's also necessary to explain what each of them entails, as the user is always likely to be encountering each of <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> A REL provides the means to do this.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 1963, he headlined at the Paris Olympia, a {{sign that}} he had arrived. At the end of that year, François created {{original}} new dance steps, and Michel Bourdais drew <b>them.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> they brought up the idea of setting up a show with female dancers.

It departed the museum for Locomotion, the NRM's outbase at Shildon on 23 June 2010, where it was a static exhibit, until it was hauled back to York on 19 July 2011 and put back on display in its original location in the Great Hall.|$|E
25|$|Sheep flight {{behavior}} is cited in one major study in California {{as the major}} stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in coyotes. Even coyotes that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Of particular interest was that coyotes with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The coyotes were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these coyotes were not hungry. The same study also determined that dominant coyotes {{were more likely to}} attack sheep.|$|E
25|$|In 1795 Fraser made a {{first visit}} to Saint Petersburg where he sold a choice {{collection}} of plants to the Empress Catherine; to his delight she requested he set his own price. While there, he bought Black and White Tartarian cherries in 1796, thereafter introducing <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> to England. In 1797 Czar Paul I ordered that Fraser be paid 4,000 rubles for his plants that year, and by the next spring, Fraser had received £500 sterling for his efforts. In 1798 Fraser travelled again to Russia, returning afterward with the commission Botanical Collector to the Emperor Paul, under the signature of each Paul and Catherine and dated Pavlovskoe, August, 1798.|$|E
50|$|Eyehategod {{have noted}} Melvins, Carnivore, The Obsessed, Discharge, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Confessor and Saint Vitus as key {{influences}} to their sound. Heavy, detuned, and bluesy guitar riffs dominate the band's discography. They are combined with walls of feedback and tortured vocals {{to create a}} harsh misanthropic vibe. The band was friends with Anal Cunt and performed with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> show after their frontman Seth Putnam {{came out of his}} coma.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} attempt at American distribution, the producers created a dub {{under the direction}} of veteran voice director Jack Fletcher. However, when the anime was picked up by TOKYOPOP and prepared for its 2003 release as Reign: The Conqueror, another dub was created. Still, TOKYOPOP retained the rights to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> four episodes of the series containing Fletcher's original dub, and used <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> four episodes of the American release. It used <b>the</b> second dub <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining episodes.|$|R
50|$|Over {{a century}} earlier, {{an attempt to}} colonize Junior had failed.

25|$|Effective 14 January 2013, Cuba {{ended the}} {{requirement}} established in 1961, that any citizens {{who wish to}} travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation. In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution; it approved exit visas only on rare occasions. Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and {{they are allowed to}} take their young children with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad {{are most likely to be}} able to take advantage of the new policy. In the first year of the program, over 180,000 left Cuba and returned.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2001–02, Liverpool had {{finished}} above Everton in the league for 15 seasons in succession, but 2002–03 saw Everton showing signs of eclipsing <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in years. After a brilliant run of form saw Liverpool top the Premier League in October, an 11-match winless league run followed their 2–0 home win over West Ham United in early November and during that barren spell they drew 0–0 at home to an Everton side who were actually above them and looking like qualifying for Europe after several seasons of persistent relegation battles. However, they were on course for their fifth-place finish when they next met Everton on 19 April and won 1–2 at Goodison Park, a result which pushed their city neighbours towards seventh place and narrowly deprived them of European football.|$|E
500|$|The cast did {{the first}} of three table {{readings}} in May 2005, and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation, and was {{concerned by the}} continuity issues that {{the events in the}} episode presented, such as why Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) didn't have a record of Archer and the crew's encounter with some nameless technologically enhanced aliens who assimilated people when he met <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in [...] "Q Who". She thought that there were good performances by Linda Park and John Billingsley, but thought that Billingsley as Phlox could have been more emotionally affected by his partial assimilation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four, saying that it was [...] "a deviously clever premise, with the best-executed action of the season", but that the show was [...] "doing itself few favors by reaching into the obvious Trekkian bag of tricks".

500|$|Also in Traveling Shoes, Angelou came {{to terms}} with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendent of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced racism. [...] As she told an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand <b>them.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in Angelou's life, she did not [...] "feel threatened by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in Traveling Shoes, but she has matured in the way she dealt with it. As Hagen stated, Angelou was [...] "not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". This was demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that has often been overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. [...] Angelou was taught an important lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compared it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts was needed to overcome it.|$|E
