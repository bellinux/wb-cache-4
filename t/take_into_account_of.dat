60|$|Twelve {{flowers on}} some plants in my flower-garden were fertilised with pollen from {{distinct}} plants, and produced twelve capsules; {{but one of}} these contained no good seed. The seeds of the eleven good capsules weighed 17.4 grains. Eighteen flowers on the same plants were fertilised with their own pollen and produced twelve good capsules, which contained 13.61 grains weight of seed. Therefore {{an equal number of}} crossed and self-fertilised capsules would have yielded seed by weight as 100 to 71. (4/4. Professor Hildebrand experimented on plants in Germany on a larger scale than I did, and found them much more self-fertile. Eighteen capsules, produced by cross-fertilisation, contained on an average eighty-five seeds, whilst fourteen capsules from self-fertilised flowers contained on an average only nine seeds; that is, as 100 to 11: 'Jahrb. fur Wissen Botanik.' B. 7 page 467.) If we <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the fact that a much greater proportion of flowers produced capsules when crossed than when self-fertilised, the relative fertility of the crossed to the self-fertilised flowers was as 100 to 52. Nevertheless these plants, whilst still protected by the net, spontaneously produced a considerable number of self-fertilised capsules.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} efficiency and amount of CYP2D6 enzyme produced between individuals. Hence for drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 (that is, are CYP2D6 substrates), certain individuals will eliminate these drugs quickly (ultrarapid metabolizers) while others slowly (poor metabolizers).

50|$|As {{listed above}} direct impacts such as noise and carbon {{monoxide}} emissions create direct and harmful {{effects on the}} environment, along with indirect impacts. The indirect impacts are often of higher consequence {{which leads to the}} misconception that it’s the opposite since it is frequently understood that initial effects cause the most damage. For example, particulates which are the outcome of incomplete combustion done by an internal combustion engine, are not linked with respiratory and cardiovascular problems since they contribute to other factors not only to that specific condition. Even though the environmental impacts are usually listed individually there are also cumulative impacts. The synergetic consequences of transport activities.

50|$|In {{attempting}} {{to address these}} concerns and {{on the heels of}} the controversial Law decision, scholars proposed various alternatives to the human dignity test. It was widely accepted that the s. 15 claims were inadequately addressed using the previous formulations following Andrews, yet the Court’s decision in Law was seen as inadequately addressing these concerns. One writer argued that the Court should replace the human dignity test with a “reformulated grounds approach focused on human vulnerability and concrete human interests” that would be focused on individual and group vulnerability and which would <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> a variety of factors, including the four enumerated contextual factors of the human dignity test. Another proposed an increased focus on the concept of accommodation, as this should, in any case, be the central focus of any s. 15 claim. Yet another critic of the human dignity test proposed an understanding of human dignity reformulated as a concept of personal autonomy, an approach more favorable to empirical analyses and thus more coherent, and which is substantiated in part by the Supreme Court’s own definition of human dignity.|$|E
50|$|While all page {{replacement}} algorithms rely on {{existence of}} reference locality to function, {{a major difference}} among different replacement algorithms is on how this locality is qualified. LIRS uses reuse distance of a page, {{or the number of}} distinct pages accessed between two consecutive references of the page, to quantify locality. Specifically, LIRS uses last and second-to-last references (if any) for this purpose. If a page is accessed for the first time, its reuse distance is infinite. In contrast, LRU uses recency of a page, which is the number of distinctive pages accessed after the reference of the page, to quantify locality. To <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> up-to-date access history, the implementation of LIRS actually uses the larger of reuse distance and recency of a page as the metric to quantify its locality, denoted as RD-R. Assuming the cache has a capacity of C pages, the LIRS algorithm is to rank recently accessed pages according to their RD-R values and retain the C most highly ranked pages in the cache.|$|E
