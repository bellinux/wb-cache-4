500|$|In the episode, Mr. Burns {{places a}} [...] "de-motivational plaque" [...] in Homer's station that reads [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer then places photos of Maggie around the plaque to alter it into saying [...] "Do it for her". The Simpsons writer George Meyer, who enjoys writing jokes that involve anagrams {{or any other}} forms of word play, {{came up with the}} idea for this {{particular}} joke. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> also an homage to Al Jaffee's Fold-in features in the Mad magazine.|$|E

5000|$|In retrospect, {{the writers}} <b>were</b> unsure what <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> in Father Purcell's line [...] "Ah, it's yourself!" [...] <b>was.</b> Linehan thought <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> that Purcell {{believed}} the throw blanket was really Jesus, while Mathews thought <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>was</b> that Purcell would simply talk to anything. The credits scene, where Father Purcell talks {{to himself in}} the closet, was almost entirely improvised by Keaton.|$|R

500|$|... "Sister City" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by series co-creator Michael Schur. The episode featured comedian Fred Armisen in a guest appearance as Raul, the vice director of a Venezuelan parks department. Armisen was a cast member of NBC's sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he previously worked with performer Poehler and writer Schur. Armisen has played Venezuelan characters before, and previously imitated President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Saturday Night Live. Armisen said he got into character by thinking about his uncle, who is from Venezuela. But {{he said it was}} not a difficult performance because [...] "most of <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> the uniform", which included a tan military-style jacket with medals, a red beret and a sash with the colors of the Venezuela flag. The uniform also included a fictional seal designed by Schur, which included an image of Chavez, machine guns, an oil tower, a lion and a parrot.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky. You pick your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is.</b> How much do I care about the joke?" [...] And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode [...] "The Squirt and the Whale", with Bart Simpson writing [...] "South Park—We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared".|$|E
500|$|Fenton {{arrives at}} the oak tree and sings of his {{happiness}} ("Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola" [...] / [...] "From my lips, a song of ecstasy flies") ending with [...] "Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure." [...] Nannetta enters to finish the line with [...] "Indeed, they renew it, like the moon." [...] The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk, telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford's and Caius's plans. Nannetta, as the Fairy Queen, instructs her helpers ("Sul fil d'un soffio etesio" [...] / [...] "On the breath of a fragrant breeze, fly, nimble spirits") before all the characters arrive on the scene. Falstaff's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching, and the men, disguised as elves and fairies, soundly thrash Falstaff. At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> over, and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due. Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue. Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter. A second couple, also in masquerade, ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well. Ford conducts the double ceremony. Caius finds that instead of Nannetta, his bride is the disguised Bardolfo, and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta. Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace. Falstaff, pleased to find himself not the only dupe, proclaims in a fugue, which the entire company sings, that all the world is folly, and all are figures of fun (Tutto nel mondo è burla... Tutti gabbati! / [...] "Everything {{in the world is}} a jest...").|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the joke}} becomes a {{national}} sensation. Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O'Brien's show claiming {{credit for the}} joke. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> played on rapper Kanye West, who does not understand it. West grows angry when others say he does not get it, and will not allow anyone {{to explain it to}} him, because he claims to be a genius and [...] "the voice of a generation". Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia, who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his [...] "dick don't work" [...] in a parody of Viggo Mortensen's character Lalin in Carlito's Way, but Kanye doesn't believe him and beats him to death {{with the help of his}} hired thugs. Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke, prompting Kanye to go after them. Jimmy confronts Cartman, asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write. They are interrupted by Kanye, who threatens to kill them. By now, Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy's help, but believes he also saved his life from a black widow, slew a dragon, defeated an army of Jew robots, and has powers similar to the Human Torch. Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him, but he gets it completely backwards: Cartman believes that Jimmy's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke, while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing, and Jimmy believes him. Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke. However, he incorrectly thinks it means he is, in fact, a gay fish. The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video, in which he happily swims around the sea, kissing and humping random fish.|$|E
2500|$|The DVD extras {{also include}} a music video for the song [...] "Little Mouse" [...] (as {{featured}} in the module on music), a selection of mock-Ceefax pages, and a creator's commentary. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> taken even further by presenting the DVD subtitles {{in exactly the same}} format as those broadcast via teletext.|$|E
2500|$|The {{actual length}} of the laugh the joke got was five seconds when {{originally}} delivered and seven seconds when the gag was reprised on a follow-up show. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> probably not so memorable for the {{length of the}} laugh it provoked, but because it became the definitive [...] "Jack Benny joke"—the joke that best illustrated Benny's [...] "stingy man" [...] persona. The punchline—"I'm thinking it over!"—would not have worked with any other comedian than Benny.|$|E

2500|$|As an April Fools joke, Coursera {{offered an}} online course on {{underwater}} basket weaving as of April 1, 2013.

[...] However, <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> seen by some as being disrespectful of indigenous cultures, and the joke designer issued an apology which was posted on the Coursera class page for [...] "Aboriginal Worldviews and Education."

2500|$|As the [...] "(((Keebler Elves)))" [...] tweet spread, far-right {{accounts}} praised dril, {{interpreting the}} tweet {{as a signal}} of genuine antisemitic views, and others criticized the tweet as bigoted, whether intentionally so or not, {{or at least in}} poor taste. Writer Alexander Mcdonough said dril's [...] "refusal to clarify his views speaks to his trust in his audience to 'get' his jokes" [...] and to dril's confidence in his privacy. [...] "Likewise," [...] Mcdonough wrote, [...] " [...] audience trusts him to make pointed satire that crosses boundaries but is never hateful. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> always on himself or an entrenched elite, dril never [...]" [...] According to Mcdonough, the controversy did not seem to have any long-term impact on dril's popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Everybody is {{laughing}} at A. Mitchell Palmer’s May Day [...] "revolution." [...] <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> certainly on A. Mitchell Palmer, but {{the matter is}} not wholly a joke. The spectacle of a Cabinet officer going around surrounded with armed guards because he is afraid of his own hand-made bogey is a sorry one, even though it appeals to the humor of Americans. Of course, the terrible [...] "revolution" [...] did not come off. Nobody {{with a grain of}} sense supposed that it would. Yet, in spite of universal laughter, the people are seriously disgusted with these official Red scares. They cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars spent in assembling soldiers and policemen and in paying wages and expenses to Mr. Palmer's agents. They help to frighten capital and demoralize business, and to make timid men and women jumpy and nervous.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Miranda {{proclaimed that}} she was not just a [...] "triple threat" [...] entertainer, but a [...] "four threat", because she is also a model, as well as a singer/actor/dancer. Since 2010, she has {{asserted}} that she is a [...] "five threat" [...] talent, adding [...] "magic" [...] to her list of skills, and in videos she has combined inept magic tricks with singing. A regular part of her live comedy acts since 2010 includes a [...] "magic trick" [...] where Miranda sings while appearing to be stabbed through the neck by a sword. <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> that she sings better when the sword is inserted through her neck. In 2012, Miranda Sings was one of the headliners at the Out of the Loop Fringe Festival, presented by WaterTower Theatre in Addison, Texas. A 2012 Miranda Birdland cabaret act was filmed by Seth Rudetsky.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{sequel to}} Gamesmanship, was {{published}} in 1958 under the title of Supermanship.

In truth <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> played out, but he won't face the fact. This manuscript consists of a bunch of marginal articles, written during the past six years and slung together with the minimum of care." [...] Some critics agreed. The New Yorker commented, [...] "his methods and the point of view behind them don't seem as funny or as sharp as they once did, possibly because they are no longer surprising, or possibly because he is getting a little tired of his own joke." [...] But Edmund Wilson remained a fan of Potter, praising [...] "the brevity and compactness of the presentation. As in any practical manual, the principles are stated and concisely illustrated. Nothing goes on too long." ...|$|E

All of <b>the</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>were</b> collected in Australia although some originated from America. <b>The</b> <b>jokes</b> have an element that is, or was, socially unacceptable {{and most have}} no identified author.

2500|$|... (L) The genitive plural of a noun (used with a numeral to {{indicate}} {{five or more}} of something, {{as opposed to the}} dual, used for two, three, or four, see [...] Russian nouns) is a rather unpredictable form of the Russian noun, and there are a handful of words which even native speakers have trouble producing this form of (either due to rarity or an actual lexical gap). A common example of this is kocherga (fireplace poker). <b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> set in a Soviet factory. Five pokers are to be requisitioned. The correct forms are acquired, but as they are being filled out, a debate arises: what is the genitive plural of kocherga? Is it Kocherg? Kocherieg? Kochergov?... One thing is clear: a form with the wrong genitive plural of kocherga will bring disaster from the typically pedantic bureaucrats. Finally, an old janitor overhears the commotion, and tells them to send in two separate requisitions: one for two kochergi and another for three kochergi. In some versions, they send in a request for 4 kochergi and one extra to find out the correct word, only to receive back [...] "here are your 4 kochergi and one extra." ...|$|E

[...] Jonah Engel Bromwich, writing for The New York Times, said dril's style influenced the proliferation of a dialogue-heavy style of writing, akin to screenwriting, that has become common to comedy on Twitter. Dan Hitchens at Christian journal First Things noted, in {{an article about the}} use of irony on social media, that [...] "uch of the art of Twitter consists in appearing to put forward a position while giving the impression that you might be kidding," [...] citing American author David Foster Wallace's warnings about the pervasiveness of irony in modern culture. According to Hitchens, dril is the [...] "cult account that towers above the rest" [...] in his mastery of irony, and dril's [...] "inspired errors in spelling, logic, and decorum can only be produced by a clever creator, but the creator never lets the mask slip. Half <b>the</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> our joint awareness of @dril's lack of self-awareness." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>joke</b> <b>is</b> {{on several}} poets {{cultivated}} by Junimea, who were entirely different {{in style and}} approach. Draft versions of the poem specify the main targets: Junimist poet-soldier Theodor Șerbănescu, and, beyond him, the [...] "Young Germany" [...] idol Heinrich Heine. In Cugetările, Eminescu introduces the derisive neologisms a heiniza, [...] "to Heinefy", and motănime, [...] "cat swarm", which alternate and contrast with words from the deeper layers of the Romanian lexis. Like some German theorists of the day, Eminescu was convinced that [...] "gen'rous youngsters" [...] everywhere had made it their mission to destroy civilization, referring to them as [...] "idiots" [...] with [...] "rotten bodies"; as noted by scholar Ioana Pârvulescu, Dionis is ostensibly a poet by vocation, capable of putting together accomplished verse on a dare. The Cugetările addendum, Simion believes, explains that Poor Dionis should not {{be read as a}} passive and contemplative scenario: [...] "The image of the world as the insipid dream of a tomcat seems a daring minimization of philosophical concepts, curiously so in a spirit such as Eminescu's, that is so very attracted to speculative matters. However, once we hold everything up to the poet's polemical intent, his parody of meditation and mockery of cosmogonic representations reveal their true significance." ...|$|E
