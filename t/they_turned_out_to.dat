25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, {{but that was}} not always the case.

When the new uniforms arrived, <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be winter uniforms. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect upon delivery.

25|$|Braxton {{began his}} long career {{representing}} King William County in the Virginia House of Burgesses, taking {{his seat in}} 1761. However, his brother George died on October 3 of that year, leaving an insolvent estate, so the family lost Newington (which burned down, under other owners, in 1800).

25|$|In 1861 Bummer rescued another dog from a {{fight with}} a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not {{expected}} to live. Bummer coaxed him to eat, brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following Bummer {{as he made his}} begging rounds in the streets.

25|$|At {{the time}} the bridge was built, {{engineers}} had not discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s, well {{after the collapse of}} the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, in 1940. It is therefore fortunate that the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many of the bridges built around the same time have vanished or been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor J. Lloyd Haigh—by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed to stand, with the addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. <b>They</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Nicholas Hardinge (11 April 1781 – 8 March 1808) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Possessing an ability to endear himself to senior {{officers}} through his intellect and good manners, he served under several important naval commanders, whose patronage allowed him to rise through the ranks. His own skill and bravery were also important factors in his promotion to his own command, a fact he demonstrated in 1804 when he led a daring cutting-out operation against two Dutch ships. Promotion to post captain left him temporarily without a command, and he was to be disappointed in a number of the ships he was offered when <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be either unfit for service, or still under construction. Having ended up in the East Indies he was forced to make do with an elderly frigate he had first served on as a midshipman much earlier in his career. While commanding this ship he fought an action with a superior French opponent, and after a gruelling three-day battle the British were victorious and the French captain surrendered. Hardinge did not live to see the moment, having been killed by grapeshot shortly before. He was buried with full military honours and monuments to his memory were erected in St. Thomas Cathedral, Bombay and St Paul's Cathedral, London.|$|E

2500|$|Part of this {{education}} involved {{learning a}} collection of sayings, called huehuetlatolli ("The sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs' ideals. It included speeches and sayings for every occasion, the words to salute the birth of children, and to say farewell at death. Fathers admonished their daughters [...] to be respectful and very clean, but not to use makeup, because they would look like ahuianis. Mothers admonished their daughters to support their husbands, even if <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be humble peasants. Boys were admonished to be humble, obedient and hard workers. Judging by their language, most of the huehuetlatolli seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{professional}} archaeological excavation on Burrough Hill was in 1935; {{it was not}} well recorded, and {{the exact location of}} the trench is not certain, but it covered some [...] and was somewhere outside the east of the hillfort. Finds included animal bones and twelve pieces of Iron Age and Roman pottery. Excavations were next undertaken in 1960, by which time new technology meant non-invasive techniques such as magnetometery could be used alongside digging. About half the fort was surveyed using a proton magnetometer. Several features identified through this geophysical survey were partially excavated; <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be storage pits and produced artefacts such as animal bones, quern stones for grinding, and various shards of Iron Age and Roman pottery.

More animal bone was found here as well as Iron Age and Roman pottery, and a brooch from the La Tène culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, the Dioxin Affair {{occurred}} when 50kg of PCB transformer oils {{were added to}} a stock of recycled fat used {{for the production of}} 500 tonnes of animal feed, eventually affecting around 2,500 farms in several countries. The name Dioxin Affair was coined from early misdiagnosis of dioxins as the primary contaminants, when in fact <b>they</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a relatively small part of the contamination caused by thermal reactions of PCBs. The PCB congener pattern suggested the contamination was from a mixture of Aroclor 1260 & 1254. Over 9 million chickens, and 60,000 pigs were destroyed because of the contamination. [...] The extent of human health effects has been debated, {{in part because of the}} use of differing risk assessment methods. [...] One group predicted increased cancer rates, and increased rates of neurological problems in those exposed as neonates. A second study suggested carcinogenic effects were unlikely and that the primary risk would be associated with developmental effects due to exposure in pregnancy and neonates. Two businessmen who knowingly sold the contaminated feed ingredient received two-year suspended sentences for their role in the crisis.|$|E

30|$|In this work, we have {{extended}} the seminal and very influential work [8] on cortical hallucinations {{after the original}} work of Ermentrout and Cowan [7].
