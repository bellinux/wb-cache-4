That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the game's {{traditional}} friendly feel, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier highlighted in pre-match press conference the importance of winning the Shield: [...] "It is very important <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> match {{is more than a}} friendly. It represents the start of the season. The Community Shield is like a final. There is a trophy at stake and we are the holders." [...] Arsène Wenger wanted to use the match as [...] "the final preparation game for the championship" [...] and commented that Liverpool, amongst four other teams (Manchester United, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Leeds United) would challenge Arsenal in the league.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Washington {{teenager}} MacKaye discovered {{punk rock}} through a local college radio station, Georgetown University's WGTB. He met Nelson, a classmate of his, after the latter {{set off a}} pipe bomb outside their school and MacKaye went to investigate. The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind because I saw {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event. [...] I thought, 'This appeals <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> is the world I think I can breathe in. This is what I need'".|$|E

His mother works for a {{software}} development company, while {{his father was a}} Midwest Airlines pilot. He has one younger sister named Makena. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Lautner has Austrian, Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, and Swiss ancestry, and has stated that he has [...] "distant" [...] Native American ancestry (specifically Ottawa and Potawatomi) through his mother. He grew up in Hudsonville, Michigan, a town near Grand Rapids. He has stated that he was bullied in school because he was an actor. He commented, [...] "I just had to tell myself I can't let this get <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> is what I love to do. And I'm going to continue doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E
500|$|Two concerts Tchaikovsky {{heard in}} Saint Petersburg in January 1889, where his music shared the {{programs}} with compositions by the New Russian School (as the Belyayev circle was also called), proved a major watershed. Tchaikovsky recognized {{that while he}} had maintained good personal relations with {{some members of the}} Balakirev circle, and perhaps some respect, he had never been recognized as one of them. Now with his joint participation in these concerts, he realized he was no longer excluded. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that while he found Cui to be [...] "an individual deeply hateful <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>this</b> in no way hinders me from respecting or loving such representatives of the school as Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov, Glazunov, or from considering myself flattered to appear on the concert platform beside them". This confession showed a wholehearted willingness for Tchaikovsky to have his music heard alongside that of the nationalists.|$|E

500|$|In September 1976, Alston {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. At a press conference, Alston said, [...] "I've been in baseball for 41 years and it's been awfully good <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> has been a pretty big day. I had three birdies playing golf for the first time in my life and now I'm announcing that I'm stepping down as manager. I told Peter this afternoon to give somebody else a chance to manage the club." [...] Alston retired with 2,063 wins (2,040 in the regular season and 23 in the postseason). Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E
500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't {{give a lot of}} credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|... "Boys' Club" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. McCullers co-wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed Poehler in the comedy film Baby Mama. The cold open scene, with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie, {{was added to the}} episode after the rest had already been filmed, and was directed personally by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There {{were a lot of people}} who felt this was not in good taste, but <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> was one of the most fun things about the show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E

We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>This</b> is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises.

500|$|Further {{disappointment}} followed as the American 4 x 100m relay team, with Gay as anchor, {{failed to}} qualify for the final. Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat. Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal. Having failed to reach the finals of the 100m sprint or relay, he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing: [...] " [...] then I went to grab it and there was nothing. It's kind of the way it's been happening <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> Olympics." ...|$|E

[...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> morning with similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E
500|$|In September, 2011, {{following}} the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon {{stars in a}} new Batgirl series—one of The New 52 titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to an earlier age and stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, [...] "our creative teams {{have the ability to}} take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters." [...] Wayne also stated that [...] "The Killing Joke still happened and she was Oracle.

In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".
