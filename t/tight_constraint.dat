[...] These areas have been important for centuries as common land for grazing animals. In the 18th century, when Coventry was much smaller than it is now, the western areas of Hearsall Common fell within Coventry's boundaries, while the eastern areas extended far beyond them.Hearsall Common,together with Coventry's other commons, Sowe, Whitley, Barras Heath and Radford, surrounded the city and constricted its growth. The City was {{the third or fourth}} most important city in the country during the medieval period, behind London, York and, arguably, Norwich, but the jealously guarded Freeman's rights to graze animals on the commons prevented the city from expanding into these areas and growing. This <b>tight</b> <b>constraint</b> on growth is thought to be the reason why Birmingham, which was just a village until the 17th century, became the large metropolis that is now with a population three times greater than that of Coventry.|$|E

40|$|We present {{up-to-date}} {{constraints on}} the value of the fine-structure constant at the epoch of decoupling from the recent observations made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite. In the framework of models we considered, a positive (negative) variation of the value of α at decoupling with respect to the present-day value is now bounded to be smaller than 2 % (6 %) at 95 % confidence level. We point out that the existence of an early reionization epoch as suggested by the above measurements will, when more accurate cosmic microwave background polarization data is available, lead to considerably <b>tighter</b> <b>constraints.</b> The so-called 'reionization bump', in particular, will be extremely useful for this purpose. We find that the <b>tightest</b> possible <b>constraint</b> on α is about 0. 1 % using CMB data alone - <b>tighter</b> <b>constraints</b> will require further (non-CMB) priors. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Constructing such an efficient tensor network, and thus the variational space, is a subtle problem and the main obstacle of the method. We demonstrate the necessity of size consistency in tensor network methods for their success in addressing the quantum many-body problem. We further demonstrate that size consistency is independent of the entanglement criterion, thus providing a general and <b>tight</b> <b>constraint</b> to construct the tensor network method.
