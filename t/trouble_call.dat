60|$|AMONGST {{the simple}} ideas which we receive both from {{sensation}} and reflection, PAIN and PLEASURE {{are two very}} considerable ones. For as in the body there is sensation barely in itself, or accompanied with pain or pleasure, so the thought or perception of the mind is simply so, or else accompanied also with pleasure or pain, delight or <b>trouble,</b> <b>call</b> it how you please. These, like other simple ideas, cannot be described, nor their names defined; the way of knowing them is, as of the simple ideas of the senses, only by experience. For, to define them {{by the presence of}} good or evil, is no otherwise to make them known to us than by making us reflect on what we feel in ourselves, upon the several and various operations of good and evil upon our minds, as they are differently applied to or considered by us.|$|E

40|$|Electricity is {{considered}} {{as an essential}} need for our daily life. The power distribution companies manage the power distribution system safely and efficiently. Efficient functioning of distribution company is important to sustain the development of power sector and economy. Hence {{there was a need}} for some latest and modern systems to be utilized for improving the reliability and efficiency of power sectors. GIS(Geographical Information System) came into existence as an powerful and effective tool for management of transmission and distribution system. The GIS aims to sign-out the suitable locations that are to be fed with power supply. GIS is Useful in development of accurate database,monitoring of supply and its control, analysis of commercial and customer service,energy audit, <b>trouble</b> <b>call</b> management, load management, theft detection etc. GIS technology helps the survey respondents to answer their smart grid questions and address smart grid challenges. GIS makes the smart grid smart because GIS works with data on an interactive map where it can be updated, understood, and shared. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{automation}} of the Utility Enterprise is changing; {{objects are}} in to stay. This paper examines how electric utilities will automate {{to meet the}} competitive market. Deregulation has not only reshaped the organizational structure, {{but it is also}} reshaping the implementation of automation. A Distribution Management System must now be viewed as part of a technical enterprise and must exchange data with a number of other systems. These include corporate data warehouses, customer information systems, <b>trouble</b> <b>call</b> systems, and substation automation systems. Utilities are faced with large-scale integration to provide new services and data for customer retention. Object-based technology is being used to build data models, simplify programming, and allow applications and systems to inter-operate. UTILITY SOFTWARE REVOLUTION Imagine that to watch Monday Night football you need a high-performance ABC multi-media action receiver.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSanjoy DasAnil PahwaOutage {{management}} describes system {{utilized by}} electric distribution utilities {{to help restore}} power in event of an outage. The complexity of outage management system employed by different utilities to determine the location of fault could differ. First step of outage management is {{to know where the}} problem is. Utilities typically depend on customers to call and inform them of the problem by entering their addresses. After sufficient calls are received, the utility is able to pinpoint the location of the outage. This part of outage management is called <b>trouble</b> <b>call</b> analysis. In event of fault in a feeder of a radial distribution system, the upstream device or the device that serves to protect that particular zone activates and opens the circuit. This particular device is considered as the operated protective device. The knowledge of the activated protective device can help locate the fault. Repair crews could be sent to that particular location to carry out power restoration efforts. The main objective of this work is to study model of distribution system that could utilize the network topology and customer calls to predict the location of the operated protective device. Such prediction would be based on the knowledge of the least amount of variables i. e. network topology and customer calls. Radial distribution systems are modeled using the immune system algorithm and test cases with trouble calls are simulated in MATLAB to test the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Also, the proposed technique is tested on an actual feeder circuit with real call scenarios to verify against the known fault locations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Witha view {{to improve}} taxi calling {{services}} nowadays, we propose {{to create a}} brand new smart phone application, ‘FAST CAB’, which {{can be viewed as}} an advanced version of those existing taxi calling applications, Current taxi calling apps provide users with some phone numbers for requesting taxi services and users have to dial in order to contact the service center. Instead of dialing the service center, FAST CAB helps users deliver their requests directly to the nearest drivers through Internet. It greatly saves the <b>trouble</b> <b>calling</b> to taxi drivers and waiting reply from them...|$|R
