25|$|Caine ignored {{their advice}} but did adapt the plot and {{characters}} {{to some of}} T.E. Brown's suggestions. He also sought the advice of two other Manxmen, A.W. Moore and Sir James Gell, particularly on the legal background of the novel. Having assembled his materials, Caine wrote the novel at his house in Bexley {{in the space of}} only seven months, a feat made possible by his recycling material from his 1885 novella, She's All <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> in particular the central scene of Ewan's body floating back to shore. Caine visited the Isle of Man for a week in August to check the locations of some scenes in the novel and by September the novel was ready to go to the publisher. In financial need, Caine sold the copyright to Chatto & Windus for £150, signing the contract on 27 September 1887. Unfortunately for Caine, the terms of the contract meant that he did not gain the wealth of royalties when the book became a best-seller upon its release in November. Indeed, in 1921 when Caine wanted to release his Collected Works through a different publisher, he would have to pay £350 to Chatto & Windus for the rights to The Deemster.|$|E
2500|$|Keats {{wrote his}} last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; [...] "Tis the most {{difficult}} thing in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 {{while at}} UWIC he replied to an advert from British Bobsleigh who {{were searching for}} 'future Olympians'. He was {{accepted}} into the team, and was soon competing at international level. It was announced on 22 January 2014 that Simons would be competing in the bobsleigh for Great Britain at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in the four-man bobsleigh; racing in the second team (GBR2) along with John Baines, Craig Pickering and pilot Lamin Deen. Commenting on the news, Simons said that [...] "It means <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be selected to compete for Team GB at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games". It was his debut Olympics.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, let me go!" [...] cried Ralph. [...] "It is the cruellest {{thing in}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>me</b> cooped up here. I never go anywhere, and never do anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Rho. Alas, dear Palamede! I {{have had}} no joy to write, nor indeed to do any thing in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> please <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> {{greatest}} misfortune imaginable is fallen upon me.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} make {{essential}} money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding {{the advice of his}} friends, Caine’s short novel She's All <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> was published in New York, in 1885 by Harper & Brothers. The first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under American copyright laws the book’s copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed. The novel was never released outside America. [...] Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in The Deemster. It is likely that the story is Caine’s 1883 Liverpool Mercury weekly serial entitled Danny Fayle. [...] At the time Caine and the Mercury’s editor John Lovell attempted to publish the serial as a book but were unable to find a publisher.|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{released}} on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, and Eminem's newly founded label, Shady Records in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem {{sitting on the porch}} of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, [...] "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> thank you all so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E
