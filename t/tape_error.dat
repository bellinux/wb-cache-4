As storage requirements grow, {{so does the}} number of routine tasks that the administrator must perform, {{as well as the}} time it takes for these to be executed. The solution being proposed to ease this burden is the Mass Storage System Administrator Autonomic Assistant (MSSAAA). The MSSAAA is a collection of agents that perform some of the more common tasks while the administrators handle higher-level issues. Using the principles of autonomic computing, the MSSAAA is governed by a centralized set of policies that the administrator will review on a regular basis and can adjust as necessary. The goal is to develop an autonomic assistant to substantially reduce the amount of time it takes to address specific problems in the system. Using tools such as IBM’s Generic Log Adapter, Resource Model Builder, and Autonomic Management Engine, the MSSAAA has been able to (i) quickly determine when <b>tape</b> <b>errors</b> occur and correct them, (ii) monitor the network file system mounts for poor performance and report those, and (iii) correct network file system handle problems through continuous monitoring.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaIt {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that tape dropouts {{are the major}} impediment to error-free recording in high density digital recorders (HDDR). Conceptually, the effects of <b>tape</b> dropouts on <b>error</b> performance can be combatted by error correcting codes, signal design {{or a combination of}} the two. In this paper the effect of tape dropouts on wide time-bandwidth signals is considered. Wide time-bandwidth signaling techniques, commonly refered to as pulse compression, would appear to be capable of combatting the effects of short tape dropouts. Although the wide time-bandwidth signals are, to a certain degree, immune to short signal dropouts, an excessive performance penalty is paid when dropouts exceed about 10 % of the signal duration. The effects of tape dropouts are shown to effectively reduce noise margin by decreasing the signal detection filter output and by introducing intersymbol interference through increased sidelobe levels...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA miniature, single-channel, crystal-controlled {{transmitter}} {{has been developed}} for biomedical applications. A narrowband frequency modulation (± 7 kHz) of the RF is used to achieve maximum operating range with minimum transmitting power. The radiated power is limited {{to stay within the}} 50 μv/m at 15 m FCC requirement for low power transmitters (Part 15. 212 FCC Regulations) in the 88 to 108 MHz band. This technique offers a number of advantages. First only manufacturer’s type approval is required for the device and the user does not need a license. Second maximum operating range can be achieved within the FCC power limitations by using a narrowband that is consistent with the required medical information bandwidth. A third advantage in using the 88 to 108 MHz band is that the commercial FM stations are relatively widely spaced and carefully regulated so that by selecting the transmitter’s frequency in the guard band between stations, minimum interference from other transmitter sources is encountered. For EKG and EEG applications, where an information bandwidth of 0. 1 to 150 Hz is adequate, a subcarrier with a fixed frequency (approximately 1 kHz) is used with differential pulse width modulation (DPWM). This type of subcarrier has the advantage of simple circuitry for both the transmitter and demodulator. Since DPWM is self-aligning, it can be handled effectively by magnetic tape recorders having relatively high <b>tape</b> speed <b>errors.</b> For EMG and other high frequency data signals the RF can be directly frequency modulated without the use of a subcarrier...|$|R

By expanding the surface currents on the tape {{in a series of}} Chebyshev polynomials, the unquantifiable assumptions made in all previously published analyses of the tape helix regarding the forms of the surface current on the tape, or the electric fields at the radius of the tape, are avoided. The power flow and interaction impedance are exactly computed. The dispersion relation is solved numerically for slow waves and the resulting phase velocity and interaction impedance are compared to those computed using the frequently made assumptions of constant current along the tape and zero current across the tape. It is found that for wide <b>tapes</b> significant <b>errors</b> are made in both the phase velocity and interaction impedance when neglecting the transverse variation of the longitudinal current and neglecting the transverse current. For narrow tapes, the two approaches agree to good accuracy. Plots of the surface currents for wide and narrow tapes are presented.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} two new tape archival {{policies that}} can improve tape archive performance in certain regimes, {{compared to the}} classical RAIT (Redundant Array of Independent Tapes) policy. The first policy, PARALLEL, still requires as many parallel tape drives as RAIT but pre-computes large data stripes that are written contiguously on tapes to increase write/read performance. The second policy, VERTICAL, writes contiguous data into a single <b>tape,</b> while updating <b>error</b> correcting information on the fly and delaying its archival until enough data has been archived. This second approach reduces the number of tape drives used for every user request to one. The performance of the three RAIT, PARALLEL and VERTICAL policies is assessed through extensive simulations, using a hardware configuration and a distribution of I/O requests similar to these expected on the BLUE WATERS system. These simulations show that VERTICAL is the most suitable policy for small files, whereas PARALLEL must be used for files larger than 1 GB. We also demonstrate that RAIT never outperforms both proposed policies, and that a heterogeneous policies mixing VERTICAL and PARALLEL performs 10 times {{better than any other}} policy. I...|$|R
40|$|Ankle sprains {{are common}} sports injuries. Inadequate foot {{position}} awareness {{is thought to}} be the fundamental cause of these injuries. Ankle taping may decrease risk of injury through improving foot position awareness. The benefit of taping is thought to decrease with duration of exercise because of poor tape adherence to human skin. This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled comparison experiment that tested the hypothesis that ankle taping improves foot position awareness before and after exercise. A sample of 24 healthy young blindfolded volunteers, wearing their own athletic shoes, indicated perceived slope direction and estimated slope amplitude when bearing full body weight and standing on a series of blocks. The top slope of the blocks varied between 0 degree and 25 degrees, in 2. 5 degrees increments, to orient the plantar surface with respect to the leg toward pronation, supination, plantarflexion, and dorsiflexion, relative to its position on a flat surface. Foot position awareness, which was considered the reciprocal of surface slope estimate error, varied with testing condition, particularly when surface slope was greater than 10 degrees, presumably the most important range considering ankle injuries. In this higher range absolute position error was 4. 23 degrees taped, and 5. 53 degrees untaped (P < 0. 001). Following exercise, in the higher range absolute position error was 2. 5 % worse when taped and 35. 5 % worse when untaped (P < 0. 001). These data support the hypothesis that ankle taping improves proprioception before and after exercise. They also indicate that foot position awareness declines with exercise. Compared to barefoot data (position error 1. 97 degrees), foot position error was 107. 5 % poorer with athletic footwear when untaped (absolute position error 4. 11 degrees), and 58. 1 % worse when <b>taped</b> (position <b>error</b> 3. 13 degrees). This suggests that ankle taping partly corrects impaired proprioception caused by modern athletic footwear and exercise. Footwear could be optimized to reduce the incidence of these injuries...|$|R
40|$|High density {{digital tape}} systems provide a {{cost-efficient}} and reliable solution for massive data backup. To maintain a competitive position against other data storage technologies, the tape industry aims to enable higher track densities and shorter data access time. The servomechanisms {{of the tape}} transport system and the head positioning system need to be improved for these purposes. This thesis investigates combined feedforward and feedback control in the tape transport dynamics and the head actuator, respectively. As the tape winds from one reel to the other, the reel radii vary due to the winding of the tape and the reel runouts. These variations can cause tension <b>errors.</b> As the <b>tape</b> is very thin, the variations between two consecutive revolutions can be considered negligible. A feedforward-inspired control scheme is developed {{to take into account}} the time-varying radius to reduce <b>tape</b> tension <b>error</b> caused by the variations in radii. In order to better align the write/read head with the desired data track, a combined feedforward/feedback control scheme to improve the tape head positioning servo system in the presence of lateral tape motion is also developed. Approximate dynamic inversion techniques and model matching methods are investigated to design the feedforward controller. The feedforward control is computed based upon an estimate of the lateral tape motion displacements (LTMDs) at the head that is calculated using measurements of the upstream and downstream lateral tape motion displacements near the head. To find the correlation between successive LTMDs, linear and polynomial regression methods are first studied. The nonlinear partial differential equation modeling tape motion in the lateral direction is then explored to solve the displacements for a short segment of tape surrounding the head using measurements of the upstream and downstream displacements as boundary conditions. The equation is discretized in the spatial domain using the finite element method (FEM) and integrated using the Wilson theta approximation. Performance and effectiveness of the controllers are demonstrated in simulations. Feasibility analysis of implementing the feedforward controller on an actual tape drive is also conducted...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} error in {{measurements}} {{is fundamental to}} the study of elementary surveying. Textbooks used for such courses often include this topic in the first chapters of the book. Students may not always consider the error involved with measurements, particularly using modern advanced surveying techniques, unless the course is conducted in a manner that develops this premise. The theme of error in measurements is developed through the entire semester of the course by not only traditional means common in many surveying courses and but also new assignments and activities. The current textbook used in the course covers the subject matter in the second chapter. An active classroom exercise is used to bring the experience of the subject matter into the classroom when covering this chapter. Laboratory exercises for the course still utilize the steel <b>tape.</b> Thus, <b>error</b> corrections for temperature can be used to reinforce the concept of error. An Internet investigation assignment is used to get students to search beyond the class textbook and reinforce the types of error that occur with EDM and GPS equipment. Level survey work both in the classroom and laboratory always involve “closing the circuit”. Finally, {{near the end of the}} course, latitudes and departures exercises are used to bring distance measurement together with directions and subsequent computation and balancing the latitudes and departures by the compass rule. The reinforcement of error in measurements permits this theme to stay with the subject matter of the course all semester long. The knowledge of error in surveying measurements can be an aspect of meeting a TAC-ABET program objective of quality. Students who take subsequent courses in surveying will certainly study error in measurements in more detail. However, students who only take the elementary surveying class will have the theme emphasized repeatedly during the semester and thus they also will recognize that error occurs in all measurements and be able to interpret data with this knowledge...|$|R

Postopertively, all patients with urodynamic testing still showed evidence of ISD and were treated successfully with repeat TVT without removal of the TOT sling from the prior procedure. Moore et al. [15] reported just five patients and concluded the TOT sling did not provide a large enough angle of support or enough urethral kinking to provide continence in patients with ISD. Therefore, a TVT sling was a viable option for a prior failed TOT [14]. Villet et el. [10] reported three patients with recurrent or persistent SUI after a prior TVT procedure.

The increasing use of low-pressure lay-flat drip laterals, characterized by a thin-walled polyethylene pipe, makes necessary a specific determination of their hydraulic properties, aimed to a correct design of such systems. Here, the validity of an empirical local losses estimation model was assessed for five different commercial lay-flat drip <b>tapes.</b> Moreover, the <b>errors</b> in the maximum lateral lengths obtained for a fixed emitter uniformity, when the local losses are neglected or empirically estimated, were evaluated. The step by step (SBS) procedure was then implemented to model the hydraulic behavior of each tested lateral with values of the upstream pressure head different than those investigated. The experiments demonstrated that under the examined flow conditions, local losses represent a percentage variable between 2. 0 and 11. 4 % of the friction losses measured in the laterals. Due to the limited contraction of flow streamlines produced by the emitters, the resulting values of the kinetic head coefficient, α, were generally small and variable in the range between 0. 020 and 0. 060. The SBS procedure indicated that in lay-flat drip laterals, only when emitter spacing results are lower than 50 cm should it be necessary to take into account local losses, as the errors of ignoring such losses are negligible in the other cases. The results finally evidenced that the empirical local losses estimation model, valid for thick-walled laterals, generally overestimates α, allowing a more conservative evaluation of the lateral lengths when a fixed EU is desired...|$|R

Modified and adapted commercial Hi- 8 video recorders {{have been used for}} sample generation whilst analytical techniques such as SXPS,IMS and SEM have been employed in the surface characterisation. The durability of the media was assessed through stop motion (still frame) and cycling tests, where error growth and signal degradation were measured as a function of running time. The tests were performed under ambient (22 °C, 40 % RH) and high humidity (22 °C, 80 % RH) conditions. Characterisation of the lubricant layer on each tape was performed through models based on XPS and angle resolved XPS. The lubricant thickness can significantly affect the durability and signal output level of a thin film tape and thus it is important that reliable quantification can be achieved. Various models were considered for determining the lubricant thickness although ultimately, the most suitable technique was deemed to be a model that assumed a uniform layer structure. In addition to thin film metal evaporated media, equivalent durability tests and surface analysis experiments were performed using a commercial metal particle tape in order that comparisons could be made between the two types of recording media. The signal performance of the thin film metal evaporated media was found to be quite different from that for the metal particle <b>tape</b> since dropout <b>errors</b> and signal degradation increased at a much earlier stage. Extensive surface analyses enabled the mechanisms responsible for media failure and error growth to be identified in the ME and MP tapes and these were found to result from cyclic stressing and fatigue on the immediate substrate of the media...|$|R
