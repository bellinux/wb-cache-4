5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> in Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary {{of the fact that}} many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher than <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> along {{the external}} wall.

5|$|The Amorites in Qatna spoke {{their own}} {{language}}, but kings communicated with <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> using Akkadian, {{which was the}} language of writing in the city. Qatna's Akkadian became heavily influenced by Hurrian in the 15th and 14th centuries BC; Richter argued that a special AkkadianHurrian hybrid dialect developed in Qatna.

5|$|The {{catalytic}} subunit α {{of protein}} kinase A {{is a key}} regulatory enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PRKACA gene.

5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries.

However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign.|$|E
