5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue a call to <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>to</b> halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E

25|$|Collectively these 3 {{factors were}} {{considered}} to be responsible for causing 70% of the exodus, according to the IDF report.

25|$|In Arish alone, Gazans {{spent some}} US$250 million over five days. Palestinians and Egyptians complained about soaring prices and shortages, {{especially}} of food. Enormous demand for staple products from Gaza caused rampant inflation, {{as did the}} Egyptian government's decision to restrict goods coming into the border region {{in an effort to}} encourage <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>to</b> go back home. Palestinians also accused Egyptians of price gouging, where prices have risen {{to the point where the}} cost of goods is suffiently high that supply matches demand.|$|E
25|$|The move also follows an {{aggressive}} {{and at least}} partially successful campaign by <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>to</b> court recognition in the build-up to the vote, including numerous Latin American countries. Several leaders said they would support Palestine's bid for statehood during the general debates, though US President Barack Obama called for direct dialogue, amidst earlier threats to veto the move in the Security Council.

25|$|According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Israel {{would have}} {{withdrawn}} from 63 settlements. According to Robert Wright, Israel would only keep the settlements with large populations. Wright states that all others would be dismantled, {{with the exception}} of Kiryat Arba (adjacent to the holy city of Hebron), which would be an Israeli enclave inside the Palestinian state, and would be linked to Israel by a bypass road. The West Bank would be split in the middle by an Israeli-controlled road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, with free passage for Palestinians, although Israel reserved the right to close the road to passage in case of emergency. In return, Israel would allow <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> <b>to</b> use a highway in the Negev to connect the West Bank with Gaza. Wright states that in the Israeli proposal, the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be linked by an elevated highway and an elevated railroad running through the Negev, ensuring safe and free passage for Palestinians. This highway would be under the sovereignty of Israel, and Israel reserved the right to close the highway to passage in case of emergency.|$|E
