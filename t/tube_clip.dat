5000|$|Power amp {{clipping}} is not {{the same}} thing as preamp/preamp <b>tube</b> <b>clipping.</b> Sending a power amp signal that is getting power amp clipping to a speaker can blow the speaker. Sending a preamp/preamp <b>tube</b> <b>clipped</b> signal through a speaker is not harmful. In practice, part of the [...] "breaking up" [...] amp sound, of a [...] "cranked" [...] amplifier, which is widely appreciated by hard rock, metal, punk and blues musicians, is a mix of preamp and power amp clipping. One of the benefits of using a separate components head system, in which a separate preamp and power amp are mounted in a rack, is that the bassist or bass tech can watch for the clipping warning LED on the power amp and lower the power amp volume, if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Some audiophiles [...] {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes (especially when used {{with little or no}} negative feedback) is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum <b>tubes</b> <b>clip</b> more gradually than transistors, resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. This gradual onset of clipping is known as gain compression or [...] "soft clipping". Circuits can be designed using either tubes or transistors to achieve this effect, and the behavior can be simulated with digital processing.|$|R
50|$|The DARD 120 uses a split {{breechblock}} system. The {{weapon is}} made up of two parts, a disposable pre-loaded launch <b>tube</b> <b>clips</b> onto a reusable firing device. The firing device weighs 9.92 pounds (4.5 kg) and is 30 inches (0.76m) long. The launch tube weighs an additional 22 pounds (10 kg) and is 47 inches (1.2m) in long. The DARD fires a 7.27 pounds (3.3 kg) HEAT warhead at 918 ft/s (280 m/s). It is capable of penetrating 33.4 inches (850mm) of steel armor. With optional night vision sights and an operating temperature range between -22 and 122 degrees Fahrenheit (-30 and 50 degrees Celsius), the DARD is a versatile weapon {{that can be used in}} desert as well as arctic conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Class-AB {{push-pull}} topology {{is nearly}} universally used in tube amps for electric guitar applications that produce power {{of more than}} about 10 watts. While audiophile amps are primarily concerned with avoiding distortion, a guitar amp embraces it. When driven to their respective limits, tubes and transistors distort quite differently. <b>Tubes</b> <b>clip</b> more softly than transistors, [...] allowing higher levels of distortion (which is sometimes desired by the guitarist) whilst still being able to distinguish the harmonies of a chord. The soft profile of the tube amplifier's distortion means that the intermodulation products of the distortion closely relate to the chord harmonies. All sides of the question are inclined to agree that valve guitar amplifiers offer a useful sound. Yet there are also respected solid-state designs.|$|R

5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum <b>tubes</b> <b>clip</b> more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|R
5000|$|As well, since guitar techs need to soundcheck the {{instruments}} and amplifiers, {{they must have}} {{a knowledge of the}} way guitars and amplifiers are supposed to sound in the style of music of the band. This means that the guitar tech must have an ear for music, and for musical tones and sounds. A guitar tech for a heavy metal band must be able to tell whether distortion from a heavily over-driven tube amp is desirable <b>tube</b> <b>clipping</b> or distortion from a blown speaker or damaged power amp. The distinctions a guitar tech must make can be subtle. For example, a guitar tech replacing a blown tube with a new one may have to ensure that the tube amplifier still has the same [...] "color" [...] or [...] "warmth" [...] when chords are played through it.|$|R

Apart from a few remarks on phonetics, lexis and morphosyntax, its specific focus are pragmalinguistic issues. After a brief state-of-the-art, analyses of both natural and experimentally elicited language data from oral and written contexts are presented. The analyses rest on both qualitative approaches (VOICE and You <b>Tube</b> <b>clips)</b> and quantitative approaches (one type of DPTs, two types of MJTs and one type of semantic differential). The studies show that quantitative analyses with experimental methods often falsify hypotheses that have suggested themselves from prior qualitative research ("let-it pass principle " among natives and non-natives) and from normative language guides ("learner-book illusion", "complex-is-polite principle", "middle slots relevance"). The article then shows how the linguistic findings from such experimental designs {{can and should be}} rendered into principles and components for Teaching English as a Global Language, which would require constant work-in-progress models.

50|$|In Japan, the Super GT series divides cars {{into two}} classes, called GT500 and GT300.

Proponents of the series claim that the Super GT cars are the fastest sports cars in the world, while critics deride the cars as being outside the limits of 'acceptable' modifications. In recent years however, rule changes in both GT500 and GT1 (aimed at eventually allowing both classes to compete with each other in the future) have brought the cars closer to each other, although GT500 cars still have a notable advantage in terms of aerodynamics and cornering performance (enough to compensate for GT1 cars greater power).|$|R

40|$|An {{engaging}} discussion {{followed the}} presentation of the paper; questions were posed by those in attendance. I received positive feedback informally, from individuals attending the conference after {{the presentation of}} the paper. Working with families is fraught with complexity, including dealing with issues such as intimate partner violence. Faculty teaching within a family-newborn course with undergraduate nursing students sought innovative strategies to engage and support students to broach this difficult topic with families in acute care and community settings. Faculty noted that students in clinical experiences reported that nurses were not accurately assessing and consistently screening for intimate partner violence. However, assessing and screening for violence is part of the role of all nurses and falls within the standards of practice for community health nurses. The purpose of this presentation is to share several innovative teaching strategies undertaken by faculty working with undergraduate nursing students to explore and examine intimate partner violence. Faculty employed teaching strategies integrating popular culture as a medium to explore intimate partner violence through relevant music videos and you <b>tube</b> <b>clips.</b> These strategies were followed by large group discussion surrounding the messages around gender and violence imbedded in the words and images shown. With the students engaged by the popular culture references, theory and evidence-based practice regarding assessment, screening, and intervention around intimate partner violence was offered. The foundation of these innovative teaching strategies is to invite undergraduate nursing students to: (1) examine their personal values, beliefs and assumptions around gender and violence; (2) consider the contexts for assessment and screening of families for intimate partner violence across community health nursing practice settings. The key learning outcomes for this presentation are: 1) 	influencing undergraduate nursing students to situate their nursing practice {{in the context of their}} values, beliefs and assumptions 2) 	influencing nursing educators to consider innovative teaching strategies using popular culture to engage and inform undergraduate nursing students 3) 	inspiring the current and future generation of nurses to accurately assess and consistently screen for intimate partner violence across community health settings. The target audience for this presentation includes: nursing educators, nursing students, and all public health and home health nurses curious about accurately assessing and screening for intimate partner violence across community health settings.

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods for {{grafting}} vegetable crops. Cleft grafting occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted. The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs. [...] Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse. Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion. [...] Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone <b>tube</b> or <b>clip.</b> [...] This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output. Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent 14.|$|R

Influence of 2 levels of clipping [unclipped {{during the growing season}} and clipped (C) to 10 -cm stubble height each time regrowth reached 40 cm]; fertilizer [unfertilized and 70 - 34 - 44 kg N-P-K/ha (F) ]; and watering frequency [irrigated to field capacity at 7 - (WET) and 14 - (DRY) day intervals] on cumulative herbage dry matter yield, crude protein yield, and water-use efficiency, and root mass of individual weeping lovegrass plants grown in soil contained in polyethylene <b>tubes</b> was determined. <b>Clipping</b> combined with fertilization improved herbage dry matter yield and water-use efficiency. Fertilized plants yielded at least 5. 4 g crude protein/tube as compared to less than 2. 0 g crude protein/tube produced by unfertilized plants. Between 1 June and 15 September 1983 WET-F-treated plants provided sufficient regrowth for 5 harvest events with an average of 24 -day intervals between harvests. In contrast, regrowth of WET-, DRY-F, and DRY-treated plants was harvested 3 times with intervals between harvests averaging between 32 and 35 days.

40|$|The {{decorator}} worm, a sedentary predator, {{builds a}} micro-reef on {{the portion of}} its tube above the sediment, which attracts prey. When <b>tube</b> tops are <b>clipped</b> in the lab, the worm rebuilds compulsively. Glass beads and antifouling materials were used as decoration substrates to characterize bioadhesive biochemistry and adhesion to antifouling substrate. Decorator worm adhesive was largely proteinaceous with phosphate presence {{and a lack of}} glycoprotein. The Introduction explains the scientific context for studying natural underwater adhesives, including efforts to understand conserved molecular mechanisms in underwater adhesion to further fouling prevention on boat hulls or medical implants and biomimicking natural glues for industrial or biomedical applications. The Methods provides detailed steps to test decorator worm adhesive for protein, phosphoprotein, and glycoprotein presence. This section also provides details on how to make worms decorate with antifouling substrates. The Results section shows that decorator worm bioadhesive is highly proteinaceous and has higher phosphate presence in the tube as compared to glue on glass beads. The adhesive did not contain significant glycoprotein. The decorator worm adheres mixed ion exchange resin, synthetic ion exchange resin, strongly basic anion exchange resin, aminopropyl silane modified glass particles (. 5 - 10 μm), imitation seagrass, plastic zip ties, iPhone cases, silicone, silicone infused with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and silicone infused with decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) to its tube. This report details findings on the decorator worm as a novel system for studying adhesive and antifouling materials: •	Adhesive shows high protein content •	Tube adhesive shows higher phosphoprotein than adhesive on glass beads •	Adhesive shows little to no glycoprotein presence •	Decorator worms adheres all materials tested to their tubes •	Decorator worms relatively large size and readiness to adhere any material to the exterior tubes make them excellent candidates to testing antifoul release material...|$|R
40|$|LHCb {{is one of}} {{the four}} large {{experiments}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) based at CERN. The LHCb experiment is taking data at its nominal design luminosity. However, in order to distinguish among models of new physics, higher luminosity is needed. So the LHCb collaboration intends to upgrade the detector during the planned long LHC shutdown in 2019 {{in order to be able}} to operate at a luminosity about 10 times the nominal one. The objective the present thesis is the development of an integrated solution for the analog signal processing in the electronic and hadronic calorimeters of the LHCb. The analogue signal processing will be performed by a shaper ASIC in the calorimeters Front End (FE) boards. The signal pulse from a photomultiplier <b>tube</b> is <b>clipped</b> at its base and, then, is transmitted through a 12 m 50 Ω coaxial cable to the FE board located in the crates at the calorimeter platform. In order to reduce the PMT ageing after the increase in luminosity, the gain has to be decreased by a factor 5 with respect to the present operation in order to keep the same average current. Therefore, the preamplifier input noise must be decreased accordingly so that the total input referred noise voltage is smaller than 1 nV/√Hz. Consequently, a 50 Ω termination resistor is not acceptable. The main requirements for the analogue FE of the calorimeter system include a cali- bration of 4 fC/ 2. 5 MeV per ADC count; a dynamic range of 12 bits; noise lower than 1 ADC cnt (ENC < 4 fC); and a spill-over residue level ± 1 % a linearity: < 1 %. The implementation of the ASIC includes: four analog channels with programmable values to control the key parameters and compensate for process variations; a dedicated Delay Locked Loop (DLL) to synchronize each channel signal phase and a digital interface using SPI protocol. The analog channel is designed with an input amplifier that includes an electronically cooled termination input stage. A passive line termination would induce too large a noise and is avoided. Afterwards an alternated switched differential signal paths scheme permits the integration of the signal with no dead time between consecutive events. Each path includes a pole-zero filter in order to compensate for cable effects, a switched integrator with capacitive feedback, a Track-and-Hold for a 12 -bit ADC and a MUX to select the correct sub-channel output signal. A fully differential signal processing is adopted in order to minimize the impact of common mode noise, which is important in a switched system. Each analog channel includes a delay line based on a DLL so the user can set a delay to compensate the delay introduced by PMT voltage settings, cable lengths or particle time of flight from the interaction point to the calorimeter cells. The DLL is adjusted by means of two control voltages to ensure that systematic process or environmental variations will not affect the channel time tuning. The radiation hardness expected from the selected technology (0. 35 µm AMS SiGe BiCMOS) is enough, but design techniques are used to ensure being able to tolerate SEUs, SETs and SELs. The design has been checked at different tests of a total of 30 pieces of the final pro- totype: at the laboratory using a signal obtained with a scope, with electron beams and ECAL channels in a dedicated facility at CERN, and its radiation hardness at Centre de Resources du Cyclotron at Louvain la Neuve. Dedicated boards were developed and the results are positive. L’LHCb és un dels quatre grans experiments del Gran Col·lisionador d’Hadrons al CERN. En aquest moment, l’experiment LHCb ja ha profunditzat en el seu programa de presa de dades, però, per tal de realitzar estudis destinats a distingir entre models de nova física es pretén actualitzar el detector el 2019 per tal d’operar amb una lluminositat uns deu cops superior a l’actual. L’objectiu de la present Tesi és el desenvolupament d’una solució integrada pel processat del senyal analògic en la actualització i millora de l’electrònica del Calorímetre, sub-detector de l’LHCb. Aquest processat es durà a terme a les plaques d’electrònica front-end (FE) mitjançant un ASIC que rep polsos que venen de tubs fotomultiplicadors (PM) a través de 12 m de cable coaxial de 50 Ohms. Els principals requeriments del FE analògic del Calorímetre inclouen una calibració de 4. 5 fc/ 2. 5 MeV per compte d’ADC, un rang dinàmic de 12 bits, un soroll menor a 1 compte d’ADC, un nivell de cua residual menor que 1 % i una desviació de la linearitat menor que 1 %. La implementació de l’ASIC inclou quatre canals analògics amb valors programables, una línia de retard (DLL) i una interfase digital utilitzant protocol SPI. El canal analògic disposa d’un amplificador d’entrada que inclou una terminació de línia activa. Desprès, un sistema de dos subcanals diferencials commutats permet la integració del senyal sense temps morts entre esdeveniments consecutius. Cada subcanal inclou un filtre de pol-zero, un integrador commutat, un Track-and-Hold i un multiplexor. Finalment, la DLL proporciona els senyals de rellotge per sincronitzar els canals. La pròpia resistència a la radiació que assegura el fet de fer servir la tecnologia escollida (AMS 0. 35 um BICMOS) i l’ús de tècniques específiques permet una tolerància del circuit integrat a SEUs, SETs i SELs, als nivells esperats al detector. El disseny ha estat verificat en diferents proves per un total de 30 prototips de la versió final del xip: primer, al laboratori, utilitzant un senyal obtingut amb un oscil·loscopi al detector; amb feixos d’electrons i canals del detector, a zones dedicades al CERN; i, la resistència a la radiació s’ha verificat al CRC a Louvain la Neuve, Bèlgica...|$|R
