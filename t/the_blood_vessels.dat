5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E

40|$|A {{non-invasive}} method and apparatus is disclosed for measuring pressure within a pliable vessel {{such as a}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> is clamped {{by means of a}} clamping structure having a first portion housing a pressure sensor and a second portion extending over the remote side of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> for pressing <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> into engagement with the pressure sensing device.

3000|$|... of <b>the</b> angiography, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> {{analysis}} is substantially important mainly {{in a sense}} of an objectification and modeling of the pathological spots such as <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> calcifications. An amount of the calcification is commonly just estimated by naked eyes; therefore, the automatic modeling may be beneficial in a context of an extraction of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> features well representing a level of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> deterioration. In this work, we have proposed a fully automatic software environment (BloodVessCalc) for processing <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> images acquired by the CT (computer tomography). The main function of the SW is the multiregional image segmentation allowing for an extraction of <b>the</b> physiological <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> location from <b>the</b> calcification spots.

In the last part of our analysis, the predictive intervals of the average value and median for calcium score are calculated.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} ways to stop blood flow in portal veins and in hepatic veins either {{pharmacologically}} or physically. The proposed mathematical model can be used to predict temperature elevation during the treatment in this case. If blood flow was stopped, it will be easier to ablate tumor close to <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> wall. However, due to a high temperature, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> wall can be damaged or <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> can be occluded [7]. Prior to the treatment, the model can predict whether <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> will be damaged or not.

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to embolize vascular lesions through interventional radiology; this requires passing a catheter through a large artery and locating the maxillary artery under X-ray guidance, followed by the injection into the vessel of particles that occlude <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The benefit from the procedure tends to be short-lived, and it may be most appropriate in episodes of severe bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{approach}} for modeling torsion of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that undergo deformation and joining. The proposed model takes 3 D mesh of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> as input. It first fits a generalized cylinder to extract <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel’s</b> medial axis. Then, it uses rotation minimizing frame {{as a reference}} to model and measure <b>the</b> torsion of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> after deformation. In general, the proposed approach can incorporate any kind of deformation algorithms. In our experiments, differential geometry method is used as an example.

5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions.

The inner lining of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Radio-frequency (RF) hepatic ablation, {{offers an}} {{alternative}} method {{for the treatment}} of hepatic malignancies. We employed finite-element method (FEM) analysis to determine tissue temperature distribution during RF hepatic ablation. We constructed three-dimensional (3 -D) thermal-electrical FEM models consisting of a four-tine RF probe, hepatic tissue, and a large <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> (10 -mm diameter) located at different locations. We simulated our FEM analyses under temperature-controlled (90 C) 8 -min ablation. We also present a preliminary result from a simplified two-dimensional (2 -D) FEM model that includes a bifurcated <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> Lesion shapes created by the four-tine RF probe were mushroom-like, and were limited by <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> When <b>the</b> distance of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> was 5 mm from the nearest distal electrode 1) in the 3 -D model, the maximum tissue temperature (hot spot) appeared next to electrods A. The location of the hot spot was adjacent to another electrode 2) on the opposite side when <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> was 1 mm from electrode A. The temperature distribution in the 2 -D model was highly nonuniform due to the presence of <b>the</b> bifurcated <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> Underdosed areas might be present next to <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> from which <b>the</b> tumor can regenerate.

5|$|The {{military}} and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in {{noise in the}} oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This {{may lead to a}} bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> become blocked, so-called decompression sickness.

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
