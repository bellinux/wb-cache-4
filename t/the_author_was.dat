5|$|Brodie's {{research}} was enlarged and critiqued by other students of Mormonism, most notably Dale L. Morgan (1914–1971), {{who became a}} lifelong friend, mentor, and sounding board.

5|$|Cutting the Mustard {{describes}} an unsuccessful {{case in which}} <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> involved as an attorney. Boston University School of Theology dean of student affairs Nancy Richardson was removed from her position by the school's administration in 1981.

5|$|For {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of The Van, Doyle and Myles formed their own production company, Deadly Films, and <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> given creative {{control over the}} selection of its cast and director. Frears returned as director, and Meaney was cast in the lead role. Although The Van (1996) premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival to some favorable reviews, critical reaction was negative upon release; reviewers criticized the film for its thin material and lack of strong characterization.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>is</b> {{focusing}} {{on issues of}} opera in new media in her work. The introduction defines and decribes the concept of new medias.

As a next topic mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> work <b>is</b> possibility to watch live broadcasts or records via particular websites of theatres.

5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> a pagan {{who supported the}} Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose The Last Picture Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway. Thompson came on board to write the script of his crime novel's film adaptation. Creative differences ensued between Thompson and McQueen and <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> fired along with Bogdanovichthey were replaced with Hill and Peckinpah. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair, and McQueen and Peckinpah were involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his work.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century. Another influence {{may have been a}} negative experience within the author's family; after he had chosen a Sundanese woman to be his wife, Rusli's family brought him back to Padang and forced him to marry a Minangkabau woman chosen for him.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of poems in the {{collection}} that are written from a woman's point of view, but it <b>is</b> unclear if <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>is</b> Shelton, or if, for that matter, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>is</b> a woman at all.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>was</b> granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; there was only a three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E
