25|$|The first {{income tax}} {{suggested}} in the United States was during the War of 1812. The idea for the tax {{was based on the}} British Tax Act of 1798. The British tax law applied progressive rates to income. The British tax rates ranged from 0.833% on income starting at £60 to 10% on income above £200. The <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> was developed in 1814. Because the treaty of Ghent was signed in 1815, ending hostilities and the need for additional revenue, the tax was never imposed in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Liberals {{returned}} in a hung parliament after the election: The Liberals formed a minority government {{with the support}} of the Labour and Irish nationalist MPs. The Lords subsequently accepted the Budget when the land <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> was dropped. However, as a result of the dispute over the Budget, the new government introduced resolutions (that would later form the Parliament Bill) to limit the power of the Lords. The Prime Minister, H. H.

The King assented, provided that Asquith went back to the polls to obtain an explicit mandate for the constitutional change.|$|E
25|$|Besides, Landale {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{businessmen}} in the colony who repeatedly opposed the introduction of income tax. As early as during the Second World War, the government proposed for the introduction of the tax to support the British war effort in Europe and to subsidise the local defence budget. Landale {{was one of the}} members who were appointed to the War Revenue Committee by the government in October 1939, which was tasked to offer advice on the proposed new tax. The Committee later submitted its report in February 1940 in which Landale and other members expressed strong reservations about the <b>tax</b> <b>proposal.</b> Despite of their reservations, the government eventually managed to secure the support of the Committee to introduce the income tax in April 1940, having promised that the tax, as an interim measure to generate war revenue, would be repealed after the war. Ironically, although the government did repeal the tax after the war as promised, the tax was soon re-introduced in 1947, a move which was strongly opposed by Landale and other unofficial members of the Legislative Council. In response to the <b>tax</b> <b>proposal,</b> Landale requested that it should be put on hold for a year to have sufficient time for further review, but his request was turned down by the government. After heated debates, the bill to reintroduce the tax was read a third time and was passed in the Legislative Council in May 1947, notwithstanding that it was rarely voted against by three unofficial members, namely Chau Tsun-nin, Chau Sik-nin and Leo d'Almada e Castro. Landale, however, was compelled to vote for the Bill during the division.|$|E

The King said he would not be willing to do so unless Asquith obtained a clear mandate for such sweeping change by winning a second general election.|$|E

500|$|The sales <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> {{caused a}} rift in the Democratic party {{generally}} and in Laffoon's administration specifically. As presiding {{officer of the}} Senate, Lieutenant Governor A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler had led opposition to the tax in the legislature. Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson sided with Chandler, as did former Laffoon supporters Allie Young and J. Dan Talbott. In retaliation, Laffoon vetoed $7 million in appropriations and a measure to cut property taxes {{at the end of}} the legislative session. Among the few pieces of legislation that passed during the session were bills reorganizing the highway department, making the state Board of Charities a partisan entity, and further removing the Fish and Game Commission from the control of sportsmen. A redistricting bill was hastily passed {{at the end of the}} session, reducing the number of congressional districts from 11 to 9, per the most recent census results, but charges of gerrymandering kept the bill tied up in the courts, preventing it from taking effect in time for the 1932 congressional elections. Consequently, all of Kentucky's representatives that year were elected at-large. The Louisville Courier-Journal called the 1932 legislative session [...] "about the worst legislative session in Kentucky's history".|$|E
500|$|On March 9, 2015, Commander Guasábara {{issued a}} press release where it {{attacked}} the Value Added <b>Tax</b> <b>proposal</b> (better known by its Spanish acronyms [...] "IVA") supported by the Garcia Padilla administration {{as part of its}} response to the Puerto Rican debt crisis. The EPB labeled it as an initiative that promotes the migration of more Puerto Ricans to the United States and as move made by the government to replace the population with foreign millionaires to address the financial decline. The organization expressed its belief that the IVA is a measure that is designed for independent nations and unrealistic for a territory, sacrificing the middle class and small and medium businesses in order to met the demands of bond buyers. Commander Guasábara concluded his exposition by warning against a divided response to the IVA, insisting that only an unified resistance could overcome the government and by warning that the Macheteros would [...] "be there [...] in the right time" [...] if it advanced from the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico and was adopted as law. Facing opposition even within the PPD, the IVA initiative was postponed and instead {{a modified version of the}} current income tax was adopted until it could be reformulated.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{voting to}} place a tax measure on the ballot, local politicians, {{as part of their}} {{responsibilities}} and obligations as members of the governing body of a local government, are supposed to evaluate the merits of a <b>tax</b> <b>proposal.</b> [...] At least one public hearing is also typically held before the governing body of a local government decides whether {{to place a}} <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> on the ballot.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if {{a peanut}} butter {{producer}} purchases a jar manufacturer, {{is that an}} expense (since they have to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of their income through investment? Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. For example, the [...] "9-9-9" [...] flat <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs. (This effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate.) How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax. Thus, a flat <b>tax</b> <b>proposal</b> is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.|$|E

2500|$|Local governments {{frequently}} conduct opinion polling {{of their}} voters before {{deciding whether to}} place a local tax measure on the ballot.
