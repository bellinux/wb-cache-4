5|$|In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, {{appointed}} Flanders to the Business Advisory Council, {{which was}} created to provide input to <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> matters affecting business. The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E

Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|More than 400 student {{clubs and}} {{organizations}} operate on Duke's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides {{most of the}} funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center {{as well as other}} institutional funding sources. One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 , and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016–2017 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by the Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm & Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. The Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. The Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.|$|E

25|$|Because Powell {{was seen}} as more {{moderate}} than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz.

25|$|The {{rebellion}} also {{inspired the}} Jewish Agency {{to expand the}} intelligence-gathering of its Political Department and especially of its Arab Division, with the focus changing from political to military intelligence. The Arab Division set up a network of Jewish controllers and Arab agents around the country. Some of the intelligence gathered was shared with the British administration, the exchange of information sometimes being conducted by Moshe Shertok, then head of the Jewish Agency, directly with the high commissioner himself. Shertok also advised <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> political affairs, on one occasion convincing the high commissioner not to arrest Professor Joseph Klausner, a Revisionist Maximalist activist who had {{played a key role}} in the riots of 1929, because of the likely negative consequences.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1863, Davis {{dispatched}} Stephens on a fruitless {{mission to}} Washington to discuss prisoner exchanges, but the Union victory of Gettysburg made the Lincoln Administration refuse to receive him. As the war continued and {{the fortunes of}} the Confederacy sank lower, Stephens became more outspoken in his opposition to <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>On</b> March 16, 1864, Stephens delivered a speech to the Georgia Legislature that was widely reported in both the North and the South. In it, he excoriated the Davis Administration for its support of conscription and suspension of habeas corpus, and supported a block of resolutions aimed at securing peace. From then {{until the end of the}} war, as he continued to press for actions aimed at bringing about peace, his relations with Davis, never warm to begin with, turned completely sour.|$|E
25|$|President Kennedy had {{submitted}} a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which {{was met with}} strong opposition. Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; {{but if it were}} successful, Johnson would receive ample credit. Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.|$|E
25|$|Rajagopalachari's {{tenure as}} Chief Minister of Madras is largely remembered for the {{compulsory}} introduction of Hindi in educational institutions, {{which made him}} highly unpopular. This measure sparked off widespread anti-Hindi protests, which led to violence in some places and the jailing of over 1,200 men, {{women and children who}} took part in the unrest. Two protesters, Thalamuthu Nadar and Natarasan, were killed during the protests. In 1940, Congress ministers resigned in protest over the declaration of war on Germany without their consent, leaving the governor to take over the reins of <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>On</b> 21 February 1940 the unpopular new law on the use of Hindi was quickly repealed by the Governor of Madras. Despite its numerous shortcomings, Madras under Rajagopalachari was still considered by political historians as the best administered province in British India.|$|E

500|$|Despite Eisenhower's {{interest}} in a deal, his administration was hamstrung by discord among US scientists, technicians, and politicians. At one point, Eisenhower complained that [...] "statecraft was becoming a prisoner of scientists." [...] Until 1957, Strauss's AEC (including its Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories) was the dominant voice in <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> nuclear affairs, with Teller's concerns over detection mechanisms also influencing Eisenhower. Unlike some others within the US scientific community, Strauss fervently advocated against a test ban, arguing that the US must maintain a clear nuclear advantage via regular testing and that the negative environmental impacts of such tests were overstated. Furthermore, Strauss repeatedly emphasized {{the risk of the}} Soviet Union violating a ban, a fear Eisenhower shared.|$|E
500|$|He {{graduated}} from Harvard College in 1665, and was admitted as a freeman in 1672. [...] He {{became a member}} of the general court representing Roxbury in 1673, and he was elected to the colony's council of assistants in 1676. [...] King Philip's War broke out in 1675, and Dudley was a commissioner who accompanied the colonial troops into the field against the Indians. He was present at the Great Swamp Fight in which the Narragansett tribe was decisively defeated. He served for several years as a commissioner to the New England Confederation, and was sent by <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> diplomatic missions to neighboring Indian communities. He served on a committee that negotiated the boundary between Massachusetts and the neighboring Plymouth Colony.|$|E
500|$|The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, {{was not as}} {{aggressive}} in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. [...] It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the President should be impeached. [...] Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore, next in line to the presidency {{in the absence of}} a vice president. [...] Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital. Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. [...] Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.|$|E

500|$|Their {{relationship}} {{began to}} break down over the question of railroad regulation. [...] The President in 1905 sought legislation to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set freight rates; Foraker considered the proposed law unconstitutional, and introduced a bill by which the railroad would set the rates, and if the ICC found they were excessive, it could ask the Attorney General to bring suit. [...] Foraker spoke repeatedly against the administration-favored bill as it moved through the Senate, {{and was one of}} only three senators (and the only Republican) to oppose the resulting Hepburn Act on final Senate passage. [...] As the Ohio legislature had passed a resolution urging Foraker and Dick to vote for the bill, he faced anger at home; one newspaper wrote that Foraker had extinguished his chances of becoming president with his vote. [...] The following year, Foraker also broke with <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>on</b> the question of statehood for Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory, feeling that the two territories should not be combined into one state unless a merger was approved in referenda. [...] Foraker's position prevailed in Congress; despite his stance, Roosevelt signed the resulting bill. [...] The two men also differed on issues of patronage, and on a series of treaties requiring Senate ratification that allowed for international agreements without the need for Senate approval. [...] Roosevelt wrote to a friend that Foraker seemed determine to fight him on every point, good or bad.|$|E
500|$|It {{took some}} time for the {{cautious}} Obama and the blunt, rambling Biden to work out {{ways of dealing with}} each other. In late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak, that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways, led to a swift retraction from the White House. [...] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes, and led to a spate of late-night television jokes themed on him being a loose-talking buffoon. [...] In the face of persistently rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had [...] "misread how bad the economy was" [...] but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. [...] The same month, Secretary of State Clinton quickly disavowed Biden's remarks disparaging Russia as a power, but despite any missteps, Biden still retained Obama's confidence and was increasingly influential within <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>On</b> March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was [...] "a big fucking deal" [...] during live national news telecasts. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs replied via Twitter [...] "And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right..." [...] Senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett said that Biden's loose talk [...] " [...] part of what makes the vice president so endearing ... We wouldn't change him one bit." [...] Former Senate colleague Lindsey Graham said, [...] "If there were no gaffes, there'd be no Joe. He's someone you can't help but like." [...] Biden gained a long-running alter ego persona, [...] "The President of Vice", on the satirical news site The Onion, which parodied his job title. [...] Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.|$|E
