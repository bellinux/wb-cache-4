5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

5000|$|Analysis of the {{resulting}} data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> an estimate of a 5.1 [...] planetary companion orbiting the star at a distance of 0.05 AU with an eccentricity of 0.12.|$|R
50|$|The Strela-1 {{also had}} a warhead over twice as heavy, a {{proximity}} fuze and more effective control surface configuration to provide better maneuverability {{at the cost of}} increased drag. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a missile four times the weight of Strela-2, with only slightly longer reach but otherwise of much better performance.|$|R
25|$|If desired, the {{resulting}} ketone can be subsequently {{reduced to the}} corresponding alkane substituent by either Wolff–Kishner reduction or Clemmensen reduction. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> {{the same as the}} Friedel–Crafts alkylation except that rearrangement is not possible.|$|E
25|$|If {{the number}} of photons being amplified per unit time is greater than {{the number of}} photons being absorbed, then <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a {{continuously}} increasing number of photons being produced; the laser medium is said to have a gain of greater than unity.|$|E
25|$|Borromini was one {{of several}} architects {{involved}} in the building of the church of Sant’Agnese in Agone in Rome. Not only were some of his design intentions changed by succeeding architects but <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a building which reflects, rather unhappily, a mix of different approaches.|$|E
50|$|The court {{rejected}} {{those claims}} {{pointing out that}} the runner up had taken two more AP courses than Hornstine, and while she had taken three more honors courses than the runner up, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a statistical advantage for the runner up.

30|$|Notice {{that the}} great {{advantage}} of FD relaying {{is that it is}} possible to achieve the same maximum spectral efficiency as DT, which is twice the maximum spectral efficiency achieved by HD. However, as the FD relay suffers from self-interference, it is not clear if <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> positive or not. In the next section, we numerically investigate this issue.|$|R
25|$|When the {{air flow}} through the heat sink decreases, this results in an {{increase}} in the average air temperature. This in turn increases the heat sink base temperature. And additionally, the thermal resistance of the heat sink will also increase. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a higher heat sink base temperature.|$|E

The ratio of height between them is 1:2:1. This {{is known as a}} triplet and is an indicator that the proton is three-bonds from a CH2 group.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} inorganic {{reaction is}} double displacement when in mixing of two salts the ions are swapped without {{a change in}} oxidation state. In redox reactions one reactant, the oxidant, lowers its oxidation state and another reactant, the reductant, has its oxidation state increased. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an exchange of electrons. Electron exchange can occur indirectly as well, e.g., in batteries, a key concept in electrochemistry.|$|E
50|$|The {{transport}} {{revolution in}} the region encouraged an influx of business opportunities to a previously sparsely populated area bringing with it work opportunities. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a significant population boom and St Helens grew from a sparsely populated array of manor houses and their tenants in 1700 into a sprawling span of expansive mining operations, forges and pottery manufacturers by the early 19th century.|$|R

In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|R
30|$|Overall the {{decrease}} in producer benefits due {{to the presence of}} planted forests was only one third of the increase in consumer benefits. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> an increase in industry benefits (consumers plus producers) of approximately US$ 77 billion per year, which is approximately one third of the total GDP of Portugal. The largest regional impact of planted forests was observed for Asia, followed by Europe and Africa.|$|R
25|$|The modest acidity of carbons {{adjacent}} to the sulfonyl group has made sulfones useful for organic synthesis. Upon removal of the sulfonyl group with desulfonylation or reductive elimination, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> {{the formation of a}} carbon-carbon bond single or double bond between two unfunctionalized carbons, a ubiquitous motif in synthetic targets. In a synthesis of (–)-anthoplalone, Julia olefination was used to establish the (E)-alkene in the target.|$|E
25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that {{the heat of the}} machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|E
25|$|The {{primary source}} of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of {{hydrogen}} to form helium (the proton-proton chain reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> the fusion of four protons into one alpha particle, {{with the release of}} two positrons, two neutrinos (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the CNO cycle and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent supernova {{at the end of its}} life, a process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E

5000|$|Glen Moore {{argues that}} in 1970, Nixon and the Republican Party {{developed}} a [...] "Southern Strategy" [...] for the midterm elections. The strategy involved depicting Democratic candidates as permissive liberals. Republicans thereby managed to unseat Albert Gore, Sr., of Tennessee, {{as well as}} Senator Joseph D.

5000|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} the station began to {{experience}} trouble. KLYT's programming veered {{away from its}} roots as a Christian music station. Attempts to rebrand KLYT as a [...] "positive" [...] music station without a distinctly religious orientation were not well received by KLYT's listener and contributor base. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> ministry's financial support base severely diminished between 1985 and 1986, bringing on the danger of bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|The {{trans effect}} in square {{complexes}} {{can be explained}} in terms of an addition/elimination mechanism that goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. Ligands with a high trans effect are in general those with high π acidity (as in the case of phosphines) or low-ligand lone-pair–dπ repulsions (as in the case of hydride), which prefer the more π-basic equatorial sites in the intermediate. The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand; due to the principle of microscopic reversibility, the departing ligand must also leave from an equatorial position. The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the trans ligand, so <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest trans effect is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} {{the rates}} from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively {{lower than the}} rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, or they have been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oil—that is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that from Maine to California the general arrangement of open rates on petroleum oil is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors.|$|E
500|$|Roughly {{one million}} {{years after the}} big bang, the first {{generation}} of stars began to form. Within a star, stellar nucleosynthesis results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a steady {{reduction in the number of}} electrons, and a matching increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of stellar evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus. An example is the cobalt-60 (60Co) isotope, which decays to form nickel-60 (...) [...]|$|E

500|$|A sigmatropic {{reaction}} in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction wherein <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> one σ-bond is changed to another σ-bond in an uncatalyzed intramolecular process. The name sigmatropic {{is the result}} of a compounding of the long-established sigma designation from single carbon–carbon bonds and the Greek word tropos, meaning turn. In this type of rearrangement reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system. True sigmatropic reactions are usually uncatalyzed, although Lewis acid catalysis is possible. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [...] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis.|$|E
500|$|Waveguide filter designs {{frequently}} {{consist of}} two different components repeated a number of times. [...] Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. [...] Often, the filter type will take {{its name from the}} style of this component. [...] These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. [...] The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. [...] <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network. [...] Lumped element filters are commonly ladder topology, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. [...] Figure 4 shows such a ladder. [...] Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters {{with the use of a}} band-pass or band-stop transformation.|$|E

Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole.
