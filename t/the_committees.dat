5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have been encouraged by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as <b>the</b> <b>Committees</b> of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. <b>The</b> <b>committees</b> were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>committees</b> {{are governed}} by the Standing Orders of the Senate, {{as well as being}} able to pass their own resolutions to govern certain aspects of their {{operations}} (such as the processing of correspondence and submissions to inquiries).|$|E

5|$|The {{functions}} of committees {{depend on the}} type of committee and on the work it is undertaking. Most of <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> are established under the Senate's Standing Orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work of the regulations and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} {{committees}} of the National Assembly. Committee membership {{is determined by}} the National Assembly. They are responsible for the studying and examination of bills, legislative initiatives, drafts of ordinances and other drafts of legal documents and reports assigned by the National Assembly or the Standing Committee. <b>The</b> <b>committees</b> provide the National Assembly and its Standing Committee with their opinions on the legislative programme. <b>The</b> <b>committees</b> supervise and conduct investigations within their respective competency and exercise powers which are stipulated by law. The National Assembly elects the Ethnic Council, which consists of a Chairman, Deputy Chairmen and other members. The Ethnic Council studies and recommends actions to the National Assembly; the National Assembly has to consult with the Ethnic Council before issuing any decisions on ethnic policy. The Chairman of the Ethnic Council has to attend meetings of the Government which concern ethnic policy. The powers of the Ethnic Council are comparable to those of <b>the</b> <b>committees.</b>|$|E

5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of <b>the</b> <b>committees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Delegates, as {{they waited}} for <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> to {{complete}} their work, spent much of the first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked much reaction, and that only momentary. Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>{{committees}}</b> of the Australian Senate are {{committees of}} Senators, {{established by the}} Australian Senate, for purposes determined by that body.

5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse {{is the case for}} the references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> differ from their {{national}} counterparts as, although smaller {{in comparison to}} those of the United States Congress, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.|$|E
50|$|While {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> {{can be traced}} back into the 19th century, its modern origins began with the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Expenditures in the Executive Departments on April 18, 1921. <b>The</b> <b>Committee</b> on Expenditures in the Executive Department was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Government Operations in 1952, which was reorganized as <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Governmental Affairs in 1978. After passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> became <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and added homeland security to its jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Armed Services <b>Committee</b> {{was created}} by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which {{consolidated}} the functions of two predecessor committees: <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Military Affairs and <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Naval Affairs, which were established as standing committees in 1822. Another predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on <b>the</b> Militia, was created in 1835 and existed until 1911 when it was abolished and its jurisdiction transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Military Affairs. When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 1994, <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on National Security. It was later renamed <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Armed Services.|$|R
50|$|Under the CAA {{there are}} seven <b>committees,</b> namely <b>the</b> Training <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Tournament <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Development <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Publicity <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Facility and Equipment <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Medical Affairs <b>Committee</b> and <b>the</b> Secretariat.

5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

Assigned to <b>the</b> <b>committees</b> on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic floor leader during the session. Davis wrote that his most important work during the session was bank reform.|$|E

As instructed, Cameron placed the nomination for Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman. The nomination was passed unanimously. Later, delegates John H. Roberts of Illinois and Christopher L. Magee of Pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries. Senator Eugene Hale of Maine submitted a resolution for a roll call, in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the people from their delegation serving on the convention's three committees. <b>The</b> <b>committees</b> were formed, and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon.|$|E
