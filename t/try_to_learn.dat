25|$|While the {{hydraulic}} suction anchors cut the bow free, the salvage crews raised several smaller pieces of wreckage. This included {{a piece of}} a torpedo tube weighing about a ton which was analysed to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> if the explosion occurred inside or outside the tube. They salvaged a high-pressure compressed air cylinder weighing about half a ton, {{to learn more about the}} nature of the explosion. They also brought up a part of the cylindrical section of the hard frame and part of the left forward spherical partition, to determine the intensity and temperature of the fire in the forward compartment. Finally, they raised a fragment of the sonar system dome.|$|E
25|$|As they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> {{the mystery}} of the lockdown, they {{encounter}} several playable character allies. With their help they defeat the threatening demon Beldr. This causes the protagonist {{to become a part of}} the War of Bel in order to free the world from the demons making him thus a target for all other Demons that are in competition with him with the seventh day being day in which he will face the next Bel. Through their investigation, the Protagonist and his allies find that the demon outbreak is a result of a planned battle between angels and demons, as a measure to judge the worthiness of mankind. If, after seven days, the demons are not stopped, the angels will destroy mankind. The Japanese government had been aware of this event for years, and had enacted the PSE Law as a safeguard, which embedded remote-controlled electromagnetic devices in every consumer electronics; if the demons outbreak cannot be stopped, the government can use these devices at the last moment to destroy all living things within the quarantine, human and demon alike.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative study between Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Apprenticeship <b>Learning</b> (AL) reduced <b>to</b> classification. IRL and AL are two frameworks for the imitation learning problem where an agent <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from demonstrations of an expert. In AL, the agent <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the expert policy whereas in IRL, the agent <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a reward which {{can explain the}} behavior of the expert. Then, the optimal policy regarding this reward is used to imitate the expert. One can wonder if it is worth estimating such a reward, or if estimating a policy is sufficient. This quite natural question has not really been addressed in the literature so far. We provide partial answers, both from a theoretical and empirical points of view...|$|R

500|$|With September nearly dead, Peter {{decides to}} use Walter's {{equipment}} {{to enter the}} Observer's mind to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> of Olivia's location. Within September's consciousness, Peter learns the Observers are {{a team of scientists}} from one possible future of humanity, having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation. September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes. Ultimately, this would lead to the birth of Henry, Peter's child with the parallel universe's Olivia, which September claimed never should have happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events. By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline, Henry also ceased to exist. September explains that Peter's reappearance may be a means to set things right, and insists he find a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia. As the reality of September's mind breaks down and he claims [...] "they are coming", the Observer tells Peter to [...] "go home". [...] Peter is suddenly woken up in the lab, September's body goes into convulsions and vanishes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} get a {{credible}} looking and sounding band for the film, Davidson hired Kenny Vance, one of the original members of Jay and the Americans.

Vance also told Davidson stories about the band, some of which he incorporated into the script. Tom Berenger has said that he did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> piano for the film but did practice keyboards for hours in his trailer.

He found the photo collection in the attic of a Connecticut house. He and members of his 9315th U.S. Air Force Reserve Squadron were requested by the Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association (CAHA) to conduct research to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> if Whitehead had made powered flights. O'Dwyer continued his research for years and became convinced that Whitehead did fly before the Wright brothers. In a 1981 conversation with O'Dwyer, former CAHA president Harvey Lippincott said, [...] "I cannot {{accept the fact that}} he flew 7 miles, but I can accept the fact that this airplane of his may have flown 100 – 200 feet, 10–15 feet off the ground.
