500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] is the 11th {{episode of}} the sitcom Seinfelds second season on NBC, and is the show's 16th episode overall. The episode {{revolves}} around protagonist Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and his friends Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant, {{on their way to}} see Plan 9 from Outer Space. Unable to get a table, they decide to wait and talk amongst each other, while George tries <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> that is constantly occupied and Jerry recognizes a woman, but he is unsure where he has seen her before.|$|E
500|$|The Earl was {{frequently}} {{depicted in the}} British tabloids for his drug use, wild parties and homosexuality. In May 1983, he was arrested on suspicion of trafficking $4 million of heroin and moved from New York back to Ickworth House. While there, {{on at least one}} occasion, the Earl piloted his helicopter without radar while snorting cocaine off the map he was using for navigation. On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a rubber dinghy {{into the middle of the}} lake at Ickworth and then shot at it with an air rifle, sinking it. On another, he was accused of opening a fridge door to retrieve a bottle of champagne by blasting it with a shotgun. He once drove along the hard shoulder of the M11 motorway at [...] to avoid traffic congestion.|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. David {{came up with the}} idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story was that she was very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a [...] "ticking clock" [...] scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce [...] "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza" [...] was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. [...] "Bonanza" [...] rhymes with [...] "Costanza" [...] and the show's main characters are the [...] "Cartwright" [...] family.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the General Post Office (GPO), whose {{telecommunications}} division {{later became}} British Telecom, had been researching a similar concept {{since the late}} 1960s, known as Viewdata. Unlike Teledata which was a one-way service carried in the existing TV signal, Viewdata was a two-way system <b>using</b> telephones. Since <b>the</b> Post Office owned the telephones, this {{was considered to be}} an excellent way to drive more customers <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones.</b>|$|R

50|$|E.164 Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) is a {{standard}} protocol that {{is the result of}} work of the Internet Engineering Task Force's Telephone Number Mapping working group. ENUM translates a telephone number into a domain name. This allows users <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>phone</b> number formats they are familiar with, while allowing the call <b>to</b> be routed <b>using</b> DNS. This makes ENUM a quick, stable and cheap link between telecommunications systems and the Internet.|$|R
2500|$|However, the [...] "Full National Number" [...] may {{always be}} dialled. [...] In fact, the full [...] "International Number" [...] may always be dialled, since the Australian {{telephone}} network has the [...] "intelligence" [...] to recognise when the destination required is either [...] "International", {{in a different}} [...] "National" [...] area or within the [...] "Local" [...] area and to switch and charge the call accordingly. [...] Thus, it is strongly recommended that telephone numbers should be stored in mobile phones {{in the form of}} the full [...] "International Number", should the owner of the phone be likely <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> concerned in an area away from [...] "home", either within Australia or internationally.|$|E
2500|$|When the escapee's {{car pulled}} {{up near the}} hospital, Ryan walked over to a nearby {{telephone}} box, {{but it had been}} deliberately put out of order, so he walked over to a neighbouring shop and asked <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> there. The owner had been instructed to tell Ryan that his phone was also out of order, and as Ryan walked out of the shop he was tackled by six detectives, dropping a loaded [...]32 revolver that he had been carrying. At the same moment Det. Sgt Fred Krahe thrust a shotgun through the car window and held it at Walker's head, and he was captured without a struggle. Ryan and Walker had been on the run for 19 days. In the boot of the car Police found 3 pistols, a shotgun and two rifles, all fully loaded, an axe, jemmy, two coils of rope, a hacksaw and two boiler suits.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Coulter and Cummings {{knocked on}} the door of {{apartment}} 303. Frechette answered, opening the door two to three inches. She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to call the bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, {{and the two of them}} waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was Johnson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, [...] "I am a soap salesman." [...] Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials. Van Meter said [...] "no," [...] and continued down the stairs. Coulter waited 10 to 20 seconds, then followed Van Meter. As Coulter got to the lobby on the ground floor, Van Meter opened fire on him. Coulter hastily fled outside, chased by Van Meter. Eventually, Van Meter ran back into the front entrance.|$|E

40|$|This study, {{carried out}} among 1397 Flemish high school pupils, {{examines}} whether adolescents’ experience {{of success and}} failure in the school system is related <b>to</b> their <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object. In line with Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory, a conformity, compensation and resistance hypothesis are formulated. The results confirm the conformity hypothesis: conform to the social image that the school system bestows on them, and independent from their social class background, adolescents in academic tracks were less likely <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object. The compensation hypothesis was partially confirmed: adolescents who lag behind in combination with a drop to a non-academic school track, and adolescents with a negative academic self-concept were more likely <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object, but no direct relationship was found with lagging behind. The resistance hypothesis was fully supported: a negative attitude towards school mediates the relationship between lagging behind, school track, academic self-concept and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object. Finally, self-esteem was found to relate positively <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object, which suggests that adolescents who <b>use</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone</b> as a status object have achieved a successful identity in other domains than the academic domain.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} approach to lexieal access from a recognized phone sequence is presented. Lexical access {{is seen as}} finding the word se-quence that maximizes the lexical likelihood of a sequence of phones and durations as recognized by a phone recognizer.

The lexical likelihoods are estimated from training data provided by <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> recognizer <b>using</b> statistical decision trees.

40|$|Mobile <b>phone</b> <b>use</b> {{while in}} <b>the</b> {{presence}} of physical conversational partners {{is a reality}} in modern day life. Many researchers have investigated how different subgroups <b>use</b> mobile <b>phones</b> and <b>the</b> consequences of such <b>use.</b> <b>The</b> goal {{of this research was}} to determine how mobile phones are used in social settings when face-to-face conversations are taking place. The main questions that the research attempted to solve were: (1) If <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>use</b> was related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conversation at hand, (2) if <b>the</b> intensity of <b>phone</b> <b>use</b> was correlated <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was <b>used,</b> (3) and if phones are used during conversations in different ways depending on the relationships and demographics of the conversational partners. The research was conducted in Malmö, Sweden at bars and cafes´ by administering a semi structured verbal interview on people seen using their cell phones while in face-to-face conversations. Relevant demographic information was recorded as well as five open ended questions. The questions were aimed at understanding how <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was <b>used,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> <b>use</b> in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physical conversation. 	The research was conducted <b>using</b> <b>the</b> research paradigm of Positivism and the data was analyzed using an Inductive research strategy. Uses and Gratifications theory was the main theory that this research was viewed through. In addition, relevant information was drawn from various psychological theories as well as problematic mobile <b>phone</b> research. 	<b>The</b> findings show that <b>the</b> majority of <b>phone</b> <b>use</b> is unrelated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conversations at hand. But often this phone use is re-integrated into the conversation at a later time. It was also found that phone <b>use</b> related <b>to</b> information retrieval was most likely {{to be related to the}} face-to-face conversation. Additionally, the data showed that conversational partners that <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> a lot are highly unlikely <b>to</b> be <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> in relation <b>to</b> the conversation.
