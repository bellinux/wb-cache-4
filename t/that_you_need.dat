25|$|The {{two main}} {{pressure}} scales used in static high-pressure experiments are X-ray diffraction of a material with a known {{equation of state}} and measuring the shift in ruby fluorescence lines. The first began with NaCl, for which the compressibility has been determined by first principles in 1968. The major pitfall of this method of measuring pressure is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> X-rays. Many experiments do not require X-rays and this presents a major inconvenience to conduct both the intended experiment and a diffraction experiment. In 1971, the NBS high pressure group was set {{in pursuit of a}} spectroscopic method for determining pressure. It was found that the wavelength of ruby fluorescence emissions change with pressure, this was easily calibrated against the NaCl scale.|$|E

500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career.

500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{an array of}} musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] {{became one of the}} most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with [...] "anti-drug" [...] sentiments, claiming, [...] " [...] is about letting your friends know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." [...] According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was [...] "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." [...] Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.|$|E

Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> me too... best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing".

500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like he went out and told lies."

Cindy White of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, noting that it [...] "lives up to its predecessor and, like the film it spoofs, arguably exceeds it in some ways". John Scott Lewinski of Wired praised the faithfulness to the original film, saying that it [...] "becomes clear that MacFarlane and his writers are legit Star Wars fans". Adam Rosenberg of MTV Movies Blog called the episode [...] "hilarious" [...] and Paul Semel of Metromix praised the episode for featuring [...] "some very ribald humor", and [...] " [...] the original movie with some rather insightful moments". In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" [...] as being a [...] "pretty entertaining parody, and a safe way to wrap things up." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number six on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "almost as good as the first , but much better than the third [...]" [...] He added that the episode is [...] "a bit bizarre on paper, but it works", and noted <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to be a fan of the Star Wars franchise to understand the jokes.|$|E
