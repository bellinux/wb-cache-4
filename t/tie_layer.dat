40|$|Multilayer {{automotive}} fuel lines {{are currently being}} developed in response to stricter environmental legislation governing evaporative emissions. These fuel lines generally have different polymers, an Quter layer (pA 12), a high barrier inner layer (pVdF, THY or PBT) and an adhesive <b>tie</b> <b>layer</b> (modified PA 12) to bond together the outer and inner layers. A range of fuel line polymers were injection moulded and samples immersed in a conventional unleaded fuel, a standard test fuel and fuel components methanol, ethanol and toluene at 20 Ã‚Â°C. Weight gain, swelling and mechanical property analysis showed minimal change for the fluoropolymers but the <b>tie</b> <b>layer</b> resins exhibited gross swelling and significant reduction in mechanical properties. DMTA analysis showed that {{this was due to}} the plasticizing effect ofthe various fluids in the polymer matrices. Elevated temperature immersion studies on nylon 12, PVdF and PBT resins indicated that much higher diffusion coefficients were recorded for the nylon 12 resin, particularly at 600 C. The results also showed that the PVdF exhibited the best barrier performance to these fluids, even at 600 C. A range of multilayer tubes were manufactured at the University and the barrier performance ofthese tubes were determined using an EMS P-tester, the results confirmed that multilayer tubes with a PVdF inner layer exhibited low permeation values. An FTIR-ATR technique was developed to reduce the time tak. ~n to measure the. diffusion of fuel components through polymer films. The results demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients measured using the FTIR-ATR technique correlated well with results obtained using the gravimetric method. The performance of a range of high temperature polymers, PA 4. 6, PEl and (pPEIPA) to selected automotive fluids was also investigated.

40|$|Electrochemical {{polymerisation}} (ECP) of non conducting polymers to form thin, passive {{films on}} electrodes has received attention {{in recent years}} as a potential adhesion promotion technique. Work on carbon electrodes with applications in the carbon fibre composite industry have shown {{that it is possible to}} enhance adhesion of carbon fibres to the composite matrix through ECP pretreatments. ECP to produce passive coatings on metals has also been studied, however much of this work is concerned with production of corrosion inhibiting films, rather than adhesion promoting layers. ECP methods are a promising alternative to the chromate pretreatments and primers presently used to improve the adhesion and corrosion resistance of organic coatings on metals. This is because they can be non toxic, offer the possibility of pinhole free coatings and can be produced insitu, preventing the need for separate processing. Thin, uniform, reproducible polymer coatings based upon poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (glycidyl acrylate) (PGA) were produced on stainless steel cathodes from dilute aqueous sulphuric acid containing potassium persulphate. Electrochemical activities of the solutions were identified by cyclic voltammetry. The polymers were confirmed to be PMMA and PGA by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thickness of the coatings (between 30 and 400 nm) were measured by ellipsometry, and found to increase with increasing treatment time and with less negative electrode potential. The porosity of the coatings was assessed electrochemically and after an annealing treatment the porosity and coating thickness were both found to decrease for the PMMA coatings and remain relatively unchanged for the PGA coatings. The morphology of the ECP coatings were studied by various microscopy techniques. Further characterisation of the PMMA coatings was undertaken in order to clarify the polymerisation mechanism. This involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility studies. A free radical polymerisation mechanism has been proposed in which the radicals are long lived resulting in post electrolysis polymerisation and very high molecular weights. The PMMA and PGA ECP coatings were used as tie layers in adhesion tests by adhering aluminium studs onto the ECP surface with the desired adhesive and subsequently pulling the stud off at a reproducible rate with an Instron tensile testing machine. It was conclusively shown that the adhesion strength between the stainless steel and a cyanoacrylate adhesive was improved by the presence of the PMMA ECP <b>tie</b> <b>layer.</b> In contrast the adhesion of the PMMA ECP <b>tie</b> <b>layer</b> to a standard epoxy adhesive was very poor. The adhesion of the PGA ECP tie layers to the stainless steel substrate was too great to be measured by the standard epoxy adhesive, therefore a toughened adhesive was employed to measure the strength of the interaction between the PGA layers and the stainless steel. This study demonstrates that the ECP technique can be used to improve adhesion of metals to adhesives if the tie layers are chemically compatible with both the metallic oxide and the adhesive. The adhesion is proposed to be improved by increased primary and/or secondary bonding at these interfaces and by excellent interfacial contact between the metallic electrode and the electropolymerised <b>tie</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E

The main barriers for these approaches are high cost, issues with electrical isolation within the Si via {{and the need}} of high investments for new equipment which is not used in WLP up to now.

This Thin Chip Integration (TCI) technology consists {{of one or more}} ultra-thin chips which are stacked on a larger sized standard thick chip and which are interconnected by a thin film routing. The wafer level thinning of the ICs to 20 - 40 mu m leads to the integration of IC into a redistribution.

A standard thin film multilayer which was developed for a redistribution process is realized in a planar fashion on top of the embedded system.

40|$|Multilayer {{coextrusion}} processing {{was applied}} to produce 2049 -layer film of poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) confined against poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using forced assembly, where the PBSA layer thickness was about 60 nm. This unique technology allowed to process semicrystalline PBSA as confined polymer and amorphous PLA as confining polymer in a continuous manner. The continuity of PBSA layers within the 80 / 20 wt % PLA/PBSA layered films was clearly evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Similar thermal events to the reference films were revealed by thermal studies; indicating no diffusion of polymers during the melt-processing. Mechanical properties were measured for the multilayer film and the obtained results were those expected considering the fraction of each polymer, revealing the absence of delamination in the PLA/PBSA multinanolayer film. The confinement effect induced by PLA led to a slight orientation of the crystals, an increase of the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) in PBSA with a densification of this fraction without changing film crystallinity. These structural changes allowed to strongly improve the water vapor and gas barrier properties of the PBSA layer into the multilayer film up to two decades {{in the case of}} CO 2 gas. By confining the PBSA structure in very thin and continuous layers, it was then possible to improve the barrier performances of a biodegradable system and the resulting barrier properties were successfully correlated to the effect of confinement on the microstructure and the chain segment mobility of the amorphous phase. Such investigation on these multinanolayers of PLA/PBSA with the aim of evidencing relationships between microstructure implying RAF and barrier performances has never been performed yet. Besides, gas and water permeation results have shown that the barrier improvement obtained from the multilayer was mainly due to the reduction of solubility linked to the reduction of the free volume while the tortuosity effect, as usually expected, was not really observed. This work brings new insights in the field of physicochemical behaviors of new multilayer films made of biodegradable polyesters but also in interfacial processes due to the confinement effect induced in these multinanolayer structures obtained by the forced assembly coextrusion. This original coextrusion process was a very advantageous technique to produce eco-friendly materials with functional properties without the help of <b>tie</b> <b>layer,</b> additives, solvents, surface treatments, or inorganic fillers...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to deduct the {{composition}} for recycled multilayer film plastic waste and {{how it could be}} compatibilized in theory. The composition analysis was carried out using three different methods: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarized light optical microscopy. Recycled multilayer plastic film samples were provided by Arcada University of applied sciences after initial screening. FTIR and optical microscopy were used on all samples. Some samples had their materials written on the packages. DSC was used only on samples with unknown material composition. Optical microscopy was used to produce cross-section images of the multi-layer films. Layer thicknesses and the number of layers were differentiated from these images. Different plastics exhibit various interference colors with polarized light, thus individual layers could be identified. Top and bottom layers were analyzed by FTIR and then cross-referenced with the data from the layer analysis. Analysis was carried out for 121 samples and 738 layers. This lead to the total thickness of each material used in the sample pool, which was used to further calculate the proportions of each material in relation to volume for different package types and the whole sample pool. The sample pool consisted of 56. 7 % polyethylene (PE), 13. 5 % of polypropylene (PP), 9. 5 % of polyamide- 6 (PA- 6), 7. 8 % of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 4. 5 % of copolymers of PE and PP, 4. 1 % of print, 2. 0 % of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) or <b>tie</b> <b>layers</b> and of 1. 9 % ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH).

The {{identification}} of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow {{better understanding of the}} underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration. Results We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to <b>tie</b> the various <b>layers</b> together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney.

The current work presents the comparison between the results of the first crack loads, the ultimate loads and the deflections in the cases of the impact and static loads. Seventeen plates were damaged under impact load [1], which having the dimensions of 500  ×  500 and 25  mm thick. The plates were subjected to impact load by 1. 15  kg spherical steel ball under its height 1. 12  m {{at the center of the}} tested plates. The ferrocement plates were reinforced with skeletal steel bars welded galvanized meshes and expanded steel meshes with skeletal steel bars. The plates were tested up to failure. The damaged plates were repaired by employing concrete mortar and two layers of galvanized steel mesh (300  *  300  mm) at both the top and bottom faces of the damaged plate and <b>tied</b> with one <b>layer</b> (500  *  500  mm) by means of shear connectors at both top and bottom of the damaged plate by using L screw bolts with imbedded fisher. The rehabilitation plates (500  *  500  *  50  mm) were tested simply supports along its four sides and subjected to central flexural loadings until failure. The obtained results reached emphasized good deformation characteristics, high first crack and ultimate load, high ductility, energy absorption properties, and cracking pattern without spilling of concrete cover that is predominant...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTSeveral {{polymers}} can {{be combined}} in one multilayer structure by reactive coextrusion. Tie-layers are often used to compatibilize adjacent layers and may reduce or suppress interfacialinstabilities and defects in multilayer coextrusion flow. However, a new additional defect defined as“grainy” defect can be observed. In our best of knowledge, no study in literature has been dedicatedto understand its origin. The phenomena are quite complex due to the coupling {{of the effects of}} flowand the physico-chemical mechanisms at the interface. The aim of this work is to understand therelationship between the instabilities and defects encountered in multilayer coextruded films and therole of the copolymer formed in-situ between <b>tie</b> and barrier <b>layers.</b> Polyamide 6 (PA 6) andethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) were used as barrier layers sandwiched in polypropylene(PP) with or without tie-layer based on polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Influence of process parameters and nature of the polymer pair on the generation of “grainy” defecthas been assessed and related to the rheological and the physico-chemical properties of layers. These experiments showed that this defect appeared mainly in the compatibilized EVOH systemand could be distinguished from the usual coextrusion instabilities. Interfacial properties between tieand barrier layers have been investigated. Shear stress relaxation experiments have been carried outon reactive tie/barrier bilayers. Due to the interphase generated in-situ, the relaxation behavior wasaltered by extending the relaxation time. Investigation of interfacial morphology highlighted that thecopolymer architecture significantly affected the interface/interphase development and interfaceroughness. Hence, relationships between relaxation process, interfacial morphology and copolymerstructure were correlated with the generation of grainy defects in coextrusion...|$|R
40|$|Precast Concrete Sandwich Panels (PCSP) are {{proposed}} as an enclosure of modern net-zero energy buildings as they provide high thermal insulation and efficient protection against moisture ingress. A new PCSP system {{has recently been}} developed that consists of two layers of insulation – a 51 mm Polystyrene foam panel and a grooved 25. 4 mm Polystyrene board – sandwiched between two reinforced concrete <b>layers</b> <b>tied</b> together by novel Z-Shape Steel Plate Connectors (ZSPC). Some of these panels are enclosed {{at the top and}} bottom with concrete beams, commonly known as end-beams. The out-of-plane behaviour of PCSP is typically described as: fully composite, partially-composite, or non-composite; depending on the shear strength and stiffness of the interlayer connectors. To investigate the effect of ZSPC and end-beams on the out-of-plane flexural behaviour of the PCSP, six full-size panels having length, width, and thickness of 3. 65 m x 1. 22 m x 0. 23 m, respectively, were constructed and subjected to a four-point flexural loading. The measured moment-curvature responses for all six panels were compared to theoretical non-composite and fully-composite moment-curvature relationships. Test results revealed that PCSP with ZSPC can achieve 60 % to 100 % of the theoretical out-of-plane flexural stiffness of a fully-composite panel. Increasing the shear strength of ZSPC improved the out-of-plane bending moment of PCSP corresponding to the design maximum deflection limit. Adding end-beams to PCSP with even small-size ZSPC improved the out-of-plane bending moment of the panel corresponding to the design deflection limit compared to that of the theoretical fully-composite panel...|$|R
