Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> sympathy.|$|E

500|$|For {{many years}} {{following}} Chamberlain's {{departure from the}} University of Kansas, critics claimed that he either wanted to leave the very white Midwest or was embarrassed by {{not being able to}} bring home the NCAA basketball tournament victory. In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his #13. Around this time, he has been quoted as saying: [...] "There's been a lot of conversation, since people have been trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> jersey number retired, that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas. That is totally ridiculous." ...|$|E

I get in the car and Baby’s my instructor. We’re in Atlanta taking a tour [...] Baby is like, ‘Bow, pull over. Tell this to shorty.’ He tests me on my speaking game with the ladies.

You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jennifer Armstrong {{had mixed}} {{feedback}} on the episode, writing: [...] "The all-medical, all-the-time episodes need to stop." [...] However, she found it [...] "fantastic" [...] when Shepherd drew on the wall, and enjoyed Tahir's character, calling him [...] "lovely". Armstrong also said that [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] was in [...] "ER territory", adding: [...] "I do not watch Grey's Anatomy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> ER fix." [...] Adam Bryant of TV Guide enjoyed this episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson. In his review, he concluded that the installment [...] "proves that Meredith Grey doesn't {{have to do all}} the heavy lifting on this show".|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{collected}} together {{and published by}} Editions Casterman as Objectif Lune in 1953. The title had been Hergé's own choice, having rejected Casterman's suggestion of Tintin and the Nuclear Rocket. For publication in book form, the story was re-coloured, with various changes being made; for instance, in the serialised version, the uniforms worn by staff were green, and they are changed to blue for the book volume. A number of scenes were also deleted. Hergé sent a copy to Ananoff, with a message stating that [...] "Your help, your knowledge, has been invaluable, enabling me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> little characters to the Moon... and {{to bring them back}} safe and sound." [...] An English-language translation of the book was published in 1959.|$|E
500|$|In January 1969, Kennedy {{defeated}} Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin {{to become}} Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by {{the inevitability of}} having {{to run for the}} position; [...] "Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path", Time magazine reported, but [...] "he had a fatalistic, almost doomed feeling about the prospect". The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, [...] "I know that I'm going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> ass shot off one day, and I don't want to." [...] Indeed, there were a constant series of death threats made against Kennedy for {{much of the rest of}} his career.|$|E

She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E
500|$|Wigner {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 [...] "for his {{contributions}} {{to the theory of}} the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles". The prize was shared that year, with {{the other half of the}} award divided between Maria Goeppert-Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen. Wigner professed that he had never considered the possibility that this might occur, and added: [...] "I never expected <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> name in the newspapers without doing something wicked." [...] He also won the Franklin Medal in 1950, the Enrico Fermi award in 1958, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, the Max Planck Medal in 1961, the National Medal of Science in 1969, the Albert Einstein Award in 1972, and the eponymous Wigner Medal in 1978. In 1968 he gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture.|$|E
