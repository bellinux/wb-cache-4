5000|$|Following Alicia's resignation, Lily's colleagues {{accused her}} of {{bullying}} Alicia, making her briefly feel guilty. Yu explained that Lily felt guilty, but believed that because of her bad experience being mentored by Martin Ashford (Patrick Robinson), Alicia should receive the same treatment from her. Lily realises that she has {{made a mistake in}} her actions towards Alicia, but it is too late and it [...] "gets to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she's</b> way beyond saying sorry". Yu disliked filming scenes <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was mean to Halfpenny as they were friends off-screen.|$|R

Her {{physical}} and mental condition weakened by atherosclerosis, {{she was unable to}} travel to the US to receive the Enrico Fermi prize and relatives had to present it to her. After breaking her hip in a fall and suffering several small strokes in 1967, Meitner made a partial recovery, but eventually was weakened to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> moved into a Cambridge nursing home.|$|E

Onondaga continued patrol operations based out of New London until 1920, at which time she transferred to Baltimore. She continued to operate out of Baltimore until 1 January 1923, when she was placed out of commission at the Coast Guard Depot for repairs. Funding for needed repairs was never received and her condition gradually deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had to be sold for scrap.

500|$|Zero has {{received}} a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> breaks <b>the</b> fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she [...] "related to [...] as the game progressed, which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into [...] "a jet-black comedy", comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort: while both unlikable characters, there was [...] "something magnetic about their horribleness". Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying [...] " [...] was drawn into [...] world and its cast of characters, and I wanted to see Zero's journey through from start to finish." [...] This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps what Berossus omits {{to mention}} is also noteworthy. Much {{information}} on Sargon (c. 2300 BC) {{would have been}} available during his time (e.g., a birth legend preserved at El-Amarna and in an Assyrian fragment from 8th century BC, and two Neo-Babylonian fragments), but these were not mentioned. Similarly, the great Babylonian king Hammurabi (ca. 1750 BC) merits only passing mention. He did, however, mention that the queen Semiramis (probably Sammuramat, wife of Samshi-Adad V, 824811 BC) was Assyrian. Perhaps it {{was in response to}} Greek writers mythologising her to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was described as the founder of Babylon, daughter of the Syrian goddess Derketo, and married to Ninus (the legendary founder of Nineveh, according to Greek authors).|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} {{confrontation}} with Loki that brought together the founding Avengers, it is Janet and Hank who propose forming {{a team of}} superheroes. Janet suggests the name for the team and becomes a founding member. Never lacking confidence or bravery and by nature an outgoing personality, Janet is always {{in the thick of}} battles with villains, who include Norse gods and aliens, despite being the most underpowered member of the team. Janet frequently comments on the attractiveness of her male colleagues, especially Thor, in order to provoke jealousy from Hank and get him to commit to a relationship. Early on in her Avengers career, she is seriously wounded by a stray bullet in battle against Count Nefaria, and nearly dies from a collapsed lung. She leaves the team several issues later. When she returns in Avengers vol. 1 #26, her shrinking powers have progressed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> no longer needs Pym particle capsules to change her size.|$|E
25|$|During this time, she was {{in great}} demand and very {{successful}} in Paris as France's most popular entertainer. After the war, she became known internationally, touring Europe, the United States, and South America. In Paris, she gave Atahualpa Yupanqui (Héctor Roberto Chavero) – a central figure in the Argentine folk music tradition – the opportunity to share the scene, making his debut in July 1950. She helped launch the career of Charles Aznavour in the early 1950s, taking him on tour with her in France and the United States and recording some of his songs. At first she met with little success with U.S. audiences, who expected a gaudy spectacle and were disappointed by Piaf's simple presentation. After a glowing 1947 review in the New York Herald Tribune by the influential New York critic Virgil Thompson, himself a contributor to international avant garde culture, however, her popularity grew, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> eventually appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times and at Carnegie Hall twice (1956 and 1957).|$|E

5000|$|Lily {{continues}} to be critical and confrontational of Alicia whilst claiming only {{to be trying to}} attain better performance from her mentee. Alicia saves a patient's life in difficult circumstances outside of the hospital. But Lily dismisses her heroics and launches a verbal attack on Alicia in front of other Emergency Department staff. At the same time Lily had been dealing with the aftermath of her father's sudden death. Yu told Ellis that [...] "explored those extreme emotions without worrying about anything else. That scene in resus is an explosion of all the emotions Lily has been feeling - it's just a shame that Alicia is {{on the receiving end of}} it." [...] Senior nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) witnesses Lily's behaviour and compares the situation to when Ash was bullying her. Yu believed that Lily felt remorse when she recalled how she had felt. But Lily realises that she has gone too far and [...] "it gets to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she's</b> way beyond saying sorry." [...] Lily's treatment results in Alicia resigning from her position owing her decision to Lily bullying her. Yu hated being mean to Halfpenny during the filming of Lily and Alicia's clashes because they were friends off-screen.|$|R

25|$|At this point, Vyjayanthimala made {{comeback}} to Tamil films, {{where she}} tasted commercial success with Vanjikottai Valiban, Irumbu Thirai, Baghdad Thirudan and Then Nilavu. In 1961, {{the release of}} Dilip Kumar's Ganga Jumna saw her playing a rustic village belle Dhanno who speaks Bhojpuri dialect. Critics applauded her performance, while some labeled it her best till date. She won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress {{for her role in}} Ganga Jumna. Beginning from 1962, most of her films performed either averagely or poorly at the box office. However, in 1964, with the success of Sangam, her career hits the peak again. She reinvented herself playing a modern Indian girl appearing in revealing costumes and a one-piece swimsuit. She went to receive her third Best Actress Award at the 12th Filmfare Awards for her role as Radha in Sangam. She later achieved critical acclaim for her performance in the historical drama Amrapali, which was based on the life of Nagarvadhu, royal courtesan of Vaishali, Amrapali. The film received universal acclaim, but it was a huge box office failure, which left Vyjayanthimala, who had huge expectations of the film, disenchanted to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> decided to quit films. In the end of her career Vyjayanthimala was mostly seen in commercially successful films such as Suraj, Jewel Thief and Prince with a few critically acclaimed films such as Hatey Bazarey and Sunghursh. Most of them were released after Vyjayanthimala had left the film industry.|$|E

5000|$|Charles the Bad, having {{fallen into}} such a state of decay {{that he could not}} make use of his limbs, {{consulted}} his physician, who ordered him to be wrapped up from head to foot, in a linen cloth impregnated with brandy, so that he might be inclosed [...] in it to the very neck as in a sack. It was night when this remedy was administered. One of the female attendants of the palace, charged to sew up the cloth that contained the patient, having come to the neck, <b>the</b> fixed <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was to finish her seam, made a knot according to custom; but as there was still remaining an end of thread, instead of cutting it as usual with scissors, she had recourse to the candle, which immediately set fire to the whole cloth. Being terrified, she ran away, and abandoned the king, who was thus burnt alive in his own palace.|$|R
500|$|The first story, [...] "Far From Yokohama", {{features}} Mitsuko (Youki Kudoh) and Jun (Masatoshi Nagase), {{a teenage}} couple from Yokohama making {{a pilgrimage to}} Memphis during a trip across America.

I should think that she would do so; she would not be likely to put into Gibraltar, although, from what you tell me, the owner would believe that no suspicion whatever of being concerned in this affair would be likely to rest upon him. But you must bear in mind that it is probable that, as a measure of precaution, he has painted out the white streak, sent down the yards, and converted her into a fore-and-aft schooner; in which case she would attract no attention whatever if she passed without making her number." ...|$|R
