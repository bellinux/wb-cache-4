She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I knew what she was trying <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E

Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".|$|E

He was buried five days after his death – {{on the eve of}} his 45th wedding anniversary – at the Dissenter's burial ground in Bunhill Fields, in what is today in the Borough of Islington, London. His parents were interred in the same grounds. Present at the ceremonies were Catherine, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, Frederick Tatham and John Linnell. Following Blake's death, Catherine moved into Tatham's house as a housekeeper. She {{believed}} she was regularly visited by Blake's spirit. She continued selling his illuminated works and paintings, but entertained no business transaction without first [...] "consulting Mr. Blake". On the day of her death, in October 1831, she was as calm and cheerful as her husband, and called out to him [...] "as if he were only in the next room, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> coming to him, and it would not be long now".|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{also began}} collaborating with Bill Dees, {{whom he had}} known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote [...] "It's Over", a {{number one in the}} UK, and a song that would be one of his {{signature}} pieces {{for the rest of his}} career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, [...] "A pretty woman never needs any money". Just 40 minutes later, [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet [...] "mercy" [...] Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the US and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It hit number one in the UK as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, [...] "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many {{of their}} contemporaries, Vicky and Frederick {{rejected}} antisemitism. In a letter to her mother, the Crown Princess harshly criticised the essay Das Judenthum in der Musik (Judaism in Music) by Richard Wagner, whom she considered ridiculous and unfair. As for Frederick, he {{did not hesitate to}} make public appearances in synagogues when manifestations began of hatred against the Jews in Germany, especially in the early 1880s. In 1880-1881, there was a campaign waged by the Völkisch movement to disemancipate German Jews, led by the Lutheran Pastor Adolf Stoecker and the historian Heinrich von Treitschke, leading to a quarter of million Germans signing a petition asking the government to ban all Jewish immigration, forbid Jews from holding public office, to work as teachers and from attending universities, which was a mere prelude to their ultimate goal of the völkisch activists of stripping Jews of their German citizenship. Both Stoecker and Treitschke were very popular and well respected men in Germany, and their anti-Semitic campaign attracted much support from the Prussian Army officer corps, university students and the court, but the Crown Princess was fearless in attacking the anti-Semitic leaders, writing that [...] "Treitschke and his supporters are lunatics of the most dangerous sort". In another letter, Victoria suggested that Stoecker and his followers belonged in a lunatic asylum, since so much of {{what he had to say}} reflected an unbalanced mind. In yet another letter, the Crown Princess wrote she had become ashamed of her adopted country as Stoecker and Treitschke [...] "behave so hatefully towards people of a different faith and another race who have become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!". Victoria and her husband, the latter wearing the uniform of a Prussian field marshal, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for the German Jews threatened by what Victoria called Treitschke's [...] "disgraceful" [...] attacks. In 1881, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess attended a synagogue service in Wiesbaden [...] "to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are" [...] just as the Reichstag was beginning to debate the issue of Jewish disemancipation. The Crown Princess's mother, Queen Victoria was proud of her daughter and son-in-law's efforts to stop the völkisch campaign, writing to Frederick <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> happy that her daughter had married a man like him, who was prepared to stand up for the rights of the Jews. In both the Kronprinzenpalais and Neues Palais in Potsdam, the Crown Princely couple received many commoners, including some Jewish personalities, which inevitably led to the disapproval of the Emperor and the court. Among their guests were the physicians Hermann von Helmholtz and Rudolf Virchow, the philosopher Eduard Zeller and the historian Hans Delbrück. The reactionary and anti-Semitic Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee felt so threatened by the prospect of Frederick becoming Emperor and Victoria Empress that he planned, were Frederick to ascend to the throne, to have the military stage a coup d'état in favor of his son Prince Wilhelm; to have Victoria expelled back to Britain and to have her executed if she ever returned to Germany; to end universal manhood suffrage for the Reichstag; and to have Germany launch a war to [...] "take out" [...] France, Austria and Russia (the fact that the Germany was allied to the last two did not matter to Waldersee). Only the fact that Frederick was already dying of cancer when he become Emperor in 1888 kept Waldersee from going ahead with his plans for a putsch.|$|E
