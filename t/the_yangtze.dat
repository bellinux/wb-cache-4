In Kublai's absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.|$|E
5|$|She {{arrived in}} Chinese waters in late September, and was {{assigned}} to the blockade of the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> She spent the period from 14 February to 3 March 1901 in the German concession at Tsingtao, after which she returned to <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> The blockade of the river ended in June, and on 10 June she returned to Tsingtao. From 4 September to 11 November, she underwent an overhaul in Shanghai. She then returned to Tsingtao and <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> area, before riots in Zhejiang province forced her to steam to Ningpo to assist in suppressing the unrest on 9 April 1902. On 16 April, she left for repairs at Shanghai. On 23 July, while Schwalbe was moored in Tsingtao, she received the order to return to Germany. On 16 August, she departed Tsingtao and arrived in Danzig on 10 December. There, she was decommissioned a second time three days later. Another lengthy overhaul followed, which lasted from 1903 to 1905 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E

Wanyan Liang was assassinated in a military camp by his own men shortly after the Caishi battle. A military coup {{had taken place in}} the Jin court while Wanyan Liang was absent, enthroning Emperor Shizong as the new emperor. A peace treaty signed in 1165 ended the conflict between Song and Jin.|$|E

5|$|By 1127, Jin had conquered most of {{northern}} China and besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of the Song was captured. The Jurchens took {{him and the}} Song royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of the Song court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in the Song southern capital (modern Shangqiu), and then in Hangzhou in 1129. The move of the Song capital south to Hangzhou signals {{the transition from the}} Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozong. The Jurchen general Wuzhu crossed <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze,</b> where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by Han Shizhong.|$|E

After the work was completed, she steamed to Tsingtao in the German Kiautschou Bay concession, where she took part in training exercises {{with the rest of the}} expeditionary force.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs, {{otherwise}} known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought {{at the end of}} the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.|$|E
5|$|The Jin persisted {{with their}} advance into the {{remaining}} Song territories south of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> They faced an insurgency of Song loyalists in the north, {{the deaths of}} some important leaders, and military offensives by Song generals like Yue Fei. The Jurchens created the puppet government of Da Qi {{to serve as a}} buffer state between Song and Jin, but Qi failed to defeat the Song. The Jin abolished Qi in 1137. As the Jin gave up on conquering the Southern Song, diplomatic talks for a peace treaty resumed. Signed in 1142, the Treaty of Shaoxing established the boundary between the two states along the Huai River, which runs north of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> The treaty forbade the Song from purchasing horses from the Jin, but smuggling continued in the border markets. The relations between the two states were mostly peaceful from 1142 to 1161, the year Wanyan Liang went to war.|$|E

50|$|Samuel Cornell Plant (8 August 1866 - 26 February 1921) {{was best}} known as the first to command a {{merchant}} steamer plying on <b>the</b> Upper <b>Yangtze</b> River in 1900. <b>The</b> Upper <b>Yangtze</b> is <b>the</b> section of river stretching through gorges from Yichang to Chongqing. Plant later collaborated with Chinese merchants and the government to create Sichuan Steam Navigation Company, serving as Captain of SS Shutung and SS Shuhun, providing the first regular merchant steam service on <b>the</b> Upper <b>Yangtze.</b> He is further recognized for his contributions as Chinese Maritime Customs’ First Senior River Inspector on <b>the</b> Upper <b>Yangtze.</b> Plant installed <b>the</b> river's navigational marks, established signaling systems, wrote a manual for shipmasters, and trained hundreds of foreign and Chinese pilots.|$|R

5|$|The {{remaining}} Song forces regrouped {{under the}} self-proclaimed Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) and withdrew south of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> {{to establish a}} new capital at Lin'an (modern Hangzhou).

5|$|Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) led a coup against Emperor Xizong {{and became}} fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang {{presented}} {{himself as a}} Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that {{was the source of}} widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze.</b> The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.|$|E

5|$|A {{large dam}} across <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, the dam {{is intended}} to increase <b>the</b> <b>Yangtze</b> River's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
