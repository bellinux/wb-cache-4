It describes a fourth mode, <b>tubular</b> <b>transportation,</b> which possesses the characteristics necessary to overcome these limitations and reduce unit cost of transportation in a high-volume market. The purpose of the thesis {{is to show that}} the new method can provide cost and speed breakthroughs required to meet expanding future needs, and that these breakthroughs are not possible with existing systems. Total necessary investments, operating costs, expected fare and costs, and capacities for a typical 300 -mile system are examined for each mode. The data collected for the study were obtained through research at the San Fernando Valley State College Library and the Los Angeles public libraries. Also of particular value were the technical papers, periodical literature, personal interviews and correspondence, published tariff schedules of various transportation companies, and various government publications. No attempt is made to determine potential breakthroughs in existing modes of transportation, although the literature review??ed does not show any significant reductions in unit costs of transportation. In fact, the government accounting methods for accumulating variable(line-haul) costs and indirect or fixed (fully distributed) costs appear to offer little chance of reduction. The thesis concludes that a significant reduction in transportation costs, along with reduced travel time, greater schedule flexibility, and other benefits are possible through a system of high speed <b>tubular</b> <b>transportation...</b>|$|E
