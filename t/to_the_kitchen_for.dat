25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} of the good order of the house during the time of Richard de Morins; he would {{scarcely}} have been chosen twice to visit other houses unless he had ruled his own with care and diligence. During his forty years of office canons of Dunstable were at least five times elected priors to other monasteries of the order—at Caldwell, St. Frideswide's, Ashby and Coldnorton. Bishop Grosseteste visited the house once in 1236, not so much to inquire into the daily life of the priory as to investigate its title to several appropriate churches; but he exacted an oath on this occasion from all the canons individually, and one of them fled to Woburn rather than submit to it. The bishop came again in 1248, while Geoffrey of Barton was prior; when the cellarer, accused by many, fled before his coming to Merivale; but he {{does not seem to have}} found fault with the convent in general, and his next visit in 1250 was for purposes of his own. Archbishop Boniface came in 1253, but made no complaint. In 1274 Bishop Gravesend sent a canon of Lincoln to visit Dunstable, who left his corrections in writing; and in Advent of the same year he made a personal visitation. In November 1279 Bishop Sutton came and discharged his office 'strictly and without respect of persons.' The sub-prior and certain others were removed from their charge, and forbidden to hold office in future, and certain 'less useful members' of the household expelled; in May of the following year he deposed the prior, William le Breton, from all pastoral care. It seems most likely that these depositions were on account of mismanagement rather than for any personal failings; the great necessity and heavy debts of the house called for stringent measures, and William le Breton had shown himself (like Abbot Richard of Woburn in a similar case) unable to meet the difficulty. There is no sign of any other grave faults having been committed, nor of anything like luxurious living. The new prior, according to the bishop's advice, set himself to limit the expenses of the whole house and assigned a fixed income <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> the future; the deposed prior had a proper maintenance assigned to him at Ruxox. The canons seem to have borne no ill-will to Bishop Sutton for his corrections, and were ready on his next visit to their church (which was made not officially but only in passing) to praise him for his excellent sermon. Other visitations of his are mentioned in 1284, 1287, 1288, and 1293; the last was only to confer orders. Archbishop Peckham came in 1284, but found all well ('as the bishop had been there quite lately,' the chronicler naively remarks); and Archbishop Winchelsea in 1293. The only serious charge that could be laid to the door of the canons all through the thirteenth century was their inability to keep clear of debt; and the record shows that this was often quite as much their misfortune as their fault. There are many incidental remarks of the chroniclers which serve to show that the tone of the house was thoroughly religious, and that the canons were faithful in keeping their rule. It will suffice to instance, early in the century, the generous treatment of the two young canons (one only a novice), who escaped by night through a window and went to join the Friars Minor at Oxford. They were indeed solemnly excommunicated and compelled to return; but after they had done their penance in the chapter house and had been absolved, they were allowed a year to consider the matter, and if after that time they preferred the stricter order, they were granted permission to depart; if not, they might remain at Dunstable. A good deal later than this, in 1283, the apologetic way in which the chronicler relates how the prior went out to dinner with John Durant is sufficient to show that the ordinary rules and customs of the order were not commonly broken.|$|E

50|$|By 1960, McCully {{had become}} an icon in the food industry, {{bringing}} noted chefs together, serving as a mentor, a contact with peers, and hosting regular culinary salons in her Upper East Side apartment. Though she had a somewhat abrasive manner, McCully was very influential counting among her friends both American and foreign chefs.

While running <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>for</b> McCall's magazine, she allowed Beard <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>for</b> his cooking school and helped many chefs gain notice. When Julia Child first envisioned writing articles on French cooking and publishing cookbooks, McCully told her that though the recipes were well constructed, they would seem overwhelming to most cooks. When Child finally agreed that the recipes must be simplified, she still had trouble finding a publisher. McCully read the manuscript for Mastering the Art of French Cooking {{and gave it to}} Jacques Pépin, for whom she had become a surrogate mother, telling him she thought it had merit.

40|$|The author had {{a special}} <b>kitchen</b> knife made <b>for</b> {{children}} {{with a view to}} improving proficiency in group lessons of skill learning. When designing the knife，the author paid attention to its size and weight in view of children's hands and fingers as well as their grip force. <b>To</b> determine <b>the</b> effect of this knife on skill learning，I compared the degree of proficiency such as the cutting time as well as the number and thickness of cut pieces，using three different knives：a special kitchen knife designed by <b>the</b> author，a full-size <b>kitchen</b> knife available in the market，and a peeling knife which is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ordinary <b>kitchen</b> knife <b>for</b> children in terms of size and weight．The comparison shows that children were able to cut objects thinner in a shorter time with the peeling knife as well as <b>the</b> special <b>kitchen</b> knife than with <b>the</b> full-size <b>kitchen</b> knife．A part from the cutting results，the movement of cutting when dealing with objects of differing degrees of hardness was also analyzed to compare and review respective knife movement. The results of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> knife movement analysis shows that the individual differences of non－cutting time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> knife <b>for</b> children，which is an idling time from the moment of finishing cutting one piece <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moment of moving on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next，were less varied compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peeling knife.

He began the day thus because there was not time to go far afield before his lessons.

6000|$|Once when {{staying with}} my uncle at Rosses Point {{where he went}} for certain months of the year, I called upon a cousin towards midnight {{and asked him to}} get his yacht out, for I wanted to find what sea birds began to stir before dawn.

It was for the poem that became fifteen years afterwards [...] "The Shadowy Waters" [...] that I had wanted the birds' cries, and it had been full of observation had I been able to write it when I first planned it.

Years afterwards when I had finished [...] "The Wanderings of Oisin," [...] dissatisfied with its yellow and its dull green, with all that overcharged colour inherited from the romantic movement, I deliberately reshaped my style, deliberately sought out an impression as of cold light and tumbling clouds. I cast off traditional metaphors and loosened my rhythm, and recognizing that all the criticism of life known to me was alien and English, became as emotional as possible but with an emotion which I described to myself as cold.
