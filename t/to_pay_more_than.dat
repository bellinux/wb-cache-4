5|$|On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings {{announced}} not {{to renew}} their existing deal with Viacom. Since then, Viacom's deal with Netflix expired and removed its shows such as SpongeBob, and Dora the Explorer. However, SpongeBob is still available to stream on Netflix in Canada. On June 4, 2013, Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement moving its programmings, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com, Netflix's top competitor. Amazon agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $200 million to Viacom for the license, its largest subscription streaming transaction ever.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 the Arden Group {{settled with}} One Meridian Plaza's owners E/R Partners <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> US$13 {{million for the}} site. In 1999 Arden sued E/R Partners for backing out of a deal Arden said it had made with the site owners. E/R Partners had wanted to sell the site to Liberty Property Trust for a higher amount. Arden had already bought the {{adjacent}} Two Mellon Plaza in 1993. Damaged and vacant since the One Meridian Plaza fire, Two Mellon Plaza was converted into a Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2000. Also adjacent to {{the south side of}} the One Meridian Plaza site is 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner Commercial Properties bought the property which contained the site of several three-story shops and the eighteen-story Morris Building, all damaged and vacant due to the One Meridian Plaza fire. The buildings were demolished in 2000. The north side of the One Meridian plaza site faces Philadelphia City Hall across the street. While the One Meridian Plaza site waited for development Arden converted it into an underground parking garage.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E

50|$|Individuals who are tax {{resident}} in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one country may be liable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tax <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{once on the}} same income.

50|$|Keynes also {{believed}} that Germany would be unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2 billion marks in reparations for the next 30 years, but Mantoux contends that German rearmament spending was seven {{times as much as}} that figure in each year between 1933 and 1939.|$|R

25|$|Dean {{opposed the}} use of taxpayer-financed {{vouchers}} for tuition at parochial or other private schools, and promised to rework federal annual testing in grades 3 through 8 while allowing for more state and local control. Dean also guaranteed that people would not have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 {{percent of their income}} toward loans after post-secondary graduation as Dean would provide $10,000 a year in federal aid for university or high-skills learning.|$|E
25|$|These {{securitization}} trusts may {{be structured}} by government-sponsored enterprises {{as well as}} by private entities that may offer credit enhancement features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the required monthly payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety (prepayment), the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.|$|E
50|$|Temettu {{was paid}} annually; {{it was a}} {{graduated}} tax, with the rich liable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> considerably <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the poor. By 1910, temettu revenue had reached 1 million livres per year; the same as tobacco and petrol duties, and less than the revenue from customs.|$|R

25|$|FWTA also {{operates}} a vanpool/carpool service. A vanpool/carpool {{is a group}} of at least seven people who share the costs of getting to and from work. These individuals usually live and work near each other. Monthly fares will vary, depending on the origination point of the van and the daily miles involved. Riders pay only for the portion of the trip they use. For instance, if the service picks up riders in different counties, it's possible for some riders <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> others.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 1983, the U.S. Department of Labor {{settled a}} portion of its case against the former {{trustees}} of the Central States Pension Fund. Several insurance companies agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $6.75 million to the fund. Presser {{was not involved in}} the settlement, and the civil suit against him continued. But the same day DOL claimed victory against pension fund graft, Presser told FBI agents that organized crime still controlled the pension fund. In 1984, Presser and the remaining trustees settled their personal liability suit for $2 million.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{answered}} {{both questions}} in the negative. The majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, in separate decisions, applied the decision in the Sawmillers case, holding that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with a State law. There were two fundamental propositions that were central to the judgments of the majority, (1) the reserved powers doctrine that power to regulate the domestic trade and commerce was reserved to the State and that the Australian parliament could not invade that sphere and (2) that arbitration was the exercise of judicial power and that the Arbitration Court was required to determine the matter according to law, including State law. Section 109 of the Constitution, did not apply because the Arbitration Court was required to declare and administer the law, not make it, thus an award made by the Arbitration Court was not a federal law that would prevail over a State law. Discontent with a State law was not an industrial dispute between employees and their employer. On the question of inconsistency the majority held the question was whether {{it was impossible to}} obey both laws. Because an employer could agree <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the State minimum wage, the Arbitration Court could order the employer <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the minimum.|$|E

50|$|Bankruptcy {{for profit}} will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low {{penalties}} for abuse give owners an incentive <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> themselves <b>more</b> <b>than</b> their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations.

25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK), people who have keratoconus could be expected <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $25,000 over their lifetime post-diagnosis, {{with a standard deviation of}} $19,396. There is limited evidence on the costs of corneal cross-linking, a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK National Health Service, but this may be as high as $2,500 per eye in other countries. A 2013 cost-benefit analysis by the Lewin Group for Eye Bank Association of America, estimated an average cost of $16,500 for each corneal transplant.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{rehabilitation}} {{methods have}} also been seen to present difficulties to those participating in them. At times these difficulties keep anywhere from 30%–66% of people from reaching their goals for their therapy. When the goals are not achieved people are generally made to participate in longer therapy sessions, more therapy sessions, or more in-depth and difficult sessions than before, such as constraint-induced movement therapy. In each of these cases, patients are generally forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> before and are also put through more work than they initially planned. It has been found through research, however, that virtual reality situations can likely increase a person's desire to participate in therapy and therefore increase their chances of reaching their therapy goals, unlike those left underachieved with regular methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{contradictory}} mandates {{of the two}} {{federal agencies}} involved, the USFWS and the U.S. Forest Service are exemplified in what the Rosebud Sioux tribe experienced: The ferret was reintroduced by the USFWS, which according to the tribe promised <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $1 million a year through 2010. On the other hand, the tribe was also contracted for the U.S. forest service prairie dog poisoning program. The increasing numbers of ferrets led to conflicts between the tribe's Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Game, Fish and Parks Department and the Tribal Land Enterprise Organization. When the federal government started {{an investigation of the}} tribe's prairie dog management program, threatening to prosecute tribal employees or agents carrying out the management plan in the ferret reintroduction area, the tribal council passed a resolution in 2008, asking the two federal agencies to remove ferrets, and reimburse the tribe for its expenses for the ferret recovery program.|$|E

5000|$|After 1937, Battles {{hoped for}} a raise in salary.

500|$|A U.S. {{jury trial}} {{was held on}} July 30, 2012, with Apple {{prevailing}} and Samsung ordered <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $1 billion in damages, after which Samsung stated: [...] "This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, {{some of which have}} already rejected many of Apple's claims." [...] Judge Lucy H. Koh later decided that the jury had miscalculated $450 million in its initial damage assessment and ordered a retrial that commenced in November 2013. Following a week-long trial, also overseen by Judge Koh, Samsung was ordered to pay $600 million to Apple for the 2012 lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|The Allied {{delegation}} initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane {{addition to}} the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests. Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that [...] "the legal interpretation [...] was the correct one" [...] and {{not a matter of}} political question. Lloyd George commented that [...] "the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we all think she will be unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> this document requires of her." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode.

I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!" ...|$|E
