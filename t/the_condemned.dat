5|$|Roberto Busó-García {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the dramatic film, <b>The</b> <b>Condemned</b> (2013), which he said was loosely based on the Rhoads' controversy in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|In {{the castle}} grounds are {{the graves of}} those {{executed}} here for various crimes. They have simple markers featuring only the initials of <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> and the date of death. William Frederick Horry is buried in the Lucy Tower, {{along with many other}} criminals' graves.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{attacks were}} <b>condemned</b> by many governments around the world. <b>The</b> United Nations <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> killings [...] "in the strongest {{possible}} terms,"and the French Council of the Muslim Faith also <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> attacks.|$|R

5|$|After Foxton's {{death in}} 1829 the {{government}} appointed Calcraft the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex. Following this, his executioner services were in great demand throughout England. Nevertheless, some considered Calcraft incompetent, in particular for his controversial {{use of the}} short-drop hanging method in which <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> were slowly strangled to death.|$|E
5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> {{took several}} minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would {{sometimes}} dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, the phrase has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer {{for the soul of}} <b>the</b> <b>condemned.</b> However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it has only been said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Macrostich <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> {{teachings of}} Marcellus and Photinus.|$|R
5000|$|The Synod of Gangra {{was held}} in 340. <b>The</b> synod <b>condemned</b> Manichaeans, and their practices. The {{concluding}} canons of <b>the</b> Synod <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> Manichaeans for their actions, and declared many of their practices anathematised.|$|R
50|$|Mansur, {{said he was}} ostracized {{after writing}} columns for <b>the</b> <b>condemning</b> <b>the</b> Taliban and {{comparing}} it to the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia. According to Mansur, the severe backlash has prompted him to stop going to his local mosque.|$|R
5|$|Maria {{began an}} {{on-screen}} romance with Santino Marella in June 2007. On the November 5 episode of Raw, Marella {{was confronted by}} the returning Stone Cold Steve Austin for criticizing his movie, <b>The</b> <b>Condemned.</b> As {{a part of the}} storyline, the argument ended as Marella received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin.|$|E
5|$|One {{account of}} the executions states that some of <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> were still alive when their bodies were burned, and that the executioners {{borrowed}} a walking stick from an onlooker with which to push their victims' moving limbs back into the fire; its owner refused {{to take it back}} after it had been in contact with witches.|$|E
5|$|The {{sentences}} provoked international {{criticism and}} {{protests against the}} Spanish government. Large demonstrations took place in Italy, Stockholm and Oslo, with the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, heading the Swedish demonstration. The Dutch foreign minister made a formal protest to the Spanish Ambassador. The Spanish Embassy in Lisbon was attacked and set on fire. The Spanish embassy in Switzerland was occupied for 2 hours by protesters. President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría, called for Spanish membership of the United Nations Security Council to be suspended, but this was vetoed by the US, who considered it an internal Spanish matter. Pope Paul VI asked the Spanish government to grant clemency to <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, though he also condemned the crimes that <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> were convicted of. Franco's brother, Nicolás Franco, joined calls for clemency, appealing to Franco's Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Booth was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended the hanging of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> man's bravery in facing death stoically.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> men were not killed instantly.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{continued}} to battle typecasting, turning down well-paying villainous roles {{to develop more}} complex characters. His performance as police inspector Slimane in Walter Wanger's Algiers (1938) was recognized by the National Board of Review. Working with director John Farrow at RKO Pictures in 1939, he created a fine character study as <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> anarchist in Five Came Back, and portrayed a heroic priest in Full Confession. Calleia was announced to star as Father Damien in an RKO picture to be {{written and directed by}} Farrow, but the project was not realized.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> semi-Arians <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> Anomoeans in the Council of Seleucia, and <b>the</b> Anomoeans <b>condemned</b> <b>the</b> semi-Arians {{in their}} {{turn in the}} Councils of Constantinople and Antioch; erasing the word [...] from the formula of Rimini and that of Constantinople and protesting that the Word had not only a {{different}} substance but also a will {{different from that of}} the Father. From that, they were to be called [...]|$|R
5|$|During Romania's {{restrictive}} communist period, {{which lasted}} between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout {{the first part}} of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (see Censorship in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.|$|E
5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, {{the process by}} which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{affair was}} largely {{forgotten}} after Galileo's death, {{and the controversy}} subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> Dialogue) in Florence. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue. In 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism {{was removed from the}} Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.|$|E
5000|$|Fatah, {{the ruling}} {{faction of the}} Palestinian Authority, accused Israel of a war crime saying [...] "Fatah <b>condemns</b> <b>the</b> war crime carried out by Israeli {{occupation}} forces in Jerusalem against three Palestinian teens,". The Israeli government, in response, demanded that <b>the</b> Palestinian Authority <b>condemn</b> <b>the</b> attack saying [...] "The Prime Minister demands that <b>the</b> Palestinian Authority <b>condemn</b> <b>the</b> attack and expects {{the international community to}} do so too".|$|R

5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|The three FRAP {{members were}} buried the same morning in Hoyo de Manzanares. The {{executed}} men's families claimed they were {{denied access to}} their graves in the village graveyard and scuffles with police took place. However, Gustavo Catalán Deus, a photographer who witnessed the burials, said that some family members had been present, together with police, {{members of the military}} and lawyers. The families had previously alleged that police had assaulted the mother of one of <b>the</b> <b>condemned</b> in Carabanchel Prison in Madrid during her final meeting with her son. The remains of Sánchez Bravo were later reinterred in Murcia, with those of Ramón García Sanz being reinterred in Madrid. Juan Paredes, who had been buried in Barcelona, was reinterred in Zarautz on 12 January 1977.|$|E
