5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel <b>Their</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>Were</b> Watching God.|$|E

25|$|Zora Neale Hurston (January 7, 1891 – January 28, 1960) was an American novelist, {{short story}} writer, folklorist, and {{anthropologist}} {{known for her}} contributions to African-American literature, her portrayal of racial struggles in the American South, and works documenting her research on Haitian voodoo.

25|$|Struthiomimus had a {{build and}} {{skeletal}} structure typical of ornithomimids, differing from closely related genera like Ornithomimus and Gallimimus in proportions and anatomical details. As with other ornithomimids, they had small slender heads on long necks (which made up about 40% {{of the length}} of the body in front of the hips). <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> large and their jaws were toothless. Their vertebral columns consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, six hip vertebrae, and about thirty-five tail vertebrae. Their tails were relatively stiff and probably used for balance. They had long slender arms and hands, with immobile forearm bones and limited opposability between the first finger and the other two. As in other ornithomimids but unusually among theropods, the three fingers were roughly the same length, and the claws were only slightly curved; Henry Fairfield Osborn, describing a skeleton of S. altus in 1917, compared the arm to that of a sloth. These might have been adaptations to support wing feathers.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of day three, the spacecraft was about [...] away from the Earth. The velocity of the craft steadily decreased, as it had not yet reached the lunar sphere of gravitational influence. The early part of day three was largely housekeeping, spacecraft maintenance and exchanging status reports with Mission Control in Houston. The crew performed the Apollo light flash experiment, or ALFMED, to investigate [...] "light flashes" [...] that were seen by the astronauts when the spacecraft was dark, {{regardless of whether or}} not <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> open, on Apollo lunar flights. This was thought to be caused by the penetration of the eye by cosmic ray particles. During the second half of the day, Young and Duke again entered the Lunar Module to power it up and check its systems, and perform housekeeping tasks in preparation for lunar landing. The systems were found to be functioning as expected. Following this, the crew donned their space suits and rehearsed procedures that would be used on landing day. Just before the end of flight day three at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds after liftoff, while [...] from the Earth and [...] from the Moon, the spacecraft's velocity began increasing as it accelerated towards the Moon after entering the lunar sphere of influence.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} and demon designs were done by regular series artist Kazuma Kaneko. At the start, Kaneko {{was given the}} instruction to give the characters tribal uniforms instead of normal clothes, and an Atma tattoo somewhere on their body to signify their demon power. The uniforms signified their eternal conflict within the Junkyard. To help bring individuality to the main characters, Kaneko create slight variations in them, such as giving them hoods or capes. The grey tribal uniforms were created so the main characters' key colors would stand out. Serph, as the player {{character and}} silent protagonist, was given few personality traits and designed with a stern expression. The aspect that separated him from other silent protagonist within the Megami Tensei series was that his name was spoken by the other characters rather than chosen by the player. To emphasize {{the fact that the}} world of Digital Devil Saga was unlike the typical setting for Megami Tensei titles, he gave all the characters hair and eye colors that would be naturally impossible in the real world. [...] The only one not to have a strange hair color was Sera, signifying her unique status. The characters' demon forms were designed to be animal-like, signifying their urge to eat. They were given prominent mouths as demons, as the idea was that they would eat their foes when in demon form. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> removed as they stood out too much. Each character was designed around a specific elemental theme, which both flowed into the gameplay and matched an individual's personality: an example of this is Heat, who has an angry personality and uses Fire as his primary element.|$|E
500|$|The two secondhand vessels [...] {{were joined}} in January 1899 by the newly built Manchester City of 7,696 grt, {{constructed}} by Raylton Dixon & Co of Middlesbrough. This steamship carried [...] of coal, burned at [...] per day, giving {{a speed of}} , fast for her day. [...] She was a refrigerated vessel, designed to carry frozen meat and live cattle, and was claimed {{to be one of}} the largest meat-carrying ships then afloat. She made a successful maiden voyage from Canada and up the new canal to Manchester, taking two days and stopping overnight at Irlam to give the crew a rest. The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the canal pilots, on reaching Irlam, looked as if they had not been in bed for a week, as <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> bleared with exhaustion". The City discharged 450cattle and 150sheep at Manchester Corporation's Foreign Animals Wharf near the Mode Wheel locks in Salford. With an overall length of , she was by far the largest vessel to have ventured up the waterway, and her successful navigation disproved the claim of Liverpool owners that only ships of [...] or less could safely reach Manchester. The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|E

2500|$|Temnodontosaurus {{have the}} largest eyes of any ichthyosaur, and of any animal {{measured}}. The largest eyes measured were from the species T. platyodon. Despite the enormous size of their eyes, species of Temnodontosaurus had blind spots directly above their head due to the angle at which <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> pointed. [...] The eyes of Temnodontosaurus had sclerotic rings. According to Ryosuke Motani, the sclerotic rings of T. platyodon are at least 25 cm in diameter. It is assumed that Temnodontosaurus had high visual capacity. McGowan hypothesized that Ichthyosaurs have a sclerotic ring to give the eye rigidity. According to McGowan Ichthyosaurs, and so Temnodontosaurus, used vision as their main sense {{and it would have}} been unlikely that they could do echolocation to sense out prey.|$|E
