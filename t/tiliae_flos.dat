40|$|A new {{and rapid}} HPLC method for {{identification}} and determination of myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol and total flavonoids in ten herbal drugs of Macedonian origin is presented. Preparation of samples (Uvae ursi folim, Pruni spinosae flos, Sambuci flos, Betulae folim, Primulae flos, Herniariae herba, Centaurii herba, <b>Tiliae</b> <b>flos,</b> Robiniae pseudoacaciae flos, Bursae pastoris herba) included hydrolysis of glycosides and extraction of total aglycones with ethyl acetate. HPLC analysis with UV-diode array detection {{was carried out}} on RP C 18 column, using 5...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the chemical and microbiological composition of seven commercial samples of <b>Tiliae</b> <b>flos</b> cum bracteis. Sample S 2 presents the maximum level of microbiological contamination with 1. 2 x 104 colony forming units (CFU) aerobic germs/g, 9. 6 x 103 CFU fungi/g, and 360 CFU Salmonella sp. /g. For all samples the number of colony forming units {{for each type of}} microorganisms was under the limits of European Pharmacopoeia, 8 th edition. The amount of flavonoids ranges between 489 ± 1. 25 mg/ 100 g (S 2) and 647 ± 1. 32 mg/ 100 g (S 4). For polyphenols the quantities range between 663 ± 2. 12 mg/ 100 g (S 2) and 1, 169 ± 2. 76 mg/ 100 g (S 3). The maximum levels of metals determined in mineralised extracts were: 10. 35 ± 0. 22 mg Mn/ 100 g (S 5), 22. 66 ± 0. 23 mg Zn/ 100 g (S 3), 1. 36 ± 0. 12 mg Cu/ 100 g (S 4), 9. 92 ± 0. 12 mg Fe/ 100 g (S 2), and 9. 15 ± 0. 12 mg Pb/ 100 g (S 3) ...|$|E
