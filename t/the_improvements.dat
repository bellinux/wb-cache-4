5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session.

Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river.

5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that <b>the</b> <b>improvements</b> would cost £9,979.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>improvements,</b> the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at any given time.

The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
