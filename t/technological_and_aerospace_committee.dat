50|$|The Amy Johnson Named Lecture {{was inaugurated}} in 2011 by the Royal Aeronautical Society's Women in Aviation <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> <b>Committee</b> to {{celebrate}} a century of women in flight and to honour Britain's most famous woman aviator. The Lecture is held on or close to 6 July every year to mark the date in 1929 when Amy Johnson was awarded her pilot’s licence. The Lecture is intended to tackle serious issues of interest to a wide audience, not just women. High-profile women from industry are asked to lecture on a topic that speaks of future challenges of interest to everyone.|$|R
40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{public interest in}} and goodwill toward the space program. For NASA's plans for the next 25 years to be achieved, this public reservoir of support needs to be tapped and channeled. NASA endeavors have to reach out beyond the scientific, <b>technological,</b> <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> communities to foster wider participation in space exploration and exploitation. To broaden NASA support and spread out the financing of space activities, recommendations for consideration are offered {{in the area of}} economics, political, institutional, international, and managerial areas...|$|R

30|$|The IEG {{course is}} the {{introductory}} course in the required design sequence for mechanical engineering majors <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> engineering majors. The class is taken primarily by first-year students. In some cases, transfer students <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> engineering students take the course later in their undergraduate tenure. Students in the course are mostly mechanical engineering <b>and</b> <b>aerospace</b> engineering majors; some students majoring in industrial design or materials science and engineering take the course as an elective. The main skill sets covered in the course are engineering visualization, sketching, and CAD.|$|R
40|$|Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> {{are major}} {{elements}} in the global economy. In the UK, they contribute significantly to wealth creation and quality of life, both directly {{and in terms of}} technology spin-off to other sectors. Aerospace alone contributes a £ 2 - 3 B surplus to the UK's trade balance. The UK is a leader in design and manufacture of advanced systems, deriving from programmes of R&D supported by industry and Government. In both Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace,</b> the UK's market opportunities are enhanced by the operating competitiveness of UK companies which has improved radically over the past 15 years. The role of Government is more important in Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> than in any other industrial sector. In Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace,</b> governments are market forces and, in terms of UK technology, the Defence Research Agency is a key national resource. The Future Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> are important markets for the future. The global market for Civil Aerospace is likely to grow significantly over the next 10 - 20 years. The UK is well placed to exploit this growth, through its involvement in the Airbus project, because of strong market positions in aeroengines and the equipment sector, and in market niches such as aerostructures and civil helicopters. Defence markets, although declining {{since the end of the}} Cold War, remain very substantial and offer many opportunities to exploit new technologies. New technologies are changing the nature of warfare, and new demands on defence forces require new technological solutions. The sectoral issue for the UK is whether it wishes to continue as a leader. The UK is in competition with other economies, notably the US, France and Germany, to host a significant share of the world Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> industry. To continue as a leader the UK must set strategic goals similar to those adopted by our competitors who are making vigorous efforts to sustain their product and technology bases. We cannot continue `consuming our <b>technological</b> inheritance '- <b>and</b> must begin now to regenerate our product range by adequately funded, well-focused investments in new technology. The Panel's Vision, towards which its recommendations are geared, is: Industry, Government and Academia working in partnership so that UK Defence <b>and</b> <b>Aerospace</b> continues as a major contributor to wealth and national security...|$|R
