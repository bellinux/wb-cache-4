5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and not given to self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old.</b> At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E

25|$|Though vangas were {{traditionally}} {{believed to}} be a small family of generally shrike-like birds, recent research suggests that several Madagascan taxa most similar in appearance and habits (and formerly considered <b>to</b> <b>be)</b> <b>Old</b> World warblers, Old World flycatchers or Old World babblers may be vangas. Yamagishi et al. found in 2001 that Newtonia appeared to belong with the vangas rather than the warblers and also that Tylas was a vanga and not a bulbul. It also appears that Ward's flycatcher and Crossley's babbler belong with the vangas.|$|E
25|$|The name Wycombe {{appears to}} come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, combe, but {{according}} to the Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names the name, which was first recorded in 799-802 as 'Wichama', is more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Old</b> English 'wic' and the plural of Old English 'ham', and probably means 'dwellings'; the name of the river was a late back-formation. Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.|$|E

500|$|Simonsohn urged {{researchers}} to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An {{example of a}} confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters [...] "Den" [...] compared to with [...] "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old,</b> {{and more likely to}} be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more [...] "Den" [...] dentists than [...] "Wal" [...] than implicit egotism.Using both a different data set (TwitterandGoogle+accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, well over 4,000 hop-pickers and some 23,000 {{visitors}} travelled in 56 [...] "Hopper specials"– extra services laid {{on during the}} late August – early October hop season; at the busiest period, up to six trains per day ran through to the branch from London. In 1912 there had been 26 specials each carrying as many as 350 people; they generally started at [...] and called at [...] or [...] The farmers agreed between themselves when the picking would begin, and informed the railway who then set about the planning of the special trains. A [...] "Hop Control Centre" [...] was set up at Paddock Wood to organise these services, ensuring that hoppers could alight at London Bridge and be taken directly to the nearest hop farm. Since the hopping season generally coincided {{with the end of}} the holiday season, most serviceable trains were already in use elsewhere, so spare rolling stock would be brought out of storage and pressed into service for just three weeks; sometimes carriages had to be borrowed from other parts of the country. The carriages tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old</b> or in poor condition, since the hoppers had a reputation for drunkenness and violence. This traffic was however already in decline as rising living standards and paid holidays led to a decline in the hop-picker workforce, and many of those who remained chose to travel by car or van. By 1959 the Sunday service consisted of a single two-coach unit, with an evening working to London Bridge. As mechanical pickers gradually replaced the human workforce, hop-picking had become a memory by the time the branch closed in 1961.|$|E

2500|$|The American author Michael Lewis has criticised the magazine's {{editorial}} anonymity, labeling it a {{means to}} hide the youth and inexperience of those writing articles. In 1991 Lewis quipped: [...] "The magazine is written by young people pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>old</b> people ...
