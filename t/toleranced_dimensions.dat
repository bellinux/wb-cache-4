40|$|Tolerances are {{assigned}} to a mechanical engineering design either {{on the basis of}} functional and/or manufacturing requirements (<b>toleranced</b> <b>dimensions,</b> geometrical tolerances) or {{on the basis of the}} general categories-fine, medium, coarse-of the international standards or the designer's knowledge and experience (untoleranced dimensions). Conventional dimensions of the currently applicable dimensioning rules and implicit dimensions, including those attributed to geometrical tolerances, thus create four groups of tolerances which may or may not be compatible. In addition, any tolerance compromise, however tedious and difficult, not achieved systematically may well lead to accuracies which cannot be produced by the available machine tools. In the paper, a systematic approach to the above problems is presented. A methodology is demonstrated for the verification of the tolerance compatibility and for the assignment of compatible, producible and cost optimum tolerances. © 1993 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{assembly}} sequencing is {{to plan a}} feasible series of operations to construct a product from its individual parts. Previous research has investigated assembly sequencing {{under the assumption that}} parts have nominal geometry. This paper considers the case where parts have toleranced geometry. Its main contribution is an efficient procedure that decides if a product admits an assembly sequence with infinite translations (i. e., translations that can be extended arbitrarily far along a fixed direction) that is feasible for all possible instances of the components within the specified tolerances. If the product admits one such sequence, the procedure can also generate it.

These two procedures are described for two-dimensional assemblies made of polygonal parts and for three-dimensional assemblies made of polyhedral parts. So far, only the rst has been implemented (for the planar case). This work assumes a simple, but non-trivial tolerance language that falls short of capturing all imperfections of a manufacturing process. In particular, it assumes that faces and edges have perfect relative orientations. Thus, it is only one step toward dealing with tolerances in assembly sequencing...|$|E

We found strong positive effects of education on a multi-ple target group tolerance scale that included both left-wing and right-wing groups. A substantial fraction of the education effect on tolerance is mediated by cognitive sophistication. The effects of education on tolerance are strong even when a person has negative feelings toward the target group. This paper helps iden-tify why and when (e. g., cognitive sophistication and dislike of a target group) education enhances political tolerance. We discuss the implications of the research for debates on the education-tolerance relationship...|$|R

40|$|Tolerances {{contribute}} both to {{the accuracy}} and quality of a mechanical product and to the manufacturing cost of the product. Tolerance optimisation {{taking into account the}} relevant machining cost is effected by making use of various empirical and/or analytical and computer-aided techniques and methodologies, with varying degrees of success.

On the basis of the available industrial knowledge and the published work, the paper presents {{the development of a new}} analytical cost-tolerance model.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{automatic}} three-dimensional (3 D) functional tolerancing. A combination between the Minimum Transfer Modified Method (MT- 2 M) and qualitative tolerancing method for prismatic parts is developed. The MT- 2 M {{is used for}} the recognition of functional surfaces. This technique lies in integrating the projections of surfaces of the parts under consideration along the three axes (X, Y and Z) and the contacts between these same surfaces in one table of matrix representation of the assembly. Then, the adequate qualitative tolerancing of the part under study is determined according to the number of functional conditions (CF), their types, and by using an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) analysis. Finally, a 3 D functional <b>tolerancing</b> (<b>dimensioning</b> and <b>tolerancing)</b> is then obtained in localization and orientation, to be installed on the drawings of different parts of the assembly.

This study discusses a study done in Malaysia on community social capital. Specifically, {{the purpose is to}} identify the between social capital dimensions and three demographic factors: age, monthly income, number of households and the relationship within the dimensions itself. Six social capital dimensions were identified namely participation in community activities, pro activity in the social context, neighborhood connections, multi-racial tolerance, a sense of trust and protection and life values. Based on a focus group discussion and past studies, 36 items were developed to measure the six dimensions of social capital. A total of 293 respondents were selected based on simple random sampling in six different districts in Malaysia. Result found that age only correlated significantly with the multi-racial <b>tolerance</b> <b>dimension.</b> Monthly income and the number of households did not have any significant relationship with any social capital dimensions.
