40|$|A large {{theoretical}} {{literature suggests}} that …nancial frictions provide a mechanism which ampli…es and propagates macroeconomic shocks. However, quantitative papers that embed this mechanism, {{referred to as the}} credit multiplier, into standard DSGE models conclude that although credit constraints delay the velocity at which productivity shocks propagate into the economy, they have no signi…cant ampli…cation e¤ects, with the exception of special cases. Motivated by these results, in this paper we re-examine the quantitative role of …nancial frictions in business cycles to address the following question: is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the credit multiplier? Our answer is no. In coming to this answer, we work with a model with reproducible capital and collateral constraints within two setups, a general and a partial equilibrium. Our results from the …rst model in terms of propagation and ampli…cation do not di¤er from previous papers. However, our main …nding {{is that it is not}} the credit multiplier what fails in this type of models, but rather their ability to produce su ¢ cient variability in prices. In particular, in a model with reproducible capital, general equilibrium dynamics counteract the logic of price ‡uctuations described by theoretical models, thus preventing the credit multiplier from being triggered. The partial equilibrium setup allows us to con…rm our previous claim: absent the general equilibrium e¤ects, the credit multiplier is indeed an e¤ective amplifying mechanism of shocks into the economy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into the current meaning of disability and of some forms of contemporary disability discourse. The chief provider of data for the study is the Norwegian Federation of Organizations of Disabled People (FFO), a non-governmental organization that acts as a sociopolitical umbrella for its primarily medico-diagnostic member organizations. The research questions originate in tensions that are inherent in FFO s structure and role: How do medical, social, and political discourses shape the current meaning of disability? How is the meaning of disability produced in and by texts? The thesis s four research articles provide four different points of entry for exploring these questions. Article I, "Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification: Disability policy documents from a Norwegian NGO", is a close reading of FFO s programmatic documents, its bylaws and a selection of consultative statements. Article II, "Is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> society, or is it just me? Social and medical knowledge in a Norwegian anti-discrimination law", deals with a 2009 piece of legislation which integrates the anti-discrimination perspective with traditional welfare state mechanisms. Article III, "False Dichotomies of Disability Politics: Theory and Practice in the Discourse of Norwegian NGO Professionals, explores the relationship between disability theory as perceived in academe and in the FFO system. Article IV, "Disability and discourse analysis: Some topics and issues", surveys disability studies literature and critically examines some of the major disputes between different theories and models of disability. In sum, the interaction between and the interdependence of the social and medical models suggest that the prevailing notion of a conflict between the two is inaccurate. A more nuanced understanding of both models will be both more accurate and more useful in furthering descriptive precision of disability as a social phenomenon and better communication between language users in the disability field...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the problems with a social norm that assumes women should shoulder a disproportionate amount of unpaid family work. It evaluates the most recent empirical data which suggests that women continue to do substantially more unpaid work than men, and men continue to do substantially more paid work than women. It then briefly reviews two standard explanations for where this gendered division of work may come from, biological inclination and/or systems of male dominance. It suggests that neither of these traditional explanations have given adequate consideration to the normative question begged by the extant division of labor. Is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> {{the fact that women}} seem to choose to do more unpaid work than men do? This article answers that question both for women who forego paid work entirely and for (the much larger class of) women who combine paid and unpaid work but still perform the lion’s share of their household’s home work. The article suggests that the problem with the unpaid work norm is not so much that women do not get paid for as much of their work as men do, because many women do end up getting paid – by their husbands – for the work they do in the home. Instead, the problem with the unpaid work norm is the messages that it sends with regard to the need for and ability to combine paid and unpaid work. The analysis presented suggests that women opting out of paid work entirely is problematic because it puts insufficient pressure on the workplace to afford flexibility for the many workers who need it. More important, the article suggests that the extant division of unpaid labor, even in households in which both spouses perform paid work, is putting many of the equality gains that women have made in jeopardy. If so many women continue to subordinate their own paid work so that their spouses do not have to, the workplace is likely to take notice and start assuming precisely that. Employers may well start resisting equality legislation that prevents firms from making accurate predications about women’s likelihood of working less hard (at paid work) than do men...|$|E
40|$|Imagine a {{beautiful}} fall {{day on a}} Southern college campus. The leaves are changing, {{and the sound of}} the band practicing for this weekend’s big game echoes throughout campus. Jane, a college freshman, is walking through campus on the way back to her dorm from her Biology 101 class. Usually, Jane’s walk is uneventful, aside from the occasional run-in with a friend or sorority sister; however, today is much different. Jane notices that many people are staring, pointing, and snickering at her. Is there something on her face? She quickly pulls out her compact and realizes that all makeup is intact. Is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> her clothes? She briskly looks herself over and nothing is out of place. Paranoid, Jane starts to walk back to her dorm a little faster, but people are still staring. All of a sudden, someone in the crowd yells, “Hey Jane, nice picture on collegegossip. com!” Confused, Jane tries to imagine what this guy is talking about. What picture? Her memory is faded from the events of last weekend due to her drinking too much at a keg party. But her friends would not have let anyone take picture of her passed out, right? Finally arriving at her dorm, Jane hurries onto the computer and goes to the website. There, Jane is horrified to view an anonymously posted picture of her passed out naked on a stranger’s bed. Under the picture is a string of comments claiming that Jane is a “whore, who gave me syphilis. ” Desperate, Jane contacts the operators of the website and begs them to remove the picture and the comments. Jane also informs the operators that she has never contracted a sexually transmitted disease and that, if they did not remove the material, she would sue for defamation. Days later, the operators respond to Jane, and tell her that they are protected by federal law and are not required to remove the statements. The operators also inform Jane that the anonymous posters have a First Amendment right to tell it how it is. Unfortunately, this nightmare is all too real. Anonymous gossip websites, blogs, social networking websites, online bulletin boards, and other similar types of Internet forums allow people to speak their minds and exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and expression; however, these online forums can be abused when people use the sites to defame others. When a defamatory statement is posted on the Internet, it is often times difficult to locate the individual responsible because most of the defamers are given anonymity by their Internet service provider (“ISP”). Plaintiffs in Internet defamation suits are unable to easily name their defamers since usually only the defamer’s screen name is available. Furthermore, most courts interpret the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“CDA”) to give ISPs complete immunity from liability for the defamatory posts of third parties, even if notified that certain statements are defamatory. Thus, ISPs have no civil liability to remove defamatory material, and the defamed plaintiffs are left with little recourse. This judicial interpretation of the CDA is significantly different from the well-established common law of defamation, as well as the very purpose for the enactment of the CDA. Internet defamation is an increasing problem, leaving the defamed helpless and the defamers believing they have a First Amendment right to post defamatory content. This Article will reemphasize the notion that the First Amendment does not protect defamatory speech on the Internet. Part I of this Article will discuss defamation law as part of common law, as applied to the Internet before the passage of the CDA, while Part II will discuss the judicial interpretation of the CDA in defamation cases. Part III of this Article will address the problems with the CDA as currently interpreted by the judicial system. Finally, Part IV will propose amendments to the CDA, which are intended to clarify the statute in order to give more legal options to defamed victims. Furthermore, Part IV will explain how the proposed amendments would not violate the First Amendment...|$|E

40|$|Hidden and {{unhidden}} normativity in Social {{science education}} and History education are being intensively researched and criticized in both educational scientific and media discourses (Gatto 2002). In addition, they are extensively discussed {{in teacher education}} and concealed or explicated in education policies and curricula for these school subjects. These discussions are further, to more or less extent, related to civic and citizenship education, {{as well as to}} political discourses more generally (e. g. Papastephanou, 2007; Hedtke, Zimenkova & Hippe, 2008 in previous issues of JSSE). Not only do political actors at macro level try to provide for citizen formation with help of Social science education and History education. A multitude of other actors at regional and local level – be it non- governmental, religious or economic actors, or parents – bring their own agendas and normative stances into the school subjects of Social science education and History Education. The term “hidden curricula” and the idea of (hidden) normativity are further associated with national and supra national policy agendas and grand cultural narratives. However, local and regional specifics that are intimately connected to the normatively laden conceptions of citizenship edu- cation and learning inside and outside of school, we argue, can and should be provided increased attention in research. In this special issue, two school subjects are highlighted: Social science education and History education. The very idea of normativity of Social science education and History education is being evaluated quite differently in different national educational settings and subject didactic traditions. It encom- passes the whole range from being considered as allowable and wishful in order to reach some central moral, political or other normative goals of society to absolute ban and resolute absence of any substantive or normative qualification of social science and history teachers as professionals (for the German discussion, cf. Besand et al., 2011). This special issue of the JSSE, entitled (Hidden) Normativity in Social Science Education and History Education brings together empirical, methodological and theoretical contributions that in {{one way or the other}} elaborate on normativity in Social science edu- cation and History education. Central questions addressed in the call are: How is normativity visible and formed within Social science education and History education? How can these processes be approached empirically? Is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> normativity, and if so why? Which role does normativity play for social science teachers and history teachers in their profession? The authors in this issue have created vital responses to these questions, suggesting new comparative methodologies and opening up innovative areas of empirical research in more or less theoretical framings. The following specific approaches to research on normativity in Social science education and History education are embraced by the authors: - Normativity is stressed as a phenomenon indisputably related to Social science education and History education. But the modes of normativity, its explicitness, direction, strength and actors alter. Education policy and practice are deeply entwined, and processes of normative change come to the fore [...] in critical and constructive investigations of central concepts in these school subjects, at different school levels and over time. Out of different theoretical and methodological approaches, the authors demon- strate convincingly the necessity to consider differ- rent sources of empirical material in order not only to map and describe different facets of normativity in Social science education and History education. But also to make a case for the complexity involved in the intermingling of hidden and unhidden normativity in the everyday practice of teaching and learning of these school subjects. - Focusing different forms of knowledge and conceptual uses in policy and practice in Social science education and History education (at mainly upper secondary level) allow for approaching normativity not only as a matter of detecting where it is situated in these school subjects and why this is so. It also contributes to the development of relevant subject specific methodological frameworks that may be considered key for the development of this field of research. - Sociological and other educational theories and methods deriving from social sciences are being use innovatively by the authors. In doing so, we argue, they open up for a widening of the scope as regards the meaning and importance of theoretically underpinned comparative approaches to the research field of subject didactics. - By stressing critical concepts and conceptual uses in Social science education and History edu- cation, the intimate connection between these subjects and their assigned task to see to citizenship learning and social formation emerges.   Editorial presentation and problematisation of the concept of Normativity in Social Science Education and History Education</p...|$|E
