40|$|When {{there is}} {{information}} overload on the visual modality, another system of warnings must be adopted to prevent potential risks—tactile warning systems present a viable alternative. Building on work on design approaches for auditory warning systems that match appropriate warnings to {{the severity of}} risk, this thesis presents an approach to design <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> based on perceived urgency. To do this, I use a subjective rating technique. I performed three experiments to demonstrate this approach. Our research approach uses subjective rating technique to evaluate perceived urgency. Three experiments were conducted to design <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> with a tactile interface developed by attaching a grid of tactors on a vest. In Experiment 1 and 2, I evaluated perceived urgency of several warning designs with three important parameters of <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> with subjective rating. In Experiment 3 I examined one warning design {{in the context of}} flight simulation. The results of Experiment 1 and 2 showed that participants can discriminate between all levels of perceived urgency from most warning parameters. In Experiment 3, the results showed that selected warning design was correctly mapped with the severity of most events. The findings suggest that <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> based on perceived urgency can be a possible approach, but further studies will be required to evaluate different parameters of <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{a driving}} {{simulator}} experiment, effects were tested {{of an integrated}} support system on driving behaviour, user acceptance and workload. An alternative workload measure was used based upon peripheral vision. Two modes of support (tactile and speech messages) were compared to a control condition without support. Subjects were confronted with critical incidents dealing with lateral and longitudinal control on rural roads and motorways. The experiment showed that speech warnings are better suited for things related to law-enforcement, while <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> {{are more suitable for}} situations directly related to driver safety. Although <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> do result in compliance in enforcement type of situations, compliance is less than with speech warnings. For safety-related situations that do not require an immediate response, such as when approaching a sharp curve while speed is too high, speech warnings have the same effects as <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings.</b> However, if the criticality of the situation increases fast, for example when a lead vehicle brakes unexpectedly, <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> result in more favourable effects than speech warnings. Still, both speech and <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> do have a favourabie effect of driver safety in a general way.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two experiments evaluating a set {{of speech}} and tactile driver warnings. Six speech messages of three urgency levels were designed, along with their tactile equivalents, Speech Tactons. These new <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> retained the rhythm of speech and used different levels of roughness and intensity to convey urgency. The perceived urgency, annoyance and alerting effectiveness of these warnings were evaluated. Results showed that bimodal (audio and <b>tactile)</b> <b>warnings</b> were rated as more urgent, more annoying and more effective compared to unimodal ones (audio or tactile). Perceived urgency and alerting effectiveness decreased along with the designed urgency, while perceived annoyance was lowest for warnings of medium designed urgency. In the tactile modality, ratings varied less {{as compared to the}} audio and audiotactile modalities. Roughness decreased and intensity increased ratings for Speech Tactons in all the measures used.

40|$|Multimodal {{displays}} {{are increasingly}} being utilized as driver warnings. Abstract warnings, without any semantic association to the signified event, and language-based warnings are examples of such displays. This paper presents a first comparison between these two types, across all combinations of audio, visual and tactile modalities. Speech, text and Speech Tactons (a novel form of <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> synchronous to speech) were compared to abstract pulses in two experiments. Results showed that recognition times of warning urgency during a non-critical driving situation were shorter for abstract warnings, highly urgent warnings and warnings including visual feedback. Response times during a critical situation were shorter for warnings including audio. We therefore suggest abstract visual feedback when informing drivers during a non-critical situation and audio in a highly critical one. Language-based warnings during a critical situation performed equally well as abstract ones, so they are suggested as less annoying vehicle alerts...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen growing {{interest}} {{in the design of}} tactile warning signals to direct driver attention to potentially dangerous road situations (e. g. an impending crash) so that they can initiate an avoidance maneuver in a timely manner. In this review, we highlight the potential uses of such warning signals for future collision warning systems and compare them with more traditional visual and auditory warnings. Basic tactile warning signals are capable of promoting driver alertness, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial for forward collision avoidance (when compared to a no warning baseline condition). However, beyond their basic alerting function, directional tactile warning signals are now increasingly being utilized to shift the attention of the driver toward locations of interest, and thus to further facilitate their speeded responses to potential collision events. Currently, many researchers are focusing their efforts on the development of meaningful (iconic) tactile warning signals. For instance, dynamic <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> (varying in their intensity and/or location) can potentially be used to convey meaningful information to drivers. Finally, we highlight the future research that will be needed in order to explore how to present multiple directional warnings using dynamic tactile cues, thus forming an integrated collision avoidance system for future in-vehicle use...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} Audio, Visual and <b>Tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> for drivers, highlighting {{the importance of}} conveying the appropriate level of urgency through the signals. However, these modalities have never been combined exhaustively with different urgency levels and tested while using a driving simulator. This paper describes two experiments investigating all multimodal combinations of such warnings along three different levels of designed urgency. The warnings were first evaluated in terms of perceived urgency and perceived annoyance {{in the context of}} a driving simulator. The results showed that the perceived urgency matched the designed urgency of the warnings. More urgent warnings were also rated as more annoying but the effect of annoyance was lower compared to urgency. The warnings were then tested for recognition time when presented during a simulated driving task. It was found that warnings of high urgency induced quicker and more accurate responses than warnings of medium and of low urgency. In both studies, the number of modalities used in warnings (one, two or three) affected both subjective and objective responses. More modalities led to higher ratings of urgency and annoyance, with annoyance having a lower effect compared to urgency. More modalities also led to quicker responses. These results provide implications for multimodal warning design and reveal how modalities and modality combinations can influence participant responses during a simulated driving task...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This study {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility of pedestrian collision warnings presented via different sensory modalities in a driving simulator. Despite the well-established fact that reaction times (RT) are faster under S-R compatible conditions, the majority of collision warning research has used S-R incompatible warnings (i. e., the warning comes {{from the direction of the}} obstacle to be avoided not the desired response direction). Thirty-two participants in a fixed-base driving simulator drove on a three-lane urban road in which pedestrians randomly walked from the sidewalk into the roadway. Collision warnings in two different modalities (tactile and auditory) were compared with a no warning condition. Participants were equally divided into one of four conditions representing all combinations of two levels of warning S-R compatibility (compatible and incompatible) and two levels of warning timing (early and late). For early warnings, incompatible warnings were most effective as shown by a significantly shorter steering RT and larger clearance distance. For late warnings, compatible warnings were most effective. For early warnings, RTs were significantly faster in the tactile condition. The relationship between collision warning effectiveness and S-R compatibility in driving is dependent on whether the driver has time to evaluate the situation before collision will occur. Our findings have important implications for the design of effective tactile and auditory collision warning systems. However, further research is needed to determine if these effects occur in more representative driving conditions (e. g., lower pedestrian incursion rate and unreliable warnings).

40|$|Driver {{fatigue and}} {{drowsiness}} {{can have a}} profound impact on safety. Centerline and shoulder rumble strips (RS) are popular countermeasures designed to produce audible and tactile warning when vehicles deviate from the travel lane onto the RS. This reduces the risk of lane departure crashes. Studies show that the noise produced by RS is a function of many variables. RS depth is known to have the greatest impact on alerting drivers. However, chip-seal pavement maintenance operations have the tendency to reduce the original RS design depth, which may {{have an impact on the}} functional effectiveness of the RS. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a controlled experiment to understand the relationship between milled RS depth and noise and vibration in the vehicle cab. In-vehicle noise and vibration levels were collected on five different RS depths (i. e., 1 / 82 ̆ 2, 1 / 42 ̆ 2, 3 / 82 ̆ 2, 1 / 22 ̆ 2 and 5 / 82 ̆ 2), on three RS types (i. e., shoulder, single centerline, and double centerline), on three highways in the state of Nebraska, and using two vehicles travelling at speeds of 45 mph, 55 mph, and 65 mph. RS depths at 1 / 82 ̆ 2 intervals were used to simulate the influence of a chip-seal on the RS effectiveness. On the basis of the in-vehicle sound and vibration levels of all the tested RS depths, it was shown in this research that a 1 / 82 ̆ 2 reduction in the current milled RS design depth, as a result of chip-sealing, does not result in a practical reduction in the RS effectiveness at producing audible and <b>tactile</b> <b>warnings</b> to alert drivers. Re-milling of rumble strips after chip sealing is therefore not recommended if the chip seal reduced the rumble strip depth by 1 / 82 ̆ 2...|$|E
40|$|Research has {{revealed}} that when drivers are presented with an informative <b>tactile</b> collision <b>warning,</b> {{they are able to}} produce faster braking reaction times (BRTs) which may potentially reduce the likelihood and severity of rear-end collisions. To expand on this research, we investigated the effectiveness of unimodal (tactile) and multisensory (audiotactile) informative collision warnings for younger and older drivers. In line with our previous results, driver BRTs were significantly faster when they were presented with an informative signal as compared to a non-informative signal and a control condition in which no warnings were presented. The results also revealed that the unimodal informative warning was just as effective as the multisensory warning. Intriguingly, older drivers exhibited faster BRTs than younger drivers, and were significantly faster following the presentation of multisensory warning signals. Finally, this study identifies the need to compare new configurations of informative <b>tactile</b> collision <b>warning</b> signals...|$|R

In the experiments reported here, participants' visual attention was manipulated such that they were either attending to the frontal object that might occasionally approach them on a collision course, or else they were distracted by a color discrimination task presented from behind. We measured how rapidly participants were able to initiate a braking response to a looming visual target following the onset of vibrotactile warning signals presented from around their waist. The vibrotactile warning signals consisted of single, double, and triple upward moving cues (Experiment 1), triple upward and downward moving cues (Experiment 2), and triple random cues (Experiment 3).
