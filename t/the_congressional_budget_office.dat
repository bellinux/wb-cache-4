5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Office</b> said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Office</b> the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|Another {{chance for}} the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20's fast {{scramble}} time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. Additionally, the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas, {{they would be able}} to replace their aircraft more quickly. However, the Air Force's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower unit costs, maintain commonality between the ANG and USAF, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. <b>The</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Office</b> had also disputed Northrop's lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7. As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton is only the second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Office</b> reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was spent {{by the end of}} November 2009. Obama and <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Budget</b> <b>Office</b> predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E
