25|$|Netherne Hospital, Coulsdon, Surrey: in 1942 Eric Cunningham Dax, medical {{superintendent}} of Netherne Hospital, called in surgeon Eric Radley Smith {{to operate on}} patients. Before the year was out, fifty patients had undergone surgery, and in April 1943 the results {{were published in the}} Journal of Mental Science. Cunningham Dax described how he selected patients:"The operation was carried out with the primary object of relieving the most disturbed patients in the hospital quite independently of their poor prognosis. They formed {{a large proportion of the}} most violent, hostile, noisy, excited, destructive or obscene cases in the hospital; <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>who</b> distress their relatives, upset the other patients and consume the time and energy which could be put to so much better purpose by the staff".Two died of cerebral haemorrhage, two were discharged (of whom one relapsed); of those remaining in hospital two-thirds had shown at least some improvement, needing less staff time and supervision.|$|E

500|$|RZA sent several beats to West, {{including}} some that he cited as being edgy, {{because he felt}} that West was <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>who</b> could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding [...] "So Appalled". The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay-Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself, stating {{that it would make}} a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he [...] "tricked" [...] West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone. [...] When West awoke and played back the tape, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay-Z references on the line [...] "I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>who</b> accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E

60|$|First a word {{as to the}} Italian soldier. He is a type {{by himself}} which differs from the earnest {{solidarity}} of the new French army, and from the businesslike alertness of the Briton, and yet has a very special dash and fire of its own, covered over by a very pleasing and unassuming manner. London has not yet forgotten Durando of Marathon fame. He was just such another easy smiling youth as I now see everywhere around me. Yet there came a day when a hundred thousand Londoners hung upon his every movement--when strong men gasped and women wept at his invincible but unavailing spirit. When he had fallen senseless in that historic race on the very threshold of his goal, so high was the determination within him, that while he floundered on the track like a broken-backed horse, with the senses gone out of him, his legs still continued to drum upon the cinder path. Then when by pure will power he staggered {{to his feet and}} drove his dazed body across the line, it was an exhibition of pluck which put the little sunburned baker straightway among London's heroes. Durando's spirit is alive to-day, I see thousands of him all around me. A thousand such, led by a few young gentlemen of <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>who</b> occasionally give us object lessons in how to ride at Olympia, make no mean battalion. It has been a war of most desperate ventures, but never once has there been a lack of volunteers. The Tyrolese are good men--too good to be fighting in so rotten a cause. But from first to last the Alpini have had the ascendency in the hill fighting, as the line regiments have against the Kaiserlics upon the plain. Caesar told how the big Germans used to laugh at his little men until they had been at handgrips with them. The Austrians could tell the same tale. The spirit in the ranks is something marvellous. There have been occasions when every officer has fallen and yet the men have pushed on, have taken a position and then waited for official directions.|$|E
