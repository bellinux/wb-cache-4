5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} murder of <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end}} of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than half the people sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
40|$|Slowly {{digestible}} starch (SDS) {{was prepared}} from rice starches physically modified by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), maltosyl-β-CD, and hydroxypropyl-β-CD. Its thermal stability and crystalline properties were further explored, since such properties were important for SDS during heat processing. The {{results showed that}} the maximum percentage of remaining SDS was 78. 2 % for <b>the</b> starch <b>physically</b> modified by β-CD and subjected to dry heating for 15 min, and 73. 7 % for the starch subjected to moisture heating for 15 min. <b>The</b> starches <b>physically</b> modified by β-CD exhibited a higher peak melting temperature, conclusion temperature, and enthalpy change of melting than the control sample. The crystalline data indicated that the higher yield of SDS in <b>the</b> starch <b>physically</b> modified by β-CD could be attributed to a greater difference of partial V-type crystallites. More perfect crystallites and imperfect crystallites were formed, and designated as the major components of the SDS product. These findings suggest that <b>the</b> starch <b>physically</b> modified by β-CD had higher thermal stability because of the formation of VII-type crystallites, and was suitable for potential application during heat processing...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} {{consider}} {{the different approaches}} {{that can be used}} to examine the relationship between physical activity and aging. They propose that much is to be gained in our awareness of this dynamic relationship by drawing on multiple forms of knowledge that can generate diverse understandings regarding the impact of physical activity on physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Accordingly, 3 different approaches to understanding <b>the</b> older <b>physically</b> (in) active body are presented. These are categorized as (a) the objective truth about <b>the</b> aging, <b>physically</b> active body; (b) the subjective truth about <b>the</b> aging, <b>physically</b> active body; and (c) "tales" about <b>the</b> aging, <b>physically</b> active body. <b>The</b> key underpinnings, strengths, and weaknesses of each approach are outlined. A number of examples from the literature are also offered to demonstrate where and how each approach has been used to contribute to our understanding about older people and physical activity. The more thorough, multidisciplinary, and wide spanning our knowledge of the aging, active body is, the more informed we might become in every dimension of its existence...|$|R

In January 2000, her album, Homeland, {{produced}} by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary , which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, however, McCarthy leaves Homer {{for another}} client. Without McCarthy {{to keep him}} in shape, Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back. Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer, and the movie begins to go over budget. The studio {{executives}} and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful. The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> fit Homer merged, upsetting and confusing the audience. After the premiere of the film, McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again, which Homer accepts. The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel, on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to the fans and say he liked the film. Though pleased by the offer, Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online, and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again.|$|E
5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually <b>the</b> <b>physically</b> dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
