The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'.

Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions.</b> The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, as {{new forms}} of textual {{criticism}} and archaeological methods were developed, allowing for greater accuracy in understanding the past, various historians and archaeologists published {{books on the subject}} of the druids and came to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions.</b> The archaeologist Stuart Piggott, author of The Druids (1968), accepted the Greco-Roman accounts and considered the druids to be a barbaric and savage priesthood who performed human sacrifices. This view was largely supported by another archaeologist, Anne Ross, author of Pagan Celtic Britain (1967) and The Life and Death of a Druid Prince (1989), although she believed that they were essentially tribal priests, having more in common with the shamans of tribal societies than with the classical philosophers. Ross' views were largely accepted by two other prominent archaeologists to write on the subject, Miranda Aldhouse-Green—author of The Gods of the Celts (1986), Exploring the World of the Druids (1997) and Caesar's Druids: Story of an Ancient Priesthood (2010)—and Barry Cunliffe, author of Iron Age Communities in Britain (1991) and The Ancient Celts (1997).|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{have written}} that Starship Troopers is not driven by its plot, though it {{contains}} scenes of military combat. Instead, {{much of the}} novel is given over to a discussion of ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an [...] "ideologically intense" [...] book. A 1997 review in Salon categorized it as a [...] "philosophical novel". Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. While some have stated that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows the reader to draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions,</b> others have argued that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose was to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Life at the Bottom has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Gregory Schneider of the Topeka Capital-Journal called the collection [...] "the best {{exploration of the}} problems of poverty ever written." [...] America magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a [...] "barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal [...] "snorting indignation" [...] into the text without letting the reader draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions.</b> He ended by saying, [...] "Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it." [...] John Clark of Liberty magazine called it [...] "so compelling...that I read it cover to cover in a day's time—and later reread it twice." ...|$|E
500|$|But Locke does {{recommend}} several minor [...] "restrictions" [...] {{relating to}} the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: [...] "But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them must have some restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing." [...] Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions</b> regarding the [...] "different treatments" [...] required for girls and boys, if any. Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book The Whole Duty of a Woman (1696), the female companion to The Whole Duty of Man (1657), and Rousseau's [...] (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's Some Thoughts appears far more egalitarian.|$|E
50|$|There {{are both}} Greek and Latin {{versions}} of the fable. Babrius tells it unadorned and leaves hearers to draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusion,</b> but Phaedrus gives the story a context.

This would mean {{the birth of a}} second sun and the frogs suffer already from the drying up of the ponds and marshes in which they live.|$|R
40|$|With Hegel, the {{correspondence}} {{between nature and}} mind is self-evident, for what we recognize {{in the real world}} is nothing but a gradual realization of the Absolute Idea. It is only too logical to assume that thought can know a content which is from the outset its own thought-content. With Marx, who denies any independent pre-existence of mind, the identity of nature and mind is to be attained not through the premises that already contain <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusion,</b> but through human reflection of a world that exists independently of mind...|$|R

Another database, FSSP, is purely automatically generated (including regular automatic updates) but offers no classification, allowing the user to draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusion</b> as to the significance of structural relationships based on the pairwise comparisons of individual protein structures.|$|R
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{begins with}} Bond laying flowers {{at the grave}} of his wife Tracy Bond, before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas. Director John Glen referred to {{the identity of the}} villain obliquely: [...] "We just let people use their imaginations and draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions...</b> It's a legal thing". The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball, which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation SPECTRE, and other material associated with the development of Thunderball. Eon disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was [...] "a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Silent Alarm {{does not}} contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives. Okereke wanted to leave {{individual}} listeners space to make <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions,</b> but has admitted that the record [...] "operates {{in the realm of}} cultural politics". Much of the songwriting is inspired by the style of confessional poetry authors like Anne Sexton and musicians Thom Yorke and Björk. In general, Silent Alarm tries to make clear an existential pointlessness in life. With hindsight, Okereke noted themes of [...] "helplessness and weariness" [...] because of the album's focus on how he was feeling between the agesof18and20. Professor John Sutherland has pointed out literary elements, often similar to Sylvia Plath's work, in the lyricist's writing. Discussing the opening track [...] "Like Eating Glass", he explained, [...] "It strikes me that whoever did the lyrics must have read some of her work. It has the same rather jagged, surprising imagery. It could sit fairly comfortably in a poetry anthology." [...] The recurring line [...] "We've got crosses on our eyes" [...] is inspired by cartoon characters who have crosses on their eyes when they die. Okereke tried to convey the feelings in a failing relationship, [...] "of being completely disorientated", using childhood metaphors.|$|E
500|$|The film {{switches}} the infertility from male {{to female}} but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and {{others in the}} film) {{have been attributed to}} Cuarón's dislike for expository film: [...] "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. [...] And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema." [...] Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a [...] "metaphor for the fading sense of hope". [...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions</b> about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end." ...|$|E

Giddings and Mangano also referred to the research paper [...] "Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC", which relies on a number of new arguments to conclude that there is no risk due to mini black holes at the LHC. On 19 January 2009 Roberto Casadio, Sergio Fabi and Benjamin Harms posted on the arXiv a paper, later published on Physical Review D, ruling out the catastrophic growth of black holes in the scenario considered by Plaga. In reaction to the criticisms, Plaga updated his paper on the arXiv on 26 September 2008 and again on 9 August 2009. So far, Plaga's paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} are {{described}} by an Afrisson reviewer as [...] "intellectual", and their lyrics are often politically charged and advocate for rebuilding {{the country and}} Malagasy society and culture. The lyrics of Mahaleo's earlier songs in particular promoted the values of Marxism, reflecting the popularity of socialist philosophies as the best alternative to neocolonialism in Africa and other regions freeing themselves from the control of Europe; the group also commonly explored the themes of conflict, the political demands of the people, love, friendship and death. According to music producer Hannes Lämmler, [...] "These simple themes moved the Malagasy people, because they express the deepest aspirations of a people {{in search of an}} identity... with , the truth was affirmed {{that it is possible to}} be Malagasy and proud of it." [...] Over time, the themes explored in the songs of Mahaleo expanded to include social problems like criminality, environmental destruction and other contemporary social and political issues. Nearly all their songs reflect the ancestral value of fihavanana (kinship, solidarity) that forms the foundation of traditional Malagasy society. Unlike most bands, Mahaleo avoids prescribing particular solutions to each problem they address, preferring to draw upon the local traditions of hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) in order to inspire their listeners to reflect and draw <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>conclusions.</b>|$|E

Methods In a paper-and-pencil survey, questions were asked about the students' healthcare seeking behaviour and barriers. Differences according to residency were analysed with χ 2 -tests and regression models. Results The frequency of healthcare seeking behaviour varied according to residency, {{but none of the}} differences were statistically significant. Yet, a proportion of students living on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> visited primary healthcare providers less often after they changed residency (23. 7 % for general practitioner and 41. 8 % for dentist).
