5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds <b>the</b> <b>aquifer.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|About 92% of Bahrain is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing Bahrain include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of ground {{water from the}} Lower San Pedro River basin between Reddington and Mammoth, Arizona, was studied.

25|$|The Ogallala aquifer, or the High Plains aquifer, is an {{integral}} fresh water source for {{the entirety of the}} Great Plains region, providing drinking water to 80% of the population and irrigating 13 million acres of land.

25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E

The groundwater model can be manipulated to evaluate the effects of various parameters such as water film thickness, glacier basal melt rate, and glacier thickness. The model results indicate that the presence of a sub-glacial water film reduced the hydraulic gradient in <b>the</b> <b>aquifers</b> whereas <b>the</b> absence of a sub-glacial film resulted in significantly higher gradients in hydraulic head within <b>the</b> <b>aquifers.</b> These results suggest that the presence of a sub-glacial water film had a significant effect on the groundwater flow regime in <b>the</b> sub-glacial <b>aquifers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} hydrogeological {{model of}} the Viterbo thermal area in central Italy and the yield of the groundwater sys- tem have been examined. This area is of great geothermal interest. Through new investigations, three overlapping aquifers have been found. This study examines in detail <b>the</b> two shallower <b>aquifers,</b> characterized by different hydraulic and chemical characteristics. <b>The</b> first <b>aquifer</b> {{is related to the}} regional groundwater flow of the Cimino-Vico volcanic system and is generally characterized by cold, fresh waters used for irrigation and drinking water supply. <b>The</b> second <b>aquifer,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> thermal <b>aquifer,</b> supply thermal spas and public pools; it is present where the local hydrostratigraphic, structural and geothermal conditions permit a relatively active flow of higher salinity thermal waters (40 ?C - 62 ?C). These two aquifers interact vertically and laterally, giving rise to mixed waters circulating in <b>the</b> first <b>aquifer.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>aquifer</b> is recharged by direct infiltration and inflow from regional groundwater, as well as inflow from <b>the</b> second <b>aquifer.</b> <b>The</b> yield of <b>the</b> thermal <b>aquifer</b> is at least 170 L/s, discharging into thermal springs and wells, besides feeding <b>the</b> shallow <b>aquifer</b> vertically and laterally. Even if a future development of <b>the</b> second <b>aquifer</b> is potentially achievable on a global scale, the exploitation of the thermal waters is strictly dependent on the specific local hydrogeological equilibrium between <b>the</b> overlapping <b>aquifers,</b> different from place to place.

25|$|Subsidence {{occurs when}} {{too much water}} is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural {{equilibrium}} state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> and the aquitard supports some {{of the weight of}} the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> drop and compression of <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When <b>the</b> <b>aquifer</b> gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40cm (1'3") per year.|$|E
