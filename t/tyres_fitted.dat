She returned to Tyseley to await completion of the Darlington works. The elements of Tornado were brought together {{with the opening of}} Darlington Locomotive Works in 1997, and the opening ceremony saw the unveiled locomotive, now consisting of the frame with its three cylinders and cab attached.

25|$|After running closely behind {{teammate}} Rosberg {{and feeling}} the wind penetrating his visor, Hamilton got some dirt {{in his left}} eye on lap 66 and slowed down in the circuit's low-speed turns as a result, allowing Ricciardo to close up to Hamilton. Hülkenberg had heavily worn rear super soft tyres, and by the 69th lap, was caught by McLaren drivers Button and Magnussen. Bianchi {{was told that he}} needed a five-second advantage over Grosjean to negate the time penalty. Five laps later, Button overtook teammate Magnussen on the main straight for sixth, Räikkönen then attempted to do the same around the inside at the Loews hairpin on lap 74 but ran too deep, leaving both himself and Magnussen in the barrier. Both Räikkönen and Magnussen managed to reverse out of the barrier but lost a large amount of time, thus promoting Bianchi to eighth and Grosjean to ninth. Räikkönen had to make a third pit stop for a new front wing and had super soft <b>tyres</b> <b>fitted.</b>|$|E
25|$|Massa {{drew closer}} to Kvyat and passed him {{heading into the}} Senna chicane for fourth place on 17 while Alonso overtook Sutil at the same turn to move into tenth on the same lap. At the same time, Hülkenberg made his pit stop and rejoined the track in 15th position. Hamilton's right-front tyre was {{blistered}} which did not hinder him significantly upon setting a new fastest lap of the race to be 2.1 seconds behind Rosberg {{at the start of}} lap 20. The reduction of the lead was that Rosberg was aware of not causing a large amount of tyre stress and partly down to Hamilton being faster than him. The two drivers pulled away from Massa. Button drove closely behind Bottas and used his DRS to establish an advantage over the close group of teammate Magnussen, Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo. Magnussen steered to the left of Grosjean and passed him for sixth on lap 23 and Alonso attempted to pass Grosjean around the outside heading into the Senna chicane on the next lap but Grosjean defended his position. Alonso tried again on the main straight and passed Grosjean before turning into the Descida do Lago turn for seventh. Vettel also moved in front of Grojean at the corner. Massa served his five-second time penalty on the 26th lap, and upon taking it, had new <b>tyres</b> <b>fitted</b> on his car.|$|E

25|$|In LMP2 the No. 26 G-Drive Oreca of Rast and Rusinov {{took the}} fastest time at {{one minute and}} 48,985 seconds, {{securing}} the team's fourth consecutive class pole position of the season. The car was 0.743 seconds {{in front of the}} second-placed qualifier, the No. 36 Signatech Alpine, driven by Gustavo Menezes and Richelmi. Williamson, in his first World Endurance Championship qualifying session, recorded a time of one minute and 49.924 with Kane setting a one minute and 49.600 seconds circuit for an average lap total of one minute and 49.762 seconds. Thiim and Sørensen, competing in the No. 97 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a late two-lap average of two minutes and 1.712 seconds which was recorded when the track was at its driest. The No. 66 Ford GT of Stefan Mücke and Olivier Pla was 0.247 seconds off the place and had the class pole until the No. 97 Aston Martin's laps. Stanaway and Turner in the second Aston Martin qualified third in class, ahead of fourth-placed Bruni and Calado in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari. Bruni had slick dry <b>tyres</b> <b>fitted</b> to his car and went off the track at the Mercedes Arena exit which caused his pit crew to install intermediate tyres. Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing's No. 88 Porsche driven by Patrick Long and Khaled Al Qubaisi took the LMGTE Am pole position with an average time of two minutes and 6.011 seconds in the first qualifying session's closing minutes.

40|$|A wave {{model to}} predict the {{vibrational}} response of a pneumatic tyre subject to line force excitation is presented. The tread and sidewalls are each modelled as thin, flat orthotropic plates with in-plane tension, which are joined together by a translational stiffness, and to a rigid rim. The dynamic response of the tyre to harmonic excitation is decomposed into spatial harmonics around the circumference, and waves in the meridional direction. At low frequencies ( 500 Hz), the response tends towards that of an infinite orthotropic plate.

5000|$|The chassis {{featured}} a triple bulkhead monocoque {{made of a}} composite of carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb, which was manufactured by the Lille-based SNPE company. The bodywork was quite bulky, as the sidepods housed large water and oil coolers. The GD-01 had a conventional suspension, featuring wishbones with pushrod-actuated shock absorbers. The car {{featured a}} low-nose configuration, which was gradually being abandoned in favour of higher noses by other F1 teams at the time, although the Reynard engineers had tested both configurations. The car's overall aerodynamic package {{has been described by}} motorsport author Sam Collins as [...] "underdeveloped". The GD-01 was powered by a Ford Cosworth ED V8 engine - a new unit for the three-litre era of F1 that began in 1995 - which was a standard contemporary choice for smaller teams due to its low cost and ease of installation. The engine had a mileage of 400 mi before rebuilds, a weight of 129.5 kg, a rev limit of 13,500 rpm, and maximum power of [...] at 13,200 rpm. It was initially thought that the chassis would be powered by a Mugen-Honda engine as part of a low-key return to F1 for Honda, but negotiations between the parties came to nought. The car's transmission was a six-speed sequential unit built specially for the team by British company Xtrac, which also supplied the team's differential. Xtrac gearboxes were also used in the Minardi M195 and Simtek S951 chassis in 1995. The car's electronics were supplied by Pi Research, its Goodyear-supplied <b>tyres</b> <b>fitted</b> on Enkei wheels, and it was fuelled with Elf petrol. Only one chassis was built.|$|E
5000|$|Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the [...] "West Coast" [...] styled TSX was {{distinguished}} by its lowered chassis and 16 in rear wheel {{with the engine}} off-set in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re-styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75" [...] pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' stick on graphics outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. Paioli rear suspension units, with plastic top shrouds, were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned {{in place of the}} black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas headlamp with sealed beam was changed to the Lucas H4 early in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982-1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle <b>tyres</b> <b>fitted,</b> an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) [...] with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a unique swingarm and abbreviated chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crank with more careful machining; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a balance pipe situated {{on the front of the}} tank's underside.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost Formula One {{circuits}} use tyre barriers for crash protection. Generally, {{they are}} composed of bolted <b>tyres,</b> <b>fitted</b> by a conveyor belt to {{the face of the}} barriers. The barriers are placed against a rigid wall or a metallic safety barrier. When the protection area is too small, the rigidity of the lyre barrier is improved by polyethylene tubular inserts inside the tyres. The static and dynamic tests realized at the Ecole Centrale de Nantes present the energy boundary condition for the thermoplastic insert used at present. Thus, contrary to what is usually thought, the following studies show that a metallic insert solution is better from an energy dissipation point of view...|$|E
