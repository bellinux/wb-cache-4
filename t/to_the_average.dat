5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> length of jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation.

Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E
5|$|Parks and Recreations premiere {{was seen}} in 6.77 million households. Media outlets {{described}} this as a solid result, comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> Nielsen ratings for 30 Rock, another Thursday-night show on NBC. However, viewership declined almost every week {{over the rest of}} the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25 million households for the final episode. The average first season viewership was 5.45 million households per episode. The Office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. However, the low viewership presented a greater challenge for Parks and Recreation because NBC now trailed CBS, ABC and Fox in the ratings, and the move of comedian Jay Leno from The Tonight Show to a variety show in NBC's 10 p.m. weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule.|$|E

Several tropical depressions formed that did not attain tropical storm status, many of which formed beneath an unfavorable upper-level trough.|$|E
