5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch {{published}} {{a paper on}} early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. He found that although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and relatives were actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however that further work on the group might reveal different conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> freshwater crab in that country.

If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

The Fargo brothers (Don, Jackie, and Sonny), who also wrestled in tag team matches together despite not being related in real life, are scheduled to be inducted together in 2009.

5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Megalosaurus was, in 1824, {{the first}} genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The type species is Megalosaurus bucklandii, named in 1827. In 1842, Megalosaurus {{was one of}} three genera on which Richard Owen based his Dinosauria. On Owen's {{directions}} a model was made as one of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to M. bucklandii, which is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> Megalosaurus species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.|$|E

5|$|The second {{break from}} the kirk was also {{prompted}} by issues of patronage. Minister Thomas Gillespie (1708–74) was deposed by the General Assembly in 1752 after he refused to participate in inducting a minister to the Inverkeithing parish, since the parishioners opposed the appointment. Gillespie was joined by two other ministers and they held {{the first meeting of}} the Presbytery of Relief at Colinsburgh in Fife in 1761. While evangelical in doctrine, the Relief Church did not maintain that it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> church, but stated that it was still in communion with the kirk and maintained contact with Episcopalians and Independents. Like the Associate Presbytery, the movement was initially small, but benefited from the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century, which helped it expand rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{recruiting}} {{class was}} ranked 52nd {{in the nation}} by Scout.com and 38th by Rivals.com. Scout.com rated three recruits as four-star and six as three-star prospects, while Rivals.com rated six recruits each as four-star and three-star prospects. Kenny Tate, who was originally recruited as a wide receiver, was the only four-star prospect to see significant playing time in 2008. Before the season, he was converted to safety, a position that had been attrited by the graduation of former starters Christian Varner and J.J. Justice, and Tate also saw action on special teams. Cornerback Cameron Chism, who saw action in nine games as a reserve, recorded seven tackles on kickoff returns to tie for second on the team in special teams tackles. Tight end Matt Furstenburg saw limited play time on special teams against Delaware and Middle Tennessee, but injured his foot and was awarded a medical redshirt. Wide receiver Kevin Dorsey also sat out the season as a redshirt to recuperate from foot surgery. The other four-star recruits who sat out on redshirt status were wide receiver Kerry Boykins, tight end Devonte Campbell, and defensive tackle Masengo Kabongo. Running back Davin Meggett, the son of former New York Giants star Dave Meggett, was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> freshman to start a game for Maryland in 2008, {{and he was a}} significant contributor throughout the season. Meggett was not a highly touted recruit, assessed by Scout.com as a two-star prospect, and his only other scholarship offers were from local-area Division I FCS schools. In 2008, however, he led all ACC freshman with 5.13yards per carry, and Megett finished the season with 457yards and four touchdowns as a reserve.|$|E
