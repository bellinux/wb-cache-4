BWRs use an aqueous solution of boric acid and borax or Sodium Pentaborate for an emergency shut down system. Boric acid may be dissolved in spent fuel pools used to store spent fuel elements.

40|$|Studies of finer {{details in}} mass and charge {{distribution}} fission {{leads to a}} better understanding of the fission process. Experimental determination of independent and cumulative yields using radiochemical techniques as well as mass spectrometers and fission product recoil separators form the basis of such studies. It has been established that closed shells as well as an even number of nucleons influence both mass and charge distributions. The magnitudes of these effects may be estimated from existing experimental yield data and various fission models. Using our measurements of several fission yields and those existing in the literature we have calculated even-odd proton and neutron effects for various low energy fissioning systems. Where enough data existed, direct calculations were made, whereas for other cases the Zp-model of WAHL has been used. It is found that the even-odd proton effect is well established and pronounced in <b>thermal</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>fission</b> of 235 U and 233 U.

The second, on the fission fragment properties in the thermal fission of 234 U(n,f). The prompt <b>fission</b> <b>neutron</b> multiplicity has been measured at the JRC-IRMM using two liquid scintillators in coincidence with an ionization chamber. The first experimental campaign focused on 235 U(nth,f) whereas a second experimental campaign is foreseen later for the same reaction at 5. 5 MeV. The goal is to investigate how the so-called sawtooth shape changes as a function of fragment mass and excitation energy. Some harsh experimental conditions were experienced due to the large radiation background. The solution to this will be discussed along with preliminary results. In addition, the analysis of <b>thermal</b> <b>neutron</b> induced <b>fission</b> of 234 U(n,f) will be discussed. Currently analysis of data is ongoing, originally taken at the ILL reactor. The experiment is of particular interest since no measurement exist of the mass and energy distributions for this system at thermal energies.
