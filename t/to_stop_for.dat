5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27–28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had said that when they called out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E

25|$|Dining cars first {{appeared}} in the late 1870s and into the 1880s.

At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared.|$|E

25|$|The next {{crisis was}} {{followed}} by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the Berlin into east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north-south lines, trains were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> passengers and become Geisterbahnhöfe ("ghost stations"), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years {{is that most of the}} Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion.|$|E

25|$|The Action of 27 February 1941 was {{a single}} ship action between a New Zealand cruiser and an Italian {{auxiliary}} cruiser.

Instead of complying, the freighter, the , raised the Italian colours and engaged the cruiser, Leander sinking Ramb I shortly after. Most of the Italian crew were rescued and taken to Addu Atoll, then Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

25|$|Roundabouts can {{increase}} delays in locations where traffic would otherwise often {{not be required}} <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> <b>For</b> example, at the junction of a high-volume and a low-volume road, traffic on the busier road would stop only when cross traffic was present, otherwise not having to slow for the roundabout. When the volumes on the roadways are relatively equal, a roundabout can reduce delays, because half of the time a full stop would be required. Dedicated left turn signals (in countries where traffic drives on the right) further reduce throughput.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlers}} in the Cape were the Dutch who, in 1652, established a small supply station at present-day Cape Town for their trading ships <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> supplies en route {{to and from the}} East Indies.

By {{the second half of the}} 18th century, Europeans, predominantly trekboers, moved eastward up the coast and encountered the Xhosa in the region of the Great Fish River. The Xhosa were already established in the area and herded cattle. Competition for land ensued, particularly after the arrival of several groups of British {{settlers in}} 1820.|$|E

After the junk was recovered the following day, rifles, grenades, ammunition and documents were discovered.

Point Marone participated in the raid along with cutters Point Comfort and Point Grey by transporting civilian irregular defense group (CIDG) mercenaries and their Special Forces advisors to the raid and providing fire support with the 81mm mortar.|$|E
