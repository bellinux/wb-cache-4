According <b>to</b> <b>reports,</b> the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003.

5|$|By {{shortly after}} the passage of the storm, the {{government}} of Veracruz opened 6,000emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. Floodwaters from the rainfall inundated scores of houses and cars, with a total of 7,500families in Veracruz directly affected by the storm. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts of police officers and state officials, worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many waited on rooftops; according <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> from the Civil Defense of the government of Veracruz, a person drowned in the city of Cerro Azul. Several people were reported missing, as well. Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66villages temporarily isolated. Across Veracruz, the most affected localities were Naranjos, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Tamalín, Tantima, Benito Juárez, Tamiahua, and Tempoal de Sánchez. The government of Veracruz {{declared a state of emergency}} for 14 municipalities. Damage in the state totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD); the state government requested reconstruction aid amounting to the equivalent of the damage total.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, Japanese troops and sailors were again shipwrecked on Goodenough Island. Responding <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> from ANGAU, the police and civilian informants, patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors. In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943, the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42, and found another nine dead on a raft. A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats. In the boats they found documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document {{turned out to be a}} copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units never previously reported. Moreover, a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Money {{comes from}} Lebanese {{business}} groups, private persons, businessmen, the Lebanese diaspora involved in African diamond exploration, other Islamic groups and countries, and the taxes {{paid by the}} Shia Lebanese. Hezbollah says that {{the main source of}} its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims, however, Western sources maintain that Hezbollah actually receives most of its financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and Syria. Iran is said to have given $400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation. The situation has been changed due to economic problems, but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah. According <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400million from Iran. The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US$60–100million per year in financial assistance. Other estimates are as high as $200-million annually. In 2011 Iran earmarked $7 million to Hezbollah’s activities in the region.|$|E
50|$|From a legal perspective, {{the most}} serious {{criticism}} aside from the incidents {{of child sexual abuse}} themselves was by the bishops, who failed <b>to</b> <b>report</b> accusations <b>to</b> the police.

5|$|The Hamar-based {{newspaper}} Demokraten ("The Democrat") {{was started}} on 15 September 1909. The initiator and first editor was Olav Kringen, who had ample experience as {{the editor of}} Social-Demokraten from 1903 until 1906. Demokraten was the Labour Party organ for the Mjøsa Cities and Hedemarken, but in its first years it also covered Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen, two northern regions. The name Østoplandenes Socialistiske Partiblad was considered for the newspaper, but the historical name Demokraten prevailed. The name was suggested by local Labour MP Karl Amundsen. Demokratens coverage of Gudbrandsdalen soon ended, and in southern Østerdalen a new labour newspaper, Østerdalens Arbeiderblad, {{was set up in}} 1915. In northern Østerdalen, Arbeidets Rett was popular among the labour movement. According <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> in Demokraten the newspaper again began to cover news from a part of Gudbrandsdalen, namely the city Lillehammer, in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operational}} {{deployment of}} RAAF Hornets {{took place in}} 2001. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Australian Government agreed to deploy F/A-18s to protect the major USAF air base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, which was being used to mount operations in Afghanistan. Four No.77 Squadron Hornets and 70 personnel departed for the island on 9 November. No.3 Squadron pilots and ground crew relieved the No.77 Squadron personnel in early February 2002. RAAF Hornets were not assigned to the War in Afghanistan as {{at the time they}} were less capable than other available coalition aircraft. While the F/A-18s were occasionally scrambled in response <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> of aircraft near the base, no threat developed. The detachment returned to Australia on 21 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} sent from the {{ministry}} to the municipality, whose council passed the plans on 12 November 1908. Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could {{demand that the}} line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. The concession was again considered on 2 November 1911, {{and there it was}} decided that the concession would be removed if the line was not finished by the end of 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject <b>to</b> <b>reports</b> on the issue. The report suggested a different route, which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedgård. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien.|$|E
