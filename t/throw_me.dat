500|$|The {{daughter}} of billionaire Nikolas Natchios {{and the love}} interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norwegian {{magazine}} Rock Furore {{published an}} interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, {{he said of the}} prison system: [...] "It's much too nice here. It's not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet and shower. It's completely ridiculous. I asked the police to <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence". He was released in March for lack of evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Both Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have {{confirmed}} in separate interviews {{that they did}} not get along with each other during the making of What About Bob? In addition, the film's producer Laura Ziskin recalled having a disagreement with Murray that led to him tossing her into a lake. [...] Ziskin confirmed in 2003, [...] "Bill also threatened to <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot. [...] I was furious and outraged at the time, but having produced a dozen movies, I can safely say it is not common behavior." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. I never saw him - I don't know if he's the one that told my mother to <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> away. A pimp told my mother I had to go. They {{put me in a}} trash can and took off. Some people heard me crying. They thought it was a cat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garcia was well-noted for his [...] "soulful {{extended}} guitar improvisations", {{which would}} frequently feature interplay {{between him and}} his fellow band members. His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice. Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that [...] "there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [...] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary. [...] Harmonically, I take a lot of my solo cues from Bob." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gregory was {{physically}} exhausted and {{worried that he}} was losing {{the confidence of the}} bishops and the emperor. [...] Rather than press his case and risk further division, he decided to resign his office: [...] "Let me be as the Prophet Jonah! [...] I was responsible for the storm, but I would sacrifice myself for the salvation of the ship. [...] Seize me and <b>throw</b> <b>me...</b> I was not happy when I ascended the throne, and gladly would I descend it." [...] He shocked the Council with his surprise resignation and then delivered a dramatic speech to Theodosius asking to be released from his offices. The emperor, moved by his words, applauded, commended his labor and granted his resignation. The Council asked him to appear once more for a farewell ritual and celebratory orations. Gregory used this occasion to deliver a final address (Or. 42) and then departed.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1997, Graner's {{wife and}} mother of their two {{children}} filed for divorce and sought a protection order, saying Graner had threatened to kill her. A six-month order was granted, unopposed by Graner. Shortly after the first one expired, Staci Dean was granted a second protection order, saying Graner {{had come to her}} house, thrown her against some furniture, thrown her on the bed, grabbed her arm and hit her face with her arm. Three years later, Dean called police after Graner came to her house and attacked her. Dean said Graner had [...] "yanked me out of bed by my hair, dragging me and all the covers into the hall and tried to <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> down the steps." [...] Afterwards, Graner called a friend of Dean's and allegedly said, [...] "I have nothing if she's not my wife, she's dead." [...] Graner admitted the attack and a third order of protection was granted.|$|E

The next day, Popular Will leader Leopoldo Lopez {{announced}} that he would turn himself in to the Venezuelan government after one more protest saying, [...] "I haven't committed any crime. If there is a decision to legally <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> in jail I'll submit myself to this persecution." [...] On 17 February, [...] armed government intelligence personnel illegally forced their way into the headquarters of Popular Will in Caracas and held individuals that were inside at gunpoint. On 18 February, Lopez explained during his speech how he could have left the country, but [...] "stayed to fight for the oppressed people in Venezuela". Lopez surrendered to police after giving his speech and was transferred to the Palacio de Justicia in Caracas where his hearing was postponed until the next day.|$|E

2500|$|As Burns {{lacked the}} funds {{to pay for his}} passage to the West Indies, Gavin Hamilton {{suggested}} that he should [...] "publish his poems in the mean time by subscription, as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica." [...] On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson, a local printer in Kilmarnock, who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, {{on the same day that}} Jean Armour's father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, [...] "Armour has got a warrant to <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum... I am wandering from one friend's house to another." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw you {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could <b>throw</b> <b>me</b> off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and said quietly to Terry, [...] "I think I can do it." ...|$|E
