25|$|Israelis {{allege that}} Palestinians are {{deliberately}} removing {{significant amounts of}} archaeological evidence about the Jewish past of the site and claim to have found significant artifacts in the fill removed by bulldozers and trucks from the Temple Mount. Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount. Muslims allege that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>are</b> deliberately damaging the remains of Islamic-era buildings found in their excavations.|$|E

However, the PWA was able to drill new wells for only 30 mcm {{at the expense of the}} existing springs and wells. In the Oslo II Accord, <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>are</b> allotted four times the Palestinian portion or 80% of the joint-aquifer resources. However, 94% (340 mcm) of the Western Aquifer was allotted to the Israelis for use within Israel. The allowed quantities have not been adapted after the end of the supposed five years interim period. The parties established the Joint Water Committee to carry out the provisions of the concerning article 40 of Annex III.|$|E
