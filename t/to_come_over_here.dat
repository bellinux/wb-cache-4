2500|$|According to the Washington Times, Ritter's 2000 {{documentary}} In Shifting Sands {{was partially}} financed by Iraqi American businessman Shakir al Khafaji. Al-Khafaji {{pled guilty to}} multiple felony charges in 2004 for his relationship with U.N. Oil-for-Food scandal. [...] Ritter denied any quid pro quo with Al-Khafaji, according to Laurie Mylroie, writing in the Financial Times. When Ritter was asked [...] "how he would characterize anyone suggesting that Mr. Khafaji was offering allocations in [...] name", Mr. Ritter replied: [...] "I'd say that person's a fucking liar...and tell him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> so I can kick his ass." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He ought <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> and not {{stayed there}} by himself," [...] said the archdeacon, {{when his wife}} told him of her intention.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] he said, [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I am sure we haven't, because {{you are one of}} the men whom I hoped some day <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across <b>over</b> <b>here.</b> I couldn't {{possibly}} have forgotten a meeting with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{nice for}} you, Jimmy. Father came into money, too. That's how I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be <b>over</b> <b>here.</b> I wish you and father had got on better together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good. I shall {{look into}} the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just {{possible}} that I may have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> again before evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{never wore}} glad rags like {{them in the}} old country," [...] Billy sneered. [...] "They had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> to get decent clothes and decent grub. They're as fat as butterballs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Potter," [...] she said, excitedly, [...] "run {{over to the}} Kings' {{and tell}} Eben <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> immediately--no matter what he's at. Tell him I {{want to see him}} about {{something}} of the greatest importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a strange step to have taken, Dr. Ashleigh, in the {{position}} in which we stand to each other, {{for me to have}} asked you <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> had I not had very powerful reasons for so doing. But it appears to me that I have, for I have very strong suspicions concerning the events which have taken place here in the last two days. Have you heard the particulars?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{looked a}} little foolish. [...] "The truth is, Teacher," [...] said he very humbly, [...] "I have been visiting the Old Orchard so much and {{learning}} {{so many things that}} this is the first chance I have had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> 'way <b>over</b> <b>here</b> in the Green Forest. You see, I have been learning a lot of things about you feathered folks, things I hadn't even guessed. There is something I wish you'd tell me, Teacher; will you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When Jerry tells Elaine what he said, Elaine is alarmed {{and shows}} some uncharacteristic consideration: [...] "I don't want John {{thinking}} that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy. I'm {{trying to get}} a little squirrel <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> me <b>here.</b> I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eustace? Did {{you ever}} see him? That {{accounts}} for your question. He only left France long enough <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> and make love to her, and he swears he'll never leave it again. If she divorces him, he'll have to have alimony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From New York," [...] said Mr. Fyshe. [...] "He {{is staying}} at the Grand Palaver. I sent a {{telegram}} through one of our New York directors of the Traction, and his Grace has very kindly promised <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> to dine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is exactly}} the sort of weather we have in England!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "If that's all these foreigners can manage in their own country, what right have they <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> as they do, and grumble about our weather?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean well, I know," [...] she answered, [...] "but you {{are asking}} impossibilities. If you should happen <b>to</b> <b>come</b> across me <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> you will {{understand}} what I mean. I {{am going to do}} things which very likely you would be ashamed to think that any friend of yours would do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{could not}} have done much harm with the few they wanted, and it would have saved you a good deal of unpleasantness. I didn't like the way the boys were talking, and it was quite plain the men who kept their heads were anxious. In fact, two or three of them offered <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and sleep <b>here</b> until the dissatisfaction had simmered down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like that!" [...] {{the other}} said, with a laugh. [...] "You were my guide and {{counselor}} for five years, {{and now you}} pretend that I always have my own way. Why, I cannot even get my own way in persuading you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and settle <b>over</b> <b>here.</b> I am quite sure that you would get lots of pupils, when people understand the system and its advantages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{there is}} in me of extravagance," [...] she said, laying her hand for a moment upon his arm, [...] "I owe to you. Who else would have cabled to all my people <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> for such an {{unimportant}} function as my wedding!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we've known 'bout that always," [...] was the reply. [...] "Ned Joselyn {{used to come}} to {{our house}} ever so many times by the river stones, to talk with Ol' Swallertail, an' Gran'dad used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here,</b> to this same summer-house, an' talk with Joselyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature laughed. [...] "So I have," [...] said she. [...] "That {{will never}} do, {{never in the}} world. Johnny and his relatives, the Marmots, {{certainly}} cannot be overlooked.

60|$|Followed {{a golden}} week. From dawn till dark {{a row of}} canoes rested on their paddles two hundred feet away. This was the deadline. Rapa sailors, armed with rifles, {{maintained}} it. But one canoe at a time was permitted alongside, and but one black at a time was permitted <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> the rail. <b>Here,</b> under the awning, relieving one another in hourly shifts, the four white men carried on the trade. The rate of exchange was that established by Pankburn with One-Eye. Five sovereigns fetched a stick of tobacco; a hundred sovereigns, twenty sticks. Thus, a crafty-eyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in gold, and go back over the rail, hugely-satisfied, with forty cents' worth of tobacco in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Being in Washington {{on a visit}} at the time, 'the old gray' {{went over}} to Baltimore, and though ill from paralysis, consented to hobble up and silently take {{a seat on the}} platform, but refused to make any speech, saying, 'I have felt a strong impulse <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and be <b>here</b> to-day myself in memory of Poe, which I have obey'd, but not the {{slightest}} impulse to make a speech, which, my dear friends, must also be obeyed.' In an informal circle, however, in conversation after the ceremonies, Whitman said: 'For a long while, and until lately, I had a distaste for Poe's writings. I wanted, and still want for poetry, the clear sun shining, and fresh air blowing--the strength and power of health, not of delirium, even amid the stormiest passions--with always the background of the eternal moralities. Non-complying with these requirements, Poe's genius has yet conquer'd a special recognition for itself, and I too have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fully admit it, and appreciate it and him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was my clerk, {{the son of}} a man of some {{influence}} at Bruges. He was well recommended <b>to</b> me, and <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> learn the business and the language, with the intention of going into trade for himself. It was not long before I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> dislike his ways, and when, a fortnight since, he asked me for the hand of my daughter, I repulsed him, telling him that in the first place, she was too young to think of marriage, and that, in the second, I liked him not, and would never give my consent to her having him, and lastly, that she liked him as little as I did. He answered insolently, and I then expelled him from the house, when he threatened me that I should erelong regret my conduct. I gave the fellow no further thought, and did not know where he bestowed himself. Doubtless he was waiting to see whether this rabble would reach London and what would come of it, and when they entered doubtless he endeavoured to gratify his hatred by leading some of them hither. And now, Joanna, tell me what befell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He hung about, not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> afore dark, but he'll be here soon,' replied Chitling.

6000|$|MRS O'FLAHERTY. Good men is it! Good men! <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> {{when they}} were wounded {{because it was a}} Catholic country, and then to go to the Protestant Church because it didn't cost them anything, and some of them to never go near a church at all.

"Look a here; I've got a pair a earbobs and a handkercher pin I'm a goin' to give you, if you'll have them; for you're {{the very}} moral o' Lizy Sylvester, poor Eph's wife: that's why I signalled you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here.</b> They aint much, I guess, but they'll do to {{memorize}} the rebs by." ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a matter}} of pride and {{pleasure}} for me to deliver this 13 th Series of Shri Rajakrishna Jain Memorial Lectures at this reputed University of Delhi, under the benign auspices of the Department of Buddhist Studies. My pride implies the fact, that these lectures happen to be on Sravakacara [...] - the Jaina Code of Conduct for Householders, and the late Shri Rajakrishnaji, in whose honour they have been instituted by the R. K. Jain Charitable Trust. He was an illustrious sravaka with exemplary dedication to numerous religious, social, national and humanitarian causes, that have left a lasting impression on certain spheres of the present day society of Delhi. Moreover his son, Shri Prem Chandraji Jain, is also a worthy sravaka, who has been treading the same righteous path with all sincerity, devotion, and charity. My pleasure, of course, immanates from my compliance with my acceptance of the kind invitation of R. K. Jain Memorial Lectures Committee, by duly preparing and delivering this Series of Lectures, which the undertaking was quite hindered by my ill health during the month of April last year, when the scheduled program of these lectures had to be postponed indefinitely. Fortunately, I have been now, able <b>to</b> travel and <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> and appear before all of you...|$|R
5000|$|In late 2008, The Temper Trap started {{recording}} {{their debut}} album, Conditions, in Melbourne with engineering by record producer Kalju Tonuma. They travelled to the UK and {{attracted the attention}} of the local music industry after playing at the Musexpo in London in October. By January 2009, the band had signed to Infectious Records for European releases. The BBC chose The Temper Trap in its top 15 Sound of 2009 list. In March, the band finished recording Conditions in London with UK music producer Jim Abbiss. Mandagi said his key influences when recording it had included Radiohead, Prince, Massive Attack and U2. In May, after performing at South by Southwest in March, they signed to Glassnote Records for US releases. The album was released in Australia on 19 June and debuted at No. 9 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. It was released in the UK in August. The band had returned to London in early May to [...] "spend a bit of time on the continent and try and build a fan base over here", according to Sillitto. He says [...] "it was always our dream <b>to</b> at least <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> and give it a good crack early on".|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} French grew weary of this horrible bloodshed; but, {{as they could}} not manage themselves, a soldier named Napoleon Bonaparte, by his great cleverness and the {{victories}} he gained over other nations, succeeded in getting all the power. His victories were wonderful. He beat the Germans, the Italians, the Russians, and conquered wherever he went. There was only one nation he never could beat, {{and that was the}} English; though he very much wanted <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> with a great fleet and army, and have conquered our island. All over England people got ready. All the men learnt something of how to be soldiers, and made themselves into regiments of volunteers; and careful watch was kept against the quantities of flat-bottomed boats that Bonaparte had made ready to bring his troops across the English Channel. But no one had ships and sailors like the English; and, besides, they had the greatest sea-captain who ever lived, whose name was Horatio Nelson. When the French went under Napoleon to try to conquer Egypt and all the East, Nelson went after them with his ships, and beat the whole French fleet, though it was a great deal larger than his own, {{at the mouth of the}} Nile, blowing up the Admiral's ship, and taking or burning many more. Afterward, when the King of Denmark was being made to take part against England, Nelson's fleet sailed to Copenhagen, fought a sharp battle, and took all the Danish ships. And lastly, when Spain had made friends with France, and both their fleets had joined together against England, Lord Nelson fought them both off Cape Trafalgar, and gained the greatest of all his victories; but it was his last, for a Frenchman on the mast-head shot him through the backbone, and he died the same night. No one should ever forget the order he gave to all his sailors in all the ships before the battle-- [...] "England expects every man to do his duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} Helen {{raised her head}} and {{interrupted}} her guest's commiserating comment. [...] "Yes, {{you can do something}} for me.

Will you do this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he? I shouldn't {{wonder if}} the poor devil would be glad enough to be {{relieved}} from it all. I'll tell you what I'll do, Ricketts. I'll write to Miss Brodrick's father, and ask him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> before the trial.

You can't help {{having a}} certain feeling for it. That's human nature.... But {{tell me something}} about yourself. Hogan told me you had... tasted the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Added to which," [...] Hebblethwaite continued, [...] "he <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> charged, as {{you might}} say, almost with a special mission.
