40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} {{study was to examine}} the extent to which pretreatment characteristics influence <b>therapist</b> treatment adherence by using data sampled from a randomized effectiveness trial and an efficacy study. Research suggests that youth-, family-, and therapist-level pretreatment characteristics influence <b>therapist</b> behavior; however, this area is underdeveloped as most studies have focused on externalizing problem areas, family-based approaches, and the use of parent or <b>therapist</b> report to assess for <b>therapist</b> adherence. To date, no research has examined this question with anxiety as the target problem, individual-focused CBT, and with observational <b>therapist</b> adherence data. An observational coding measure, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Adherence Scale for Youth Anxiety, was used to assess <b>therapist</b> adherence to CBT for youth anxiety. Hierarchical linear model analyses were conducted to estimate changes in <b>therapist</b> adherence over time, based on youth-, family-, and therapist-level pretreatment characteristic predictors. Results suggest that youth ethnicity/race, <b>therapist</b> openness to evidence-based practices, <b>therapist</b> theoretical orientation, and <b>therapist</b> age influence the process of therapy: in this case, <b>therapist</b> adherence. The current study provides essential evidence about potentially important predictors of <b>therapist</b> adherence for CBT youth anxiety and points to important clinical and treatment adoption implications...|$|R

Previous research suggested that <b>therapist</b> scores on the NEO-PI- 3 domains of neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness would correlate with patient and <b>therapist</b> ratings of the working alliance as measured by the Working Alliance Inventory. It was hypothesized that <b>therapist</b> scores on the domains of the NEO-PI- 3 would have a positive correlation with patient ratings of the working alliance. It was also predicted that <b>therapist</b> scores in the domains of extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness would have a positive relationship with <b>therapist</b> ratings of the alliance but that <b>therapist</b> scores in the domain of neuroticism would have a negative correlation with <b>therapist</b> rated alliance scores.

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family <b>Therapists,</b> Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E

40|$|Conceptualization {{psychotherapy}} as an interpersonal influence process emphasizes how a <b>therapist</b> {{is perceived}} by a client. Factors affecting a client's early impressions of a <b>therapist</b> could influence therapeutic interactions since first impressions are relatively stable. The study investigated effects of nonverbal behavior and gender during a simulated initial meeting between a <b>therapist</b> and client. Undergraduates (N = 466) viewed a {{male or female}} <b>therapist</b> interviewing with a new female client. <b>Therapist</b> gaze. (100 %, 80 %, 40 %) and smiling (high, low) were manipulated. After subjects viewed one of 12 videotapes, they completed questionnaires rating <b>therapist</b> expertness, trustworthiness, attractiveness, masculinity and femininity. A comparison of the <b>therapist</b> with subjects' expectations of a <b>therapist</b> in general was obtained by pre- and post-testing utilizing a measure of client expectations. MANOVAs were performed on all ratings except expectation scores, where an ANCOVA was utilized. Main effects for <b>therapist</b> gender indicated the female <b>therapist</b> was rated as significantly more expert, attractive, trustworthy and feminine than the male (ps <. 81). For ratings of masculinity, subject gender interacted with <b>therapist</b> gender (p <. 001). Wain effects showed that high smiling was rated as more attractive and more feminine (ps <. 01). Smiling and level of gaze interacted on ratings of trustworthiness, expertness and masculinity (ps <. 04). The 100 per cent and 80 per cent gaze levels increased expertness, trustworthiness and masculinity ratings. Smiling affected expertness at the 80 per cent level, and trustworthiness and masculinity at the 40 per cent level. Analysis of the expectation scores resulted in a three-way interaction between subject gender, smiling and gaze (p <. 02). The results suggested that female subjects expected more responsive <b>therapist</b> behavior. The results suggested that the ratings of {{the male and female}} <b>therapist</b> reflected both the use of sex stereotypes and the influence of the <b>therapist</b> role.

5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment <b>therapists.</b> Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of reviewThe {{purpose of}} this review {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} and critical examination of the empirical literature about the relation between patient personality and <b>therapist</b> countertransference. Recent findingsThe <b>therapist's</b> countertransference can {{play a crucial role in}} psychotherapy outcomes, especially in the treatment of personality disorders. The <b>therapist's</b> emotional responses to patients can accomplish the following: inform the clinician about the patient's personality, impact therapy outcome, influence patient resistance and elaboration, mediate the influence of the <b>therapist's</b> interventions and influence therapeutic alliance. SummaryIn the last years, several studies have empirically demonstrated the presence of a specific pattern of <b>therapist</b> responses that are related to different patient personality disorders. Other works showed how the effects of the <b>therapist's</b> technique depend on the emotional context in which they are delivered and in particular countertransference experiences. Moreover, researchers suggest that the <b>therapist's</b> emotional responses occur across all kinds of therapy and are independent of the <b>therapist's</b> theoretical preferences. Keyword...|$|R
5000|$|Transference can be {{described}} as the client's distorted perceptions of the <b>therapist.</b> This can have a great effect on the therapeutic relationship. For instance, the <b>therapist</b> may have a facial feature that reminds the client of their parent. Because of this association, if the client has significant negative or positive feelings toward their parent, they may project these feelings onto the <b>therapist.</b> This can affect the therapeutic relationship in a few ways. For example, if the client has a very strong bond with their parent, they may see the <b>therapist</b> as a father or mother figure and have a strong connection with the <b>therapist.</b> This can be problematic because as a <b>therapist,</b> it is not ethical to have a more than [...] "professional" [...] relationship with a client. It can also be a good thing, because the client may open up greatly to the <b>therapist.</b> In another way, if the client has a very negative relationship with their parent, the client may feel negative feelings toward the <b>therapist.</b> This can then affect the therapeutic relationship as well. For example, the client may have trouble opening up to the <b>therapist</b> because he or she lacks trust in their parent (projecting these feelings of distrust onto the <b>therapist).</b>|$|R
