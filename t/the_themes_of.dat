5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
