5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have liked {{in the first few}} episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E
5|$|Tomlinson {{chose not}} to renew his Barrow {{contract}} {{at the end of}} the season, and instead signed a one-year contract at Port Vale in May 2010.

This required him to accept a lower wage <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have got at Barrow.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

He left school with A-levels in French, German, and geography, and took casual {{employment}} to earn money. Having a desire {{to make use of}} his language qualifications, he began applying for jobs at multi-national companies. He applied to Her Majesty's Civil Service and passed the civil service exam, but was keen to join the Foreign Service. He took and passed a second exam to join the Foreign Service, but had to enter at a lower grade <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have held in the Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is a 1927 British silent film, and Alfred Hitchcock's second as director, {{following}} The Pleasure Garden. The film, {{a romantic}} melodrama set in Kentucky, {{is about a}} widower (Bernhard Goetzke) who jealously competes with his crippled son (John F. Hamilton) and a man he loathes (Malcolm Keen) over the affections of a schoolteacher (Nita Naldi). The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of 1925, with exterior scenes shot {{in the village of}} Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique.|$|E
5|$|The late preseason saw {{a wave of}} signings {{of players}} cut by other teams, {{particularly}} the Bengals and Colts. Signees included Isaac Hagins, Danny Reece, Dave Green, and Jack Novak, with Ira Gordon and camp standout Jim Cagle among those waived to make roster space for them. Running back Charlie Davis was also obtained via trade. The moves left the team with nine former Bengals on their roster, a situation they expected, as they knew that Bengals owner Paul Brown had more young talent <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to keep}} on his team. Linebacker Richard Wood was obtained from the New York Jets for a future draft choice, with injury-plagued running back Harold Hart placed on injured reserve to make roster space for him. Wood was the final roster addition of the preseason, and became the fifth ex-USC player on the roster.|$|E
50|$|During {{his four}} {{seasons with the}} Capitals, his hard-nosed style of play would make him a fan favorite, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not {{hesitate}} to fight players much bigger <b>than</b> <b>he</b> was. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> play three more seasons in the minors for the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League before retiring in 1999.|$|R

5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having marital problems when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve turned her back on Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> like to admit. Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note, however, that alcohol myopia's effects on excessive behavior do not incite aggression in all drinkers.

The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1½ seasons, which is $7 million less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|One evening late in 1919, {{after moving}} to Michigan, Smith was baby-sitting (presumably for Roderick) while his wife {{attended}} a movie; he resumed work on The Skylark of Space, finishing it {{in the spring of}} 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of Argosy, sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers. (According to , but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, Skylark III, before the first book was accepted.) Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of Amazing Stories, he submitted it to that magazine; it was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125. It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues and it was such a success that managing editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.|$|E
25|$|In essence Spencer's {{philosophical}} {{vision was}} formed {{by a combination of}} deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth century deism from his father {{and other members of the}} Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost sub-conscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy.|$|E
