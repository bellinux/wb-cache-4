It cost at least £3,100, £1,300 of which came from the {{proceeds}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, with chalk, stone and timber being brought across from the neighbouring Isle of Wight. The castle was completed by October and formed a fortification with a square keep, rectangular gun platforms to the east and west, and angled bastions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear. Chatterton was appointed the new captain, with a team of eight soldiers, twelve gunners and a porter. The castle was well-armed, with seven brass artillery pieces - a culverin, demi-culverin, cannon and demi-cannon - and eight iron guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Floyd accelerated {{to the north}} in the western Caribbean Sea, due to an approaching cold front. Steadily intensifying, the storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Unexpectedly the storm turned sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Floyd briefly attained hurricane status on October12. Around the same time, the nearby cold front spawned a low pressure area that cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was rapidly decreasing over the center due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> <b>and</b> shortly thereafter Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery, although surface observations indicated it passed just south of Miami, Florida. The storm underwent extratropical transition as it weakened over the Bahamas, and Floyd {{was no longer a}} tropical cyclone by late on October18. The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day.|$|E
5|$|After the {{repeated}} German counterattacks prevented any lasting roadblock Truscott finally allowed reinforcements from the 45thDivision to support Dahlquist at Montélimar, {{as he felt}} the successful operations further south at the French ports allowed him to refocus to the north. At the same time, the Germans also reinforced their fighting force. Over the next days a stalemate emerged, with the Allies unable to block the retreat route and the Germans unable to clear {{the area of the}} Allied forces. Both sides became increasingly frustrated during the fighting, with attack, counterattack, and spoiling attacks, which made it hard for the 36thDivision to launch a decisive offensive. Whilst the 36thDivision had surrounded the 19thArmy, they themselves were almost surrounded, too, during the chaotic fighting, with only a thin supply route to the east open, resulting in their having to fight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> the rear. As the 36thDivision was seemingly making no progress, an angry Truscott arrived at Dahlquist's headquarters on 26August to relieve him of command. However, on seeing the heavy terrain and shattered forces, he refrained and left the headquarters again. Finally, during 26–28August, the majority of the German forces were able to escape, leaving behind 4,000 burnt-out vehicles and 1,500 dead horses. On 29August the Allies captured Montélimar, and the final German troops trying to break out surrendered. The Germans suffered 2,100 battle casualties plus 8,000 POWs, while the Americans had 1,575 casualties. Total POW losses of the 19thArmy now amounted to 57,000.|$|E

5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he felt he could work with, expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time acclimatising.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the battalions of the Australian Corps {{were removed}} from the line for rest on 5 October, after a request from the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. They had been {{severely}} depleted and were suffering from acute manpower shortages {{as a result of the}} combination of a decrease in the number of volunteers from Australia and the decision to grant home leave to men who had served for over four years. Subsequently, when the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, the Australian Corps had not returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> was still in the rear reorganising and training. With the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began, and men were slowly repatriated back to Australia. The process took a considerable period of time, though, and a large number of men were able to undertake tertiary and vocational training in England and France to prepare for their return to civilian life. Finally, as numbers dwindled, the battalion was disbanded on 4 June 1919.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of {{the roof of the}} braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of}} the bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
5|$|Southsea Castle, {{historically}} {{also known}} as Chaderton Castle, South Castle and Portsea Castle, is an artillery fort originally constructed by Henry VIII on Portsea Island, Hampshire, in 1544. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Solent and the eastern approach to Portsmouth. The castle had a square central keep, two rectangular gun platforms {{to the east and}} west, and two angled bastions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>and</b> rear, and was an early English example of the trace italienne-style of fortification popular on the Continent. The Cowdray engraving of the Battle of the Solent in 1545 depicted Henry VIII visiting the castle. Despite several serious fires, it remained in service and saw brief action {{at the start of the}} English Civil War in 1642 when it was stormed by Parliamentary forces.|$|E
