60|$|And Jane Withersteen {{suddenly}} {{suffered a}} paralyzing affront to her consciousness of reverence by some strange, irresistible twist of <b>thought</b> <b>wherein</b> she saw this Bishop as a man. And the {{train of thought}} hurdled the rising, crying protests of that other self whose poise she had lost. It was not her Bishop who eyed her in curious measurement. It {{was a man who}} tramped into her presence without removing his hat, who had no greeting for her, who had no semblance of courtesy. In looks, as in action, he made her think of a bull stamping cross-grained into a corral. She had heard of Bishop Dyer forgetting the minister in the fury of a common man, and now she was to feel it. The glance by which she measured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary. He looked a rancher; he was booted, spurred, and covered with dust; he carried a gun at his hip, and she remembered that he had been known to use it. But during the long moment while he watched her there was nothing commonplace in the slow-gathering might of his wrath.|$|E
60|$|I well {{remember}} that suggestions arising from this ballad, led {{us into a}} train of <b>thought</b> <b>wherein</b> there became manifest an opinion of Usher's which I mention {{not so much on}} account of its novelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around-- above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him--what he was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.|$|E
50|$|The Atharvaveda, {{like other}} Vedic texts, states William Norman Brown, {{goes beyond the}} duality of heaven and hell, and speculates {{on the idea of}} Skambha or Brahman as the all {{pervasive}} monism. Good and evil, Sat and Asat (truth and untruth) are conceptualized differently in these hymns of Atharvaveda, and the Vedic <b>thought,</b> <b>wherein</b> these are not dualistic explanation of nature of creation, universe or man, rather the text transcends these and the duality therein. Order is established out of chaos, truth is established out of untruth, by a process and universal principles that transcend good and evil.|$|E

40|$|Trance is an {{absorptive}} {{state of}} consciousness characterized by narrowed awareness of external surroundings and has long been used-for example, by shamans-to gain insight. Shamans across cultures often induce trance by listening to rhythmic drumming. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), we examined the brain-network configuration associated with trance. Experienced shamanic practitioners (n = 15) listened to rhythmic drumming, and either entered a trance state or remained in a nontrance state during 8 -min scans. We analyzed changes in network connectivity. Trance was associated with higher eigenvector centrality (i. e., stronger hubs) in 3 regions: posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and left insula/operculum. Seed-based analysis revealed increased coactivation of the PCC (a default network hub involved in internally oriented cognitive states) with the dACC and insula (control-network regions involved in maintaining relevant neural streams). This coactivation suggests that an internally oriented neural stream was amplified by the modulatory control network. Additionally, during trance, seeds within the auditory pathway were less connected, possibly indicating perceptual decoupling and suppression of the repetitive auditory stimuli. In sum, trance involved coactive default and control networks, and decoupled sensory processing. This network reconfiguration may promote an extended internal train of <b>thought</b> <b>wherein</b> integration and insight can occur...|$|E
40|$|Martin Heidegger’s lecture in 1964 ›The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking‹ {{signaled}} a {{crisis and the}} acknowledgement of substantial changes within Western philosophy. Reflecting upon the concept of critical dialogue among World Philosophies (WP) {{can be seen as}} a corrective of this crisis and a novel advancement. I aim to substantiate this by referring to the work of three authors: i) Jean-Luc Marion’s reflections on Heidegger will give us the chance to overcome a narrow understanding of ›philosophy‹ and the possibility of discovering »new horizons« for the discipline which are revealed as a »donation« towards »wisdom«; ii) Reyes Mate’s considerations on ›Thinking in Spanish‹ will offer, aided by Walter Benjamin, a concrete example for renegotiating the space and the place for those »excluded from thinking«; and iii) Paul Ricoeur’s meditation On Translation puts forward the ethical element of »linguistic hospitality« and transformation of the self when encountering alterity. While it is impossible to do justice to these authors in a short article, I maintain that their work deserves close attention because it depicts the struggle within Western philosophy on its way towards maturity: still entangled with so many challenges derived from its troubled history, this maturity appears only faintly, on the horizon, precisely, in the form of ›traces‹. On these grounds, I believe that Anglo-European philosophy can no longer postpone opening up to an indispensable dialogue with other systems of <b>thought</b> <b>wherein</b> the presence of WP and the renewed effort of many philosophers committed to this endeavour is recognised. ...|$|E
40|$|The Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is {{an enigmatic}} group of terrain {{features}} which dominate {{a quarter of}} equatorial Mars (extending - 5, 500 km east-west). The MFF is characterised by a discontinuous, highly eroded appearance and is inferred to comprise fine grained and friable materials. This long-standing interpretation is based on observations of the prevalent aeolian erosional features (yardangs), This thesis aims to improve constraint of both the materials ori gins and the processes at work during and since their emplacement. The project uses a multi-scale, geomorphological approach, and uses the latest very high resolution (25 cm/pixel), and new medium resolution (6 - 12 m/pixel), high spatial coverage data and attempts to use surface characteristics to constrain {{the origin of the}} formation. This thesis describes surveys of outlying MFF materials (to infer the palaeo-extent of the MFF), and a survey of textural characteristics of the outcrop materials and the quantitative analysis of yardangs. Following on from this, an evaluation of existing facies mapping (to improve understanding of the formation and evolution of the MFF) is discussed. A survey, and detailed study in one location, of sinuous ridge features (to evalu ate the role of volatiles and fluvial transport in the MFF) is also included. The key results include a larger pre-erosional spatial extent for the formation than previously <b>thought,</b> <b>wherein</b> outliers of the MFF are found on the Tharsis volcanic region and a hitherto unmapped uppermost "draping" unit is present. The existing definition of the geological members is found to require refinement. Furthermore, volatile content within the MFF is judged to be heterogeneous, and not limited to the oldest stratigraphic units. The evidence collated in this work is consistent with the hypothesis that the Medusae Fossae Formation is an ignimbrite deposit, comprised largely of dry (at least today), low density materials. but some MFF regions had much higher volatile content than others in the past.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the way Romantic-period philosophers, artists and writers were critically engaged with various Romantic-period disciplines, those branches of learning that were complexly enmeshed with the inhuman and putting increasing pressure {{on the concept of}} “the human. ” Over the course of five chapters, this study pursues the problematic of “the human” across the borders of philosophy, where Immanuel Kant entertains extraterrestrials while organizing the new discipline of pragmatic anthropology; the early and late illuminated work of poet-engraver William Blake, which enables us to think the inhumanities within the human; the closet drama and poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley, which think the inhumanity of life; and the fiction of Mary Shelley, as a thought experiment about the end of man and posthuman survival of man’s cultural achievements. “The Romantic Posthuman and Posthumanities” analyzes the human at its borders with the inhuman in Romantic literature. It examines the erosion of these borders through the way key disciplines (aesthetics, literature) were thematized in literary texts by Blake and the Shelleys. This thesis makes the case that a theoretical thinking about the end of man, of a humanism associated with man and his disciplinary formations, and a reflection on what comes after this end, all have their inception in Romantic thought. Here, Romanticism is a sign of history for man’s fragilization, for a privileged conception of man and of a certain understanding of life, a counter-discourse to Enlightenment humanism. What emerges – and this is the real importance of this endeavour – is a more comprehensive portrait {{of the ways in which}} the human and a decidedly humanistic understanding of life in the long Romantic period were widely and complexly enmeshed with – to follow Blake – an “innumerable company” of inhumans, including ether, rocks, plants, infusoria, and animals. This study reflects on our contemporary lives within what is increasingly being called the “posthumanities,” and hopes that as we move towards this new humanities we will acknowledge and better understand our debt to Romantic thought, our model for a hybridized interdisciplinary <b>thought</b> <b>wherein</b> art and science, human and inhuman are frequently entwined...|$|E
