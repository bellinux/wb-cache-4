Although a surface exposure of about 2 km² is highly siliceous, similar to the sinter of an epithermal hot spring-related precious metal deposit, the alteration assemblages (propylitic, high temperature corundum-andalusite, phyllic and argillic) present on surface, in subsurface exposures and diamond drill core, more closely approximate assemblages of a deeper porphyry system. Major oxide data indicate that MgO, CaO, and Na₂O were depleted, and Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ were added during hydrothermal alteration coincident with metalisation. Porphyry deposits are known to contain recoverable quantities of gold, however, a low potential for {{open pit and underground}} gold ore was demonstrated by the results of the 1984 exploration program.

40|$|The Hall effect, the {{anomalous}} Hall {{effect and}} the spin Hall effect are fundamental transport processes in solids {{arising from the}} Lorentz force and the spin-orbit coupling respectively. The quantum versions of the Hall effect and the spin Hall effect have been discovered in recent years. However, the quantized anomalous Hall (QAH) effect {{has not yet been}} realized experimentally. In a QAH insulator, spontaneous magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling combine to give rise to a topologically non-trivial electronic structure, leading to the quantized Hall effect without any external magnetic field. In this work, based on state-of-art first principles calculations, we predict that the <b>tetradymite</b> semiconductors Bi$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $, Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $, and Sb$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $ form magnetically ordered insulators when doped with transition metal elements (Cr or Fe), in sharp contrast to conventional dilute magnetic semiconductor where free carriers are necessary to mediate the magnetic coupling. Magnetic order in two-dimensional thin films gives rise to a topological electronic structure characterized by a finite Chern number, with quantized Hall conductance $e^{ 2 }/h$. Experimental realization of the long sought-after QAH insulator state could enable robust dissipationless charge transport at room temperature. Comment: 19 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{electronic}} band structures and concomitant Fermi surfaces {{for a family}} of exfoliable <b>tetradymite</b> compounds with the formula T_ 2 Ch_ 2 Pn, obtained as a modification to the well-known topological insulator binaries Bi_ 2 (Se,Te) _ 3 by replacing one chalcogen (Ch) with a pnictogen (Pn) and Bi with the tetravalent transition metals T = Ti, Zr, or Hf. This imbalances the electron count and results in layered metals characterized by relatively high carrier mobilities and bulk two-dimensional Fermi surfaces whose topography is well-described by first principles calculations. Intriguingly, slab electronic structure calculations predict Dirac-like surface states. In contrast to Bi_ 2 Se_ 3, where the surface Dirac bands are at the Γ-point, for (Zr,Hf) _ 2 Te_ 2 (P,As) there are Dirac cones of strong topological character around both the Γ̅- and M̅-points which are above and below the Fermi energy, respectively. For Ti_ 2 Te_ 2 P the surface state is predicted to exist only around the M̅-point. In agreement with these predictions, the surface states that are located below the Fermi energy are observed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, revealing that they coexist with the bulk metallic state. Thus, this family of materials provides a foundation upon which to develop novel phenomena that exploit both the bulk and surface states (e. g., topological superconductivity) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the crystal growth, crystal structure, and basic electrical properties of Bi 2 Te 1. 6 S 1. 4, which incorporates both S and Te in its <b>Tetradymite</b> quintuple layers in the motif -[Te 0. 8 S 0. 2]-Bi-S-Bi-[Te 0. 8 S 0. 2]-. This material differs from other Tetradymites studied as topological insulators {{due to the}} increased ionic character that arises from its significant S content. Bi 2 Te 1. 6 S 1. 4 forms high quality crystals from the melt and is the S-rich limit of the ternary Bi-Te-S γ-Tetradymite phase at the melting point. The native material is n-type with a low resistivity; Sb substitution, with adjustment of the Te to S ratio, results in a crossover to p-type and resistive behavior at low temperatures. Angle resolved photoemission study shows that topological surface states are present, with the Dirac point more exposed {{than it is in}} Bi 2 Te 3 and similar to that seen in Bi 2 Te 2 Se. Single crystal structure determination indicates that the S in the outer chalcogen layers is closer to the Bi than the Te, and therefore that the layers supporting the surface states are corrugated on the atomic scale.

30|$|Antimony {{telluride}} (Sb 2 Te 3) is a narrow-band-gap (approximately 0.2  eV) semiconductor with a <b>tetradymite</b> {{structure and}} {{has been shown to}} be one of the most promising TE materials at room temperature [19]. Das et al. have studied the TE and electrical properties of crystalline Sb 2 Te 3 thin films as a function of temperature and film thickness, including thermal power, the Seebeck coefficient, and electric resistivity [15]. They have reported that both the TE power and electrical resistivity are linear functions of the reciprocal of the film thickness. Furthermore, while many previous works have primarily examined the electrical properties and power factor of Sb 2 Te 3, including the Seebeck coefficient [15, 20 - 22], only a small number of works on the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of Sb 2 Te 3 thin films have been reported, despite the fact that this substance has been proven to be an excellent TE material. Moreover, the effects of the nanostructures and morphologies of Sb 2 Te 3 thin films, including the strain and grain size, on the temperature-dependent thermal transport are also important with regard to further understanding of the thermal properties of these films. This is especially true since grain size and strain may play a significant role in thermal transport [23]. For example, it has been reported that the effects of strain in TE materials enhance the thermal performance, since the thermal conductivity increases as the compressive strain increases, while it decreases with increasing tensile strain [24, 25].|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a {{detailed study of}} the structural, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of single-crystal, n-type, Mn-doped Bi 2 Te 3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. With increasing Mn concentration, the crystal structure changes from the <b>tetradymite</b> structure of the Bi 2 Te 3 parent crystal at low Mn concentrations towards a BiTe phase in the (Bi 2 Te 3) m(Bi 2) n homologous series. Magnetization measurements reveal the onset of ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature in the range 13. 8 K - 17 K in films with 2 % - 10 % Mn concentration. Magnetization hysteresis loops reveal that the magnetic easy axis is along the c-axis of the crystal (perpendicular to the plane). Polarized neutron reflectivity measurements of a 68 nm-thick sample show that the magnetization is uniform through the film. The presence of ferromagnetism is also manifest in a strong anomalous Hall effect and a hysteretic magnetoresistance arising from domain wall scattering. Ordinary Hall effect measurements show that the carrier density is n-type, increases with Mn doping, and is high enough (> 2. 8 x 10 ^{ 13 } cm^{- 2 }) to place the chemical potential in the conduction band. Thus, the observed ferromagnetism is likely associated with both bulk and surface states. Surprisingly, the Curie temperature does not show any clear dependence on the carrier density but does increase with Mn concentration. Our {{results suggest that the}} ferromagnetism probed in these Mn-doped Bi 2 Te 3 films is not mediated by carriers in the conduction band or in an impurity band...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of electrons}} in crystals underpins {{the technology that}} defines our modern-day information society. Confining electrons to only two or even a single dimension leads to unexpected and strange behaviour, whose understanding and control is an active field of physics. In this thesis, data from direct experimental probes of the behaviour of electrons in 1 D metallic nanowire systems and 2 D states at the surface of 3 D topological insulators (TIs) are discussed. In both these systems, the interesting physics {{takes place at the}} interface - for the nanowires the boundary between the substrate and deposited metal adatoms; for the TIs the surface dividing the topologically non-trivial bulk and the topologically trivial world outside the crystal. The Au/Ge(110) and Au/Ge(100) nanowire systems were studied. The former is new, and our experiments show the surface electronic surface to be 2 D, not 1 D. The well-known Au/Ge(100) system has been proposed to harbour Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid-like 1 D states at the surface, yet our comprehensive combination of ARPES, STM/S and theory shows that although the relevant electronic states are interestingly incoherent, they are 2 D, not 1 D. The second focus is on the <b>tetradymite</b> family of 3 D TIs. The topological surface states of these materials are discussed as candidates for future spintronics technologies. Detailed investigations of the surface electronic structure of these materials are presented and numerous control pathways over the electronic band structure at the surface are highlighted, such as using illumination to tune the binding energy of the Dirac point, removing unwanted bulk bands...|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} Pb-rich baksanite was {{recovered}} in a magnetite–andradite skarn from the Tyrnyauz W–Mo deposit, {{in the northern}} Caucasus, Baksan River valley, Kabardino–Balkaria Republic, Russian Federation. The rock sample forms part of the historical mineralogical collection of the Natural History Museum of the University of Florence. Associated minerals are bismuthinite, <b>tetradymite,</b> joséite-A and ingodite; gangue minerals are calcite and andradite. Electron-microprobe analyses gave the chemical formula (Bi 4. 94 Pb 0. 96) 5. 90 (Te 2. 03 S 3. 06). The mineral occurs as anhedral grains up to 0. 5 mm across. Plumbian baksanite is dark steel-grey, shows a black streak, and has a perfect basal cleavage. Its calculated density (for Z = 3) is 7. 44 g/cm 3 for the empirical formula and 7. 51 g/cm 3 inferred for (Bi 5 Pb) (Te 2 S 3). The mineral is greyish white in reflected light, weakly bireflectant, nonpleochroic, faintly anisotropic in yellowish gray tints. Reflectivity values (Rmin and Rmax in %) are 47. 2, 50. 3 (471. 1 nm), 47. 9, 50. 7 (548. 3 nm), 48. 2, 51. 3 (586. 6 nm), and 48. 5, 51. 4 (652. 3 nm), respectively.
