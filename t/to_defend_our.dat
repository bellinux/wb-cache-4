In late 1982 its B-52D models were retired and it received B-52H models from the inactivating 37th Bombardment Squadron at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. With the B-52H's it stood on nuclear alert. Its B-52H bombers were on nuclear alert during Operation Desert Shield in 1991 and the squadron was not used in combat operations.|$|E
25|$|The Poles {{had already}} {{suffered}} from discrimination and numerous oppressive measures in Germany long before unification. These measures were intensified after the German Empire was formed and Bismarck {{was known to}} be particularly hostile towards the Poles. Christopher Clark argues that Prussian policy changed radically in the 1870s in the face of highly visible Polish support for France in the Franco-Prussian war. Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army — though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>our</b> national interests and our language against such hostile actions. Therefore, in the Province of Posen the Kulturkampf took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany.|$|E

500|$|Lumumba's stance {{appeared}} to many Belgians {{to justify their}} prior concerns about his radicalism. On 9 July, Belgium deployed paratroopers, without the Congolese state's permission, in Kabalo and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians. The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation, Lumumba denounced it and called for [...] "all Congolese <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>our</b> republic against those who menace it." [...] At Lumumba's request, white civilians from {{the port city of}} Matadi were evacuated by the Belgian Navy on 11 July. Belgian ships then bombarded the city; at least 19 civilians were killed. This action prompted renewed attacks on whites across the country, while Belgian forces entered other towns and cities, including Léopoldville, and clashed with Congolese troops.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{previous}} claims, Clinkscales re-signed with the Hurricanes for the 2016–17 season on October 18, 2016, having been persuaded {{to make the}} decision by newly hired head coach Kevin Keathley. Clinkscales said, [...] "I am very excited to be returning to Halifax. I love the city and all of our supporters. I'm ready to work hard and build a team <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>our</b> title with Coach Keathley. Da General is back!" [...] However, Keathley was replaced by Mike Leslie by the start of the season. On December 26, in his season debut, Clinkscales scored six points, grabbed five rebounds, and passed for a team-high five assists to defeat the Moncton Miracles. He had another notable performance on January 12, 2017 vs. the Island Storm, scoring no points but recording 13 assists.|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall.

After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens {{who have come to}} take our jobs... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>our</b> borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep.

I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
