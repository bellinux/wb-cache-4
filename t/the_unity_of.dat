5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> God, <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> religion, and <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science proved <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> all {{man because}} all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., {{all members of}} a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> God's will, and he clearly believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E

5|$|The Swastika Flag {{was to be}} used as {{a symbol}} to {{represent}} not only the National Socialist movement, but also <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the Nordic-Germanic peoples into a single state.

5|$|For years Peckham {{taught at}} Paris, {{where he was}} in contact {{with many of the}} leading {{scholars}} of his time, including Thomas Aquinas. He famously debated Aquinas on at least two occasions during 1269 and 1270, during which Peckham defended the conservative theological position, and Thomas put forth his views on the soul. The Thomist doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} Democrat {{who saw the}} abolitionist movement as a fundamental threat to <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South {{setting the stage for}} Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the West Indies team itself.|$|E

5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians.

The Russian government maintains that the anthem is a symbol of <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the people, and that it respects the past. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic {{nationalism}} {{inspire the}} Croatian National Revival, {{a political and}} cultural campaign advocating <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> all South Slavs in the empire.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians, Ban Josip Jelačić helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849, and ushering a period of Germanization policy.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Movement uses symbols to {{represent}} the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, {{better known as the}} Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Australia and Europe). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had {{at least one of them}} on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} met in Limoges {{and then}} withdrew to Poitiers and Bordeaux, {{but as the}} French military situation deteriorated, became split over what should happen. The government was split between those who supported staying in France or staying with the French government and those who supported withdrawing to the United Kingdom. Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E

According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising {{the lessons of the}} past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E
