50|$|The I-Beam was {{a popular}} nightclub in San Francisco that was located in the Haight-Ashbury {{neighborhood}} at 1748 Haight Street. Before opening the club, Sanford Kellman had an impromptu party there and found that all the neighbors complained about the noise. Therefore, Sanford Kellman was required by the City government of San Francisco <b>to</b> <b>soundproof</b> the entire building at great expense, delaying {{the opening of the}} club for several months. On the opening night of the club in October 1977, groups of bare-chested men in jeans and construction hats carried I-Beams on their shoulders into the club.|$|E
50|$|At 8pm on 26 August 2014, Newport's Le Pub venue, {{which is}} facing closure, {{announced}} via Twitter that Jarcrew would be reforming for a one-off show supporting 'Mclusky' (mclusky's Andrew Falkous and Jack Egglestone, with Million Dead/Future of the Left bassist Julia Ruzicka {{filling in for}} original bassist Jon Chapple) on Saturday 8 November. All proceeds generated from ticket sales would go towards the £10,000 goal which would pay <b>to</b> <b>soundproof</b> the venue and keep it in business. Mclusky and Jarcrew performed again a week later in Cardiff's Clwb Ifor Bach, for the same cause. They have since performed sporadic one-off shows around Cardiff.|$|E

According to The Daily Telegraph, the minister claimed a total of £86,277 over four years in additional costs allowance - close to the total allowed under Parliament's green book. In the June 2009 reshuffle Winterton was moved to Minister of State for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government and in that role was invited to attend cabinet when her responsibility was on the agenda.|$|E
50|$|JW Farquhar {{recorded}} his debut album, The Formal Female, following {{the end of}} his 10-year marriage in 1972. Having little money for gear following the divorce, JW Farquhar recorded the album in response to his ex-wife, using a TEAC 4-track and playing all the instruments, including a primitive drum machine. The recording took place in his apartment in Philadelphia. Due to the presence of various background sounds surrounding his third floor apartment including sirens, buses, and gunshots, Farquar tried <b>to</b> <b>soundproof</b> his apartment by covering the windows with foam, receiving mixed results. The album was released on Brainblobru Records in 1973 with a private pressing and was reissued in 2008 through Shadoks Records.|$|E

But when I got back, everything was too far gone to fix, so there was fallout. Losing my place the Navy Yards was a big deal. It’s a big space, and over the years I acquired a decent amount of gear. New York is a beast, man, it’s hard {{to find a place to}} do music unless you’re going <b>to</b> <b>soundproof</b> it. Relationships are tough when youre on the road, too - my girlfriend would come on some of the tours, but it wasnt easy. Drugs and booze were involved. So I lost the place, lost the girl, and lost my mind." ...|$|E

50|$|DAF's 95 {{series was}} {{launched}} in 1987, and quickly gained the coveted 'Truck of The Year' award. The 95 featured an all new cab developed jointly with ENASA of Spain, a revised version of the 11.6 litre ATI engine, rated at 310, 350, and 380 Bhp, and 16 speed ZF gearbox. On the Continent Eaton's Twinsplitter gearbox was an option. A full range of axle configurations were offered, to suit every operating requirement. Much attention was paid <b>to</b> <b>soundproofing</b> - the gearlinkage for example was telescopic - in-cab noise levels on the 95 put many luxury saloons to shame. An update in 1991 saw new power ratings of 329, 364, and 401 Bhp, - a 430 Bhp variant, along with low deck tractor unit models and revised interior trim, were introduced in Spring 1992.|$|R

50|$|On 18 January 2012, the Federal Railway Authority {{asked the}} Tübingen region {{to conduct an}} {{additional}} consultation process on further changes to the plans. These changes include {{the elimination of the}} originally planned fifth platform in the station, the elimination of Ulm Ost station and modifications <b>to</b> <b>soundproofing</b> and waste water technology. Deutsche Bahn justified the omission of the fifth platform with operational improvements {{as a result of the}} concentration of all train parking in a new vehicle maintenance facility and sidings. The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure doubted whether the platform could actually be eliminated if long-term service improvements (including the planned Danube-Iller Regional S-Bahn) are to be implemented. A critic sees the S-Bahn concept compromised if the fifth platform is not provided from the outset. If a fifth platform is actually necessary, according to the DB, funding would have to be provided for separately. The DB is not aware of formal plans for an S-Bahn.|$|R

5000|$|As Gibson gained {{experience}} {{and created a}} reputation for clean, artful sound engineering in Vermont, he started working with big name artists from across the country. Some of the more well known artists to work with Gibson are: The Vermont Symphony Orchestra, The Vermont Jazz Ensemble, Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Kento Masuda, and Elizabeth Von Trapp. In 2009, Gibson assumed control of the Carpenter Farm Studio in Charlotte, Vermont and officially founded Lane Gibson Recording and Mastering. The Carpenter Farm building is a classic Vermont farmhouse with one big difference...the house has a custom designed recording studio attached to it. From the foundation to the finishing touches, the studio itself was designed {{for the purpose of}} creating and recording music. From double walls, windows and doors <b>to</b> <b>soundproofing,</b> the Carpenter Farm is now Lane Gibson's recording studio, and was described by the API industry blog as being, [...] "made up of spacious yet intimate rooms to enable smooth workflow". Gibson finds the natural beauty of the state, as well as the lack of background interference to be crucial to the success of his clients.|$|R

40|$|The {{shooting}} noise {{caused by}} shooting training, which has strength and impacts, {{is becoming a}} seri-ous damage to the residents around the shooting range and, consequently, the number of civil appeals against the shooting noise is on the constant increase. For this reason, the military examines the ef-fects of the shooting noise at the stage of design in constructing a shooting range and tries <b>to</b> build a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range <b>to</b> minimize civil appeals. However, the lack of research and data concern-ing propagation and attenuation, both of which characterize the shooting noise from within a sound-proof shooting range, even makes it so difficult <b>to</b> design a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range in constructing it. So this study used an acoustic simulation in a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range <b>to</b> identify acoustic and propagation characteristics within the shooting range and, on this basis, predicted the noise level at an exit of the soundproof shooting range. As a result, if the form and specifications of a soundproof shooting range were decided on at the stage of design, {{it was possible to}} use a simulation <b>to</b> design a <b>soundproof</b> shooting range with optimized acoustic performance and, on this basis, to predict a sound pressure level at an exit of the soundproof shooting range.

The Mansion building had to be safely supported during all phases of the work, especially during excavation of the 10m deep basement. This excavation was the critical activity that could result in damage to the Mansion.The retention of a heritage building on this commercial site imposed financial penalties on the development as well as physical constraints. If the Mansion was ever to remain a nightclub it would need <b>to</b> be <b>soundproofed</b> if the venue was to comply with zoning rules and noise emission restraints.|$|R
50|$|Recording {{studios are}} {{carefully}} designed around {{the principles of}} room acoustics to create a set of spaces with the acoustical properties required for recording sound with precision and accuracy. This will consist of both room treatment (through the use of absorption and diffusion materials on the surfaces of the room, and also consideration of the physical dimensions of the room itself {{in order to make}} the room respond to sound in a desired way) and <b>soundproofing</b> (also <b>to</b> provide sonic isolation between the rooms) to prevent sound from leaving the property. A recording studio has <b>to</b> be <b>soundproofed</b> on its outer shell as well, to prevent noises from the surrounding streets and roads from being picked up by microphones.|$|R
