5|$|Association with Koren – in America, Speyer was {{friendly}} with John Koren, an American statistician {{who represented the}} United States on the International Prisons Commission. In 1916, Speyer had funded a fact-finding <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> Koren to Europe, during which Koren visited Germany and met Speyer's sister and friends. Although the committee considered the trip strange, they drew no inference of disloyalty from the events.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams made the <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following {{the intervention of}} newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
40|$|The DTS {{is aimed}} at {{addressing}} the need to collect more detailed information on domestic tourism {{in order to better}} understand and measure the contribution of the tourism industry towards the national economy. This will be done by collecting accurate statistics on the travel behaviour and expenditure of South African residents travelling within and outside the borders of South Africa. Such information is crucial in determining the contribution of tourism to the South African economy as well as helping with planning, marketing, policy formulation and regulation of tourism-related activities. In addition to the basic demographic information collected in the majority of household surveys conducted by Stats SA, the DTS covers seven areas specifically related to travel and expenditure patterns, namely: overview of <b>trips</b> taken <b>by</b> the household, domestic day <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> the respondent and/or other household members, domestic day <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> other household members only (without the respondent), domestic overnight <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> the respondent and/or other household members, domestic overnight <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> other household members only (without the respondent), foreign overnight <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> the respondent and/or other household members, and foreign overnight <b>trips</b> <b>by</b> other household members only (without the respondent) ...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

During the 1910 Championship of Australia match against Victorian Football League (VFL) premiers Collingwood Harold Oliver kicked 5 goals helping Port Adelaide achieve the win. In 1910 Oliver {{also made the}} journey with Port Adelaide to Western Australia to play a series of matches. This was the first <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> an eastern state club to play {{football}} in Western Australia. Harold Oliver was awarded a gold medal by Port Adelaide for being the best junior of the 1910 season for the club.|$|E

5|$|In 1792, Lieutenant William Broughton, a British explorer, led {{the first}} <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> non-natives as far up the Columbia River as {{the mouth of}} the Sandy River. He and his men camped on Sauvie Island, which lies between the Willamette and Columbia rivers {{directly}} opposite {{the mouth of the}} slough. Broughton encountered many Chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including Hayden Island and other islands in the Columbia just north of the slough. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800people living in 11villages. The explorers estimated that 800people of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookans lived in five villages on Sauvie Island.|$|E
5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on some issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass. Other than the <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valparaíso, where letters {{informed}} Roger {{that his}} father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May. In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, John Moore. In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago. Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where he took a long hunting <b>trip.</b> <b>By</b> the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where he wrote to his aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico. The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship, the Bella, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.|$|E

5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
5|$|The first World Cup was {{the only}} one without qualification. Every country {{affiliated}} with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances, and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929. Two months {{before the start of the}} tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art {{full-time}} under Kenneth Hayes Miller and Kimon Nicolaides at the Art Students League. Nevelson credited {{an exhibition}} of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{as a catalyst for}} her to study art further. In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the <b>trip</b> <b>by</b> selling a diamond bracelet that her now ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike's birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann, who was serving as a guest instructor at the Art Students League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance. She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art that made her famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same fluidity seen in the works of Henri Matisse. Nevelson also created terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.|$|E
