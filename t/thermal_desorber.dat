50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ remedial technology that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. <b>Thermal</b> <b>desorbers</b> are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, <b>thermal</b> <b>desorbers</b> can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an afterburner, catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{temperature}} {{is a key}} parameter affecting the degree of treatment of organic components. The required treatment temperature depends upon the specific types of petroleum contamination in the soil.

A <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> removing 500 mg/kg of organic contaminants from 20,000 tons of soil will produce less than 3,000 gallons of liquid organic.

40|$|Nonthermal plasma (NTP) {{technology}} is a promising candidate {{for the treatment of}} air pollutants. An NTP is different from a thermal plasma in that high energy electrons are used to create chemically active species without raising the gas to high temperatures. NTPs have the potential of simultaneous removal of multiple air pollutants with better control over treatment byproducts. A silent discharge plasma (SDP) configuration is one method of easily generating such a nonthermal plasma. Silent electrical discharge plasma (dielectric barrier) reactors can decompose gas-phase pollutants by free-radical attack or electron-induced fragmentation. The radicals or electrons are produced by the large average volume nonthermal plasmas generated in the reactor. In the past decade, the barrier configuration has attracted attention for destroying toxic chemical agents for the military, removing harmful greenhouse gases (oxides of sulfur and nitrogen - SO{sub x} and NO{sub x}), and treating other environmentally-hazardous chemical compounds (hydrocarbons, chlorocarbons, and chlorofluorocarbons). At the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the authors have been studying the silent discharge plasma for processing gaseous-based hazardous chemicals for approximately five years. The key objective is to convert hazardous or toxic chemicals into non-hazardous compounds or into materials which are more easily managed. The main applications have been for treating off-gases from thermal treatment units (e. g., incinerators, high-temperature packed bed reactors, arc melters; low-temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>desorbers),</b> and for abating hazardous air-pollutant emissions (e. g., industrial air emissions, vapors extracted from contaminated soil or groundwater) ...|$|R

Most thermal screw systems circulate a hot heat-transfer oil through the hollow flights of the auger and return the hot oil through the shaft to the heat transfer fluid heating system. The heated oil is also circulated through the jacketed trough in which each auger rotates. Thermal screws can also be steam-heated.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of a miniaturized thermally activated cooling system was conducted. This study represents the first work to conceptualize, design, fabricate and successfully test a thermally activated cooling system for mobile applications. Thermally activated systems {{have the ability to}} produce useful cooling from waste heat streams or directly from the combustion of liquid fuels. Numerous concepts of miniaturized or mobile, active cooling systems exist in the literature but up to this point, successful fabrication and testing has not been documented. 	During this study, a breadboard absorption heat pump system was fabricated from off the shelf or in-house, custom-built components. The breadboard system was used to validate the feasibility of operating an absorption heat pump with a cooling capacity of about 300 W. Subsequently, a flexible and scalable design methodology for designing miniaturized absorption heat pumps was developed. A miniaturized, 300 W nominal cooling capacity ammonia/water absorption heat pump cycle with overall dimensions of 200 × 200 × 34 mm and a mass of 7 kg was then fabricated and tested. 	Testing of the absorption heat pump was conducted over a range of heat sink temperatures (20 ≤ T ≤ 35 °C) and <b>desorber</b> <b>thermal</b> input rates (500 ≤ Q ≤ 800 W). Evaporator coolant heat duties in the study ranged from 136 to 300 W, while system COPs ranged from 0. 247 to 0. 434. At a nominal rating condition of 35 °C heat sink temperature, the maximum thermal input of 800 W produced a cooling effect of 230 W. This represents a cycle COP of 0. 29. Analysis of the experimental data indicated that future work should focus on improved desorber and rectifier designs to improve refrigerant purity. It is estimated that a system similar to the one in this study, with all fluid connections made internal to the system, could achieve the same cooling capacity with a system mass of 2. 5 - 3. 5 kg in an envelop of 120 × 120 × 25 mm.

40|$|We have {{continued}} experiments on {{the reaction of}} iodate with sphagnum peat moss. We have established that iodate added to a suspension of peat moss undergoes reduction and to a significant extent is incorporated in to the peat moss. We have confirmed the incorporation of iodine into the peat matrix using pyrolysis GC/MS. In addition, we have performed a scaled up pyrolysis using the preparative GC system that was described in a previous report. This instrument consisted of a packed column gas chromatograph (SRI 8010) with a TCD detector and injector valve equipped with a <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber.</b> Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a 6 ” tube furnace manufactured by Carbolyte. This programmable furnace has a 0. 5 ” diameter process tube that can hold 8 - 100 mg samples of peat or ion exchange resin. During sample heating helium stream sweeps products from the tube furnace to the carbosieve trap located in the <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> unit. Volatile materials that are collected on the carbosieve trap can {{be transferred to the}} gas chromatograph by actuating the valve and activating the thermal desorption oven. Chromatography is initiated by thermally desorbing trapped volatiles from the carbosieve trap to the GC column (2 mm x 2 m, Porapak Q). The instrument was calibrated with by injecting methyl iodide into the <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> trap. The response factor and retention time of methyl iodide were thus determined. Pyrolysis experiments with 8 - 12 mg of organic matter have been conducted using this experimental apparatus. Experimental results for a two series of incubations are shown in Figure 1. Results for experiments with a peat sample incubated at 40 oC and pH 4. 3 are shown. In addition, the results for a commercially available humic acid at pH 2 are presented. The low pH was used to prevent dissolution of the humic material. During this last quarter we have investigated the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the yield of methyl iodide. We have done experiments with the analytical pyrolysis unit described in previous reports and with the preparative GC. The results of these studies are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 and demonstrate optimum methyl iodide production at 400 oC. The peat (350 mg) was incubated in 20 mL of 2. 7 * 10 - 3 M KIO 3. The suspension pH was established with phosphate buffer and the sample was held in a constant temperature incubator. In most cases the amount of methyl iodide produced by pyrolysis increased with an increase in heating time.

40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to {{validate}} a method for the determination of VOCs in human breath sample. These compounds {{can be associated with}} a physiologic imbalance of the body that can lead to an oxidative stress, which is an alteration in the concentration of oxidant agent inside the organism. This disease can manifest with an exceed of species like peroxides and free radicals, which can cause grave illness like arteriosclerosis, Parkinson syndrome, pulmonary embolism and so on. The main problem in the analysis of VOCs is their instability. The proposed solution is to use a derivatization agent in order to form stable adduct of those analytes, and then analyze them with chromatographic technique. The innovation in this technique lie {{in the fact that the}} derivatization agent is applied directly on the sampler device, specifically Thermal Desorption Tubes. Using a loading device the sample is passed through the stationary phase, while other data like flow rate and CO 2 concentration can still be recorded. The sample are then analyzed with gas chromatographic technique, using a <b>Thermal</b> <b>Desorber</b> in order to release the compounds. Thanks to the Mass Spectrometer coupled with the <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> it is possible to both identificate and quantificate the species. A possible application for this method, is the develop of an instrument for the monitoring of the breath of patient at risk of pulmonary embolism, like for example person subject to deep vein thrombosis at their leg, people that has been operated recently or that are frequently subject to traumas. With the variation of the haematocrit, these categories can develop a blood clot in the vein that, if it’s small enough, can pass through the hearth wall and cause a pulmonary embolism. A second application of this method would be the monitoring of preterm newborn, subject to Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, a grave disease that hit almost exclusively infants born ahead of time.

Beer aroma profiles {{can be used for}} the fingerprinting of specific beer brands or for trouble shooting purposes such as the identification of off-flavours. The multichannel silicone rubber trap (MCT) lends itself perfectly to this task. The simplicity and robustness of the MCT makes it ideal for concentrating the volatile compounds that constitute the aroma of an alcoholic beverage such as beer. The retention of these substances by the silicone is based on dissolution into the polymer. This gives more intrinsic stability to the concentrated aroma compounds than traditionally used, adsorption based methods, so transport of the trap and contents should not be a problem. Thermal desorption is used to introduce the trapped aroma compounds to the chromatographic instrument. This eliminates the need for high purity solvents and greatly reduces the sample preparation time.

Thermal desorption of solid environmental sample provides a technique for liberation of volatile analytes from the samples without the need for solvent extraction. Combining the thermal desorption technique with a field gas chromatograph (GC) thus provides the possibility of on-site determination of organic contaminants in soils.

The combination of these two factors may lead up to situations with great potential of flammability, which provoke high risk for the firefighters. No less 9 cases were reported for 15 years ago in France with 16 fatalities for the firefighters. The hypothesis of our works comes from the simple fact of back experiences.

There {{is a need for}} real-time, continuous measurements of organic contaminants in representative cleanroom environment especially in lithography zone. Such information is essential to properly evaluate the impact of organic contamination on optical lenses. In this study, a Proton-Transfer Reaction-Time-of-Flight Mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) was applied for real-time and continuous monitoring of fugitive organic contamination induced by the fabrication process. Three types of measurements were carried out using the PTR-TOF-MS in order to detect the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) next to the tools in the photolithography area and at the upstream and downstream of chemical filters used to purge the air in the cleanroom environment. A validation and verification of the results obtained with PTR-TOF-MS was performed by comparing these results with those obtained with an off-line technique that is Automated <b>Thermal</b> <b>Desorber</b> - Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS) used as a reference analytical method. The emerged results from the PTR-TOF-MS analysis exhibited the temporal variation of the VOCs levels in the cleanroom environment during the fabrication process.

Regarding TMS, a significant difference was observed ascribed to the technical performance of both instruments...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of micropollutants in the aquatic environment is a worldwide environmental concern. The diversity of micropollutants {{and the low}} concentration levels at which they may occur in the aquatic environment have greatly complicated the analysis and detection of these chemicals. Two sorptive extraction samplers and two thermal desorption methods {{for the detection of}} micropollutants in water were compared. A low-cost, disposable, in-house made sorptive extraction sampler was compared to SBSE using a commercial Twister sorptive sampler. Both samplers consisted of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a sorptive medium to concentrate micropollutants. Direct thermal desorption of the disposable samplers in the inlet of a GC was compared to conventional thermal desorption using a commercial <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> system (TDS). Comprehensive gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) was used for compound separation and identification. Ten micropollutants, representing a range of heterogeneous compounds, were selected to evaluate the performance of the methods. The in-house constructed sampler, with its associated benefits of low-cost and disposability, gave results comparable to commercial SBSE. Direct thermal desorption of the disposable sampler in the inlet of a GC eliminated the need for expensive consumable cryogenics and total analysis time was greatly reduced as a lengthy desorption temperature programme was not required. Limits of detection for the methods ranged from 0. 0010 ng L− 1 to 0. 19 ng L− 1. For most compounds, the mean (n = 3) recoveries ranged from 85 % to 129 % and the % relative standard deviation (% RSD) ranged from 1 % to 58 % with the majority of the analytes having a % RSD of less than 30 %. The National Research Foundation (NRF) [URL]...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study is {{conducted on the}} emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by Rosmarinus officinalis plants when exposed to an external radiant flux. The thermal radiation heats the plant and causes the emission of VOCs. The thermal radiation simulates the radiant flux received by vegetation in a forest fire. The results of the experiments are used in a simplified analysis {{to determine if the}} emissions of VOCs in an actual forest fire situation could produce a flammable gas mixture and potentially lead to the onset of an accelerating forest fire. The experiments consist of placing a plant in a hermetic enclosure and heating it with a radiant panel. The VOCs produced are collected and analyzed with an automatic <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> coupled with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (ATD-GC/MS). The effects of the fire intensity (radiant panel heat flux) and the fire retardant on the VOCs emission are then investigated. Two thresholds of the VOCs emission are observed. The first is for plant temperatures of around 120 C and appears to be caused by the evaporation of the water in the plant, which carries with it a certain amount of VOCs. The second one is around 175 C, which is due to the vaporization of the major parts of VOCs. The application of a fire retardant increases the emission of VOCs due to the presence of the water (80 %) in the fire retardant. However, the use of the retardant results in a lower production of VOCs than using water alone. The measurements are used to estimate the concentration of VOCs potentially produced during the propagation of a specific fire and compared to the flammability limits of a-pinene. It is concluded that the quantities of VOCs emitted by Rosmarinus officinalis shrubs under certain fire conditions are capable of creating an accelerating forest fir...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCertain Mediterranean plants (e. g. Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus, Pinus halepensis) {{produce and}} emit {{volatile}} substances {{related to their}} secondary metabolism, [1, 2]. The composition of these substances is flammable. The assumption is that these emitted compounds are found in concentrations close to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) at periods when the plants are themselves highly flammable. To obtain this critical situation, {{it is necessary that}} these chemical products can accumulate in certain geographical zones (e. g. small valleys, thalweg). The conjugation of these two effects (accumulation and flammability) is capable of causing situations with high potential of ignition, and consequently a strong risk for the fire-fighters. There exist few studies on the implication of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in the phenomenon of blow-up in wildland fires, [3, 4], contrary to their impact as precursor of ozone, [5, 6]. In France, over the last 15 years one counts eleven cases of blow-up in wildland fires involved the death of thirteen fire-fighters, [7]. Similar accidents occurred in Portugal, [8, 9], and in the United States, [10]. The aim of the present work is to characterise the emission of the VOC responsible for the phenomenon of blow-up in wildland fires on a representative vegetation of the Mediterranean basin such as Rosmarinus officinalis. In this study we simulate the fire intensity by a radiant panel in order to measure the impact of thermal radiation and to evaluate the effect of the fire retardant on the VOC emissions. For that, an original experimental protocol which consists in placing a plant in a hermetic enclosure and to heat it by a radiant panel has been developed, cf. Figure 1. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the VOC is carried out with an Automatic <b>Thermal</b> <b>Desorber</b> coupled with a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (ATD-GC-MS) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{organochlorine}} insecticide DDT (1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane) is still used for malaria vector control {{in certain areas}} of South Africa. The strict Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) allows spraying {{on the inside of}} traditional dwellings with DDT. In rural villages contaminated dust presents an additional pathway for exposure to DDT. We present a new method for the determination of DDT in indoor air where separate vapour and particulate samples are collected in a single step with a denuder configuration of a multi-channel open tubular silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) trap combined with a micro quartz fibre filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap section of the denuder concentrates vapour phase insecticide whereas particle associated insecticide is transferred downstream where it is collected on a micro-fibre filter followed by a second multi-channel PDMS trap to capture the blow-off from the filter. The multi-channel PDMS trap and filter combination are designed to fit a commercial <b>thermal</b> <b>desorber</b> for direct introduction of samples into a GC-MS. The technique is 2 solvent-free. Analyte extraction and sample clean-up is not required. Two fractions, vapour phase and particulate phase p,p’-DDT, o,p’-DDT; p,p’-DDD, o,p’-DDD; p,p’-DDE and o,p’-DDE in 4 L contaminated indoor air, were each quantitatively analysed by GC-MS using isotopically labeled ring substituted 13 C 12 – p,p’-DDT as an internal standard. Limits of detection were 0. 07 - 0. 35 ng m- 3 for p,p’-DDT, o,p’-DDT, p,p’-DDD, o,p’-DDD, p,p’-DDE and o,p’-DDE. Ratios of airborne p,p’-DDD/p,p’-DDT and of o,p’-DDT/p,p’-DDT are unusual and do not match the ideal certified ingredient composition required of commercial DDT. Results suggest that the DDT products used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) prior to, and during 2007, may have been compromised with regards to insecticidal efficacy, demonstrating the power of this new environmental forensics tool...|$|E
40|$|Sesquiterpenes {{compounds}} {{are well}} known biogenic volatile organic compounds. They play important roles in atmospheric process since they are reactive and have high yields {{in the formation of}} secondary organic aerosol which in turn, reduces visibility by scattering the light, becomes cloud condensation nuclei and affects the radiation balance, and impairs human health because of its toxicity. There has no report on the sesquiterpenes (SQT) contribution to the atmosphere from ambient fungal species. Quantitative and qualitative characterization of SQT is essentially needed for a better understanding and assessment on the role of ambient fungi as natural or biological source of SQT. Six common airborne fungi (Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium Chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. (A), Penicillium sp. (B) and Trichoderma sp) were selected in this study. They were inoculated in Malt Extract Agar (MEA) plates and incubated in Andersen impactor. Air samples flowing through the fungal culture were collected with Tenax thermal desorption tubes and sesquiterpenes were analyszed with gas chromatograph and mass spectrometric detector coupled with an Automated <b>Thermal</b> <b>Desorber.</b> A total of twenty-four sesquiterpene species were identified. The amount and composition of the sesquiterpene emitted by the model species, Trichoderma sp., was found to be species-, temperature-, RH- and face velocity-dependent. The emission rate also depends on the growth rate. The steady sesquiterpenes emission of Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Trichoderma sp, Penicillium Chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. (A) and Penicillium sp. (B) were determined as 1. 09 μg, 0. 36 μg, 2. 22 μg, 0. 63 μg, 1. 00 μg and 1. 2021 μg per day, respectively. The emission rate is comparable with one fifth to one tenth of reported vegetation emission. Fungi can thus be a high potential sesquiterpene emission source...|$|E
