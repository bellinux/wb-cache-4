40|$|Background/Aim. Today {{there are}} controversies about {{searching for the}} ideal {{surgical}} method (conservatively with plaster cast, with open and percutaneous <b>tenorrhaphy)</b> for repairing a ruptured Achilles tendon. The {{aim of this study}} {{study was to examine the}} results of treating Achilles tendon ruptures in patients by using the following methods: percutaneous suturing, open surgery technique and non-surgical treatment by plaster cast immobilisation. Methods. Forty two patients treated at our facility in the period August 2003 - September 2010 for Achilles tendon ruptures were included in the study. They were operated on by using different orthopedic procedures (percutaneous reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, open surgery, plaster cast only) and two anaesthesia technique (spinal aneasthesia and local infiltrational anaesthesia). The following parameters were monitored after interventions performed and compared: duration of hospital stay, postsurgical complications, incidence of the reruptures of the Achilles tendon and time for full leg functionality. Results. The patients sustained their respective injuries in the following manner: 8 of them while pursuing sports activities, 24 while pursuing recreational activities, 4 at workplace, 4 while performing everyday activities, and 2 of the patients did not know how they had sustained their injuries. The average age of the patients was 40. 5, with 37 (88 %) men and 5 (12 %) women. Surgeries were performed under spinal anaesthesia in 29 (69 %) patients, and in 5 (12 %) patients <b>tenorrhaphy</b> was performed under local anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was not used in 8 (19 %) patients treated with plaster cast. We performed percutaneous reconstruction of the Achilles tendon in 19 (45 %) patients. A total of 14 (33 %) patients were treated under spinal anaesthesia, and 5 (11. 9 %) under local infiltrational anaesthesia with 2 % xylocain. We treated 15 (36 %) patients with open surgery. The patients treated conservatively stayed in hospital on average for up to 5 hours. Those who underwent an percutaneous surgery stayed 2 days and those who underwent an open surgery stayed 9 days. A total of 28 (66 %) patients from the given series experienced no complications. The patients treated with open surgical reconstruction experienced skin complications ranging from inflammatory changes on the skin in 6 (14 %) patients to dehiscence and skin necrosis in 3 (7 %). The 5 (11. 9 %) patients whose ruptured Achilles tendon was treated percutaneously experienced temporary redness and delayed healing of the incision(s) longer than 5 mm. A total of 3 (7 %) patients treated with open surgery and 1 (2 %) patient treated with percutaneous <b>tenorrhaphy</b> had temporary peroneal nerve prolapses. A total of 7 (16. 6 %) patients had reruptures: 4 were treated with plaster cast, 2 underwent open surgery, and 1 was treated percutaneously. Out of the 8 patients who were treated with plaster cast, 4 sustained reruptures and 3 of the 4 had diabetes. Conclusion. Surgical treatment, percutaneous <b>tenorrhaphy,</b> performed in a small operating theatre under local anaesthesia, should be preferred in cases of fresh ruptures of the Achilles tendon...|$|E
30|$|An ideal tendon repair {{would ensure}} a {{sufficient}} breaking force with a minimal deformity in the tendon repair site to allow early passive and active motion {{so as to}} reduce tendon adhesions and improve the functional outcome. In a conventional <b>tenorrhaphy,</b> knots are the weak point of tendon repair, being operator dependent and causing decreased tendon apposition. Increased suture diameter and number of knots increases the force of repair but also the tendon cross-sectional area, causing an increased gliding resistance. To avoid the potential weakness from knots, and to improve the interaction between tendon tissue and suture materials, it is proposed that barbed sutures could be utilized.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{designed}} to carry out an in vivo and in vitro comparative evaluation of three bio-scaffold augmentation devices used for superficial digital flexor <b>tenorrhaphy</b> in donkeys. Twenty-four clinically healthy donkeys were assigned for three treatment trials (n= 8) using one of three bioscaffold materials (glycerolized bovine pericardium xenograft, tendon allograft and allograft with glycerolized by bovine pericardium). In addition, eight clinically healthy donkeys were selected to serve as control. Clinical signs of each animal were scored and the sum of all clinical indexes was calculated at each time point of the experiment. Four donkeys from each group were euthanized at 45 and 90 days postoperatively, respectively, for biomechanical and histopathological evaluation of treated superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT). The failure stress in allograft shielding group significantly increased compared to the corresponding values of the other groups at 45 (62. 7 ± 6. 5 Nmm− 2) and 90 (88. 8 ± 3. 5 Nmm− 2) days postoperatively. The fetlock angle in the allograft shielding group at both 45 (112. 8 °± 4. 4) and 90 (123. 8 °± 1. 1) days postoperatively showed a significant increase (p< 0. 05) relative to the values of the other groups and a significant decrease (p< 0. 05) when compared to normal angle (125 °± 0). However, the histomorphological findings revealed no remarkable changes between the treatment groups. In conclusion, the failure stress, fetlock angle and histomorphological findings may provide useful information about the healing characteristics of SDFT <b>tenorrhaphy.</b> The bio-scaffold augmentation devices, either xenogenic or allogenic, provide good alternative techniques accelerating SDFT healing with minimal adhesions in donkeys...|$|E

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the repair is critical to maintain coaptation of the severed flexor tendon end until healing has advanced sufficiently. In our hospital, we use a modified Savage repair (four-strand Adelaide technique) using 3 – 0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) for acute flexor <b>tenorrhaphy</b> and an active postrepair mobilization protocol. To explain the apparent differences between the theoretical and actual repair strength of a multistrand repair in a single tension test and the reduced strength of a repair subjected to cyclic loading, we compared single and cyclical tensile loading with different suture in vitro configurations of 3 – 0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA; one, two, and four strands) and an ex vivo four-strand repair of freshly divided porcine tendon to calculate the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Mechanical testing was repeated 15 times with both single tensile and cyclical loading for each suture configuration and porcine repair. In the in vitro model, {{the presence of a}} knot in a single strand reduced the UTS by 50 %. The stiffness of a knotted strand was substantially less than the unknotted strand but became identical after cyclical loading. There was no statistical significance of the UTS between single and cyclical loading with different numbers of strands in this model. In the ex vivo four-strand porcine repair model, there was a significant reduction in UTS with cyclical loading, which equated to the number of strands times the strength of the knotted strand. This discrepancy {{can be explained by the}} change in stiffness of the knotted strand after cyclical loading and has important implications for previous studies of suture tendon repair using single tensile loading where the UTS may have been overestimated. We believe that cyclical loading is more representative of physiological loading after acute flexor tendon repair and should be the testing model of choice in suture <b>tenorrhaphy</b> studies. C. E.

30|$|For knotless tendon repair, the {{following}} new technique was used (Fig.  3). The beginning {{is like a}} Kessler technique, but each needle enters the lateral wall of the proximal tendon stump perpendicular to the fibrils before turning 90  ° and exiting the stump. In the distal stump, each needle was advanced parallel to {{the direction of the}} fibrils for a distance of 0.5  cm before exiting the tendon surface. Next, each needle was used to make two transverse passes perpendicular to the direction of the tendon fibrils. Each needle was then reintroduced into the tendon and advanced parallel to the fibrils to traverse the injury site and enter {{the opposite end of the}} tendon for a distance of 0.5  cm before exiting the tendon surface. Again, two transverse passes were made to anchor the suture, and following the second pass, the excess suture and needle were cut off. This process resulted in a knotless repair with four strands crossing the injury site and four transverse passes at each end of the <b>tenorrhaphy.</b>|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{encouraging}} {{results of}} this study, it is acknowledged {{that a number of}} possible limitations and difficulties may exist with respect to the clinical application of this new barbed <b>tenorrhaphy.</b> Firstly, as this new technique was not performed in situ, it has not been possible to assess the ease of suturing in a clinical setting under the constraints of limited exposure, tendon retraction and tension, especially in zone II. Secondly, it has not been possible to assess in vivo factors such as tendon ischemia and healing after repair, edema, and adhesion formation of this new repair. Another critical aspect is that to maintain the integrity of the barbs, no direct handling of the suture is to be performed with fingers or instruments, so if there is a technical error during repair, the suture has to be cut and removed completely, since it is impossible to back up the suture to rethrow a stitch without damaging the barbs. Finally, our biomechanical testing used a linear load to failure, which may not reflect the physiologic conditions as well as cyclic loading models.|$|E

Using White’s (1956) criteria, the results were good or excellent in 76. 5 % of fingers.

40|$|Introduction. Traumatic hand {{amputation}} is a {{very severe}} and rare injury. Replantation and revascularization surgery requires the existence of specialized centres and well-educated teams of microsurgeons. In places {{where there are no}} such specialized centres for this kind of surgery, traumatic hand amputation is a major concern and quite a challenge, and a successfully performed replantation is a great accomplishment. Case Outline. We report a case of a successfully survived replanted hand in a 35 -year-old male patient with unfortunately bad end result of the treatment. The patient with the amputated left hand (disarticulation) had a surgery 4 hours after injury. The urgent surgical procedure required a debridement, the excision of the first row of the carpal bones, external fixation of the wrist, vascular anastomoses, nerve repair, <b>tenorrhaphy,</b> skin sutures and decompression skin incisions. The successful operation did not have a successful post-operative course due to the patient’s psychiatric problems and lack of rehabilitation at the psychiatric institution where the treatment was continued. Conclusion. Successful surgical performance can unfortunately be ruined due to inadequate further treatment course or the wrong selection for such a demanding surgery. The survival of the amputated hand can be achieved surgically, but achieving refunctioning does not always depend on surgery. It also depends on the very patient, his motivation, rehabilitation, {{as well as on the}} proper selection for such a demanding and complex surgical procedure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare two Krackow sutures with a three-loop pulley suture for the reattachment of canine {{gastrocnemius}} tendons, using a tendon avulsion model. Study design: In vitro biomechanical study. Methods: Ten paired gastrocnemius tendons were severed {{at their}} insertions on the calcaneal tuberosity and repaired with either two modified Krackow sutures or a modified three-loop pulley suture. Sutures {{were placed in}} the tendon ends and through diverging bone tunnels in the medial and lateral processes of the calcaneal tuberosity. Tensile loads required to (a) create a 3 -mm gap and (b) induce construct failure were measured. Results: The mean load to achieve a 3 -mm gap was 77. 22 ± 9. 72 and 55. 85 ± 9. 91 N, and to result in construct failure was 106. 88 ± 12. 74 and 80. 86 ± 12. 23 N for the Krackow and three-loop pulley suture patterns, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 001, respectively). Conclusion and clinical relevance: Two Krackow sutures were superior to the three-loop pulley pattern in both resistance to 3 -mm gap formation and load to failure in a canine gastrocnemius avulsion model. The prevention of gap formation is critical for the success of <b>tenorrhaphy.</b> These results indicate that a suture pattern using two Krackow sutures may be clinically superior to the three-loop pulley suture pattern in the repair of canine gastrocnemius avulsion.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: This study {{evaluated}} clinical features, diagnostic techniques, and {{summarized the}} results of open repair {{in a series of}} surgically confirmed cases of intratendinous rotator cuff tears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1999, 19 patients (17 men and 2 women) with intratendinous rotator cuff tears underwent surgery. Clinical findings, diagnostic results, and surgical findings were evaluated. The shoulder scores of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) were used to assess recovery at an average of 92 months (range, 31 - 231 months). RESULTS: All patients had symptoms consistent with rotator cuff tendonitis. History of overt trauma was noted in 16 (84. 2 %). Neither ultrasound nor magnetic resonance imaging proved reliable for preoperative diagnosis. Surgery was performed if at least 6 months of conservative treatment, such as rest, heat, and physical therapies, failed. The definitive diagnosis was established intraoperatively with a longitudinal split along the fibers of the supraspinatus tendon. None of the intratendinous lesions had communication to the subacromial bursa or the glenohumeral joint. Excision of the intratendinous tear and repair resulted in improvement in pain and total scores of both JOA (66. 8 vs 94. 1) and ASES (37. 1 vs 91. 0). CONCLUSIONS: Intratendinous rotator cuff tears were difficult to diagnose preoperatively.

Methods: Two porcine flexor digitorum tendon segments of equal length (8 cm) and thickness (1 cm) were placed side by side. Eight tenorrhaphies (involving sixteen tendons) were performed with each of four suture techniques (running locked, simple eight, vertical mattress, and pulley suture). The resulting constructs underwent cyclic loading on a tensile testing machine, followed by monotonically increasing tensile load if failure during cyclic loading did not occur. Clamps secured the tendons {{on each side of}} the repair, and specimens were mounted vertically. Cyclic loading varied between 15 N and 35 N, with a distension rate of 1 mm/sec. Cyclic loading strength was determined by applying a force of 70 N. The cause of failure and tendon distension during loading were recorded. Results: All failures occurred in the monotonic loading phase and resulted from tendon stripping. No suture or knot failure was observed. The mean loads resisted by the configurations ranged from 138 to 398 N. The mean load to failure, maximum load resisted prior to 1 cm of distension, and load resisted at 1 cm of distension were significantly lower for the vertical mattress suture group than for any of the other three groups (p < 0. 031). Conclusions: All four groups sustained loads well above the physiologic loads expected to occur in tendons in the foot and ankle (e. g., in tendon transfer for tibialis posterior tendon insufficiency). None of the four side-to-side configurations distended appreciably during the cyclic loading phase. The vertical mattress suture configuration appeared to be weake...|$|E
30|$|The {{case report}} {{described}} here {{shows how the}} appropriate surgical treatment and the subsequent rehabilitation program are key to a successful outcome, {{especially in the case}} of a chronic injury. Critically reviewing the history of our patient, many doubts about the first surgical procedure performed arise: as the correct diagnosis for this patient was missed at the beginning, a simple end-to-end suture of the tendon must have been considered a risky choice, associated with a high chance of recurrence. Indeed, despite the slow postoperative rehabilitation performed, the <b>tenorrhaphy</b> failed. Then a second failure occurred, which could have been due to the poor quality of the residual tendon on which the bone-patellar-tendon graft was sutured. As shown by our preoperative MRI exam, the re-rupture of the revised tendon occurred in exactly the same place (in the midsubstance of the proximal third of the patellar tendon), while the bone stock of the allograft was in place and intact. Even in this case, a cautious rehabilitative protocol did not protect the surgical procedure. For these reasons, we chose a reconstruction involving the use of an augmentation provided by the gracilis and semitendinosus tendons in a figure-of-eight shape. Moreover, to provide better quality augmentation, we left their tibial insertion intact in order to get a better vascularized autograft and preserve a safe and strong distal insertion. Despite the satisfactory stability of the reconstruction performed, and despite appearance of the postoperative radiograph, which showed a good level for the patellar bone height, we decided on a slow postoperative protocol: the risk of a new tendon rupture was thought to be much more significant, and therefore we risked the loss of a few degrees in the range of motion. Respecting the biological time of repair required for the autograft was the first goal of our rehabilitative procedure.|$|E
30|$|Previous studies {{hypothesized}} that a knotless flexor tendon repair using bidirectional barbed suture {{has a similar}} breaking force to a traditional knotted technique but with a smaller change in the repair site cross-sectional area. This was proven by McClellan et al. [7] who compared, in a porcine model, two conventional techniques, the 2 -strand Kessler and the 4 -strand Savage, with a 4 -strand barbed <b>tenorrhaphy.</b> By testing the 2 -mm gap formation force and the load to failure, they demonstrated that Savage and barbed techniques have equivalent breaking force, both significantly greater than the Kessler method. As regards tendon deformity, the repair site cross-sectional area of tendon repaired with the knotless technique was significantly smaller than that of tendons repaired with Kessler and Savage techniques. Parikh et al. [5] compared, in cadaver flexor tendons, 3 -strand and 6 -strand barbed suture techniques to a knotted 4 -strand cruciate technique, demonstrating that the 3 -strand barbed suture achieved a breaking force {{comparable to that of}} 4 -strand cruciate repair, but with significantly less repair site bunching. In the 6 -strand barbed suture technique an increased breaking force and significantly less repair site bunching have been recorded, compared with 4 -strand cruciate repair. When trying to critically analyze the literature, in each study one finds that the tendon repair technique, number of strands, suture material and suture diameter between control and experimental groups change, making it difficult to compare the results. Another disadvantage of these studies lies in the lack of cyclical testing that models in vivo situations more realistically than linear tests alone. Recently, Zeplin et al. [13] compared a knotted with a knotless tendon repair technique, applying linear and cyclical loads, without detecting any difference in breaking force between the two groups in both situations.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{report the}} {{long-term}} outcome (return {{to work and}} owner satisfaction) following surgical treatment of common calcanean tendon (Achilles tendon) injuries in working dogs in New Zealand. METHODS: Ten New Zealand Huntaway or Heading dogs (working Collies) with complete or partial tears of the common calcanean tendon, were treated using locking-loop suturing and casting, with (7) or without (3), a calcaneo-tibial screw. All dogs were actively in work on sheep or cattle farms {{at the time of}} injury, and return to work was the desired outcome. Ability to work and owner satisfaction were investigated using a telephone questionnaire at a mean followup interval of 14. 6 months. RESULTS: Overall, 7 / 10 dogs returned to full or substantial levels of work. Post-operative complications occurred in two dogs that did not return to full or substantial levels of work. Moderate persistent lameness (score 3 on a scale of 0 - 5) was present in 2 / 7 dogs that returned to full or substantial levels of work, equating to a 71 % good-to-excellent functional outcome within this group. Seven owners felt the financial investment in opting for surgical repair was worthwhile. A screw and cast method of rigid immobilisation was thought to be superior to casting alone. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of common calcanean tendon injury in working dogs carries a good prognosis if an appropriate <b>tenorrhaphy</b> technique is used and rigid immobilisation is achieved for 6 weeks. Care must be taken to limit post-operative complications. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study justifies the use of surgical repair of such injuries in the working dog even when return to work is the only acceptable outcome. A. J. Worth, F. Danielsson, J. P.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Controlled {{laboratory}} study. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} effect of low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound on the murine calcaneus tendon healing process. BACKGROUND: Therapeutic ultrasound promotes formation and maturation of scar tissue. METHODS: Calcaneus tendon tenotomy and <b>tenorrhaphy</b> was performed on 28 Wistar rats. After the procedure, the animals were randomly divided into 2 groups. the animals {{in the experimental group}} received a 5 -minute ultrasound application, once a day, at a frequency of 1 MHz, a spatial average temporal average intensity of 0. 1 W/cm(2), and a spatial average intensity of 0. 52 W/cm(2) at a 16 -Hz frequency pulse mode (duty cycle, 20 %). Data for the injured side were normalized in relation to the data from the contralateral healthy calcaneus tendon (relative values). the animals in the control group received sham treatment. After a 28 -day treatment period, the animals were sacrificed and their tendons surgically removed and subjected to mechanical stress testing. the parameters analyzed were cross-sectional area (mm(2)), ultimate load (N), tensile strength (MPa), and energy absorption (mJ). RESULTS: A significant difference between groups was found for the relative values of ultimate load and tensile strength. the mean +/- SD ultimate load of the control group was - 3. 5 % +/- 32. 2 % compared to 33. 3 % +/- 26. 8 % for the experimental group (P =. 005). the mean tensile strength of the control group was - 47. 7 % +/- 19. 5 % compared to - 28. 1 % +/- 24. 1 % for the experimental group (P =. 019). No significant difference was found in cross-sectional area and energy absorption. CONCLUSION: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound produced by a conventional therapeutic ultrasound unit can positively influence the calcaneus tendon healing process in rats.
