5000|$|Citizens of {{one member}} nation of the European Union {{are allowed to}} work in other member nations with little to no {{restriction}} on movement. This is aided by <b>the</b> <b>EURES</b> <b>network,</b> which brings together the European Commission and the public employment services of the countries belonging to the European Economic Area and Switzerland. For non-EU-citizen permanent residents in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult. After 155 new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have often introduced measures to restrict participation in [...] "their" [...] labour markets by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain each restricted their labor market for up to seven years both in the 2004 and 2007 round of accession.|$|E

40|$|Demographic {{changes in}} the form of an aging {{population}} will lead to that the number of workers decreases, while the share of non-workers will increase, leading to a labor shortage in Sweden. One way to solve this is to increase labor migration. Employers already finds it difficult to find the skills they are looking for within their borders, but to their help is <b>the</b> <b>Eures</b> <b>network</b> whose mission is to facilitate the matching of labor within the EU / EEA and Switzerland. As the competition for labor is high, it requires that organizations adapt their skills to be able to attract labor. The study aims to examine how organizations adapt their skills through overseas recruiting and investigate the role of Eures for organizations. The purpose was investigated by a qualitative method; six interviews were conducted with individuals who had recruited abroad. The method was chosen to provide a deeper understanding of how employers solve problems in the labor market and to determine if Eures is a good support to solve this. The theories used are about networking, recruitment, skills and competence and motivation¬. The results showed that recruiters used multiple media to reach out to the candidates and the major differences compared with recruiting in Sweden was that it took longer and cost more money. Foreign Recruitment resulted in an injection of expertise but also a greater need for skills development. Eures is used for job posting, distribution of CV's, information on housing conditions as well as "a hub" to coordinate contacts. Even though respondents were satisfied with the Eures they experienced that the network could improve its service existing screening, reference checks and the number of meetings with organizations.
