50|$|Applications perform DNS lookups {{with the}} aid of a DLL. They call library {{functions}} in the DLL, which in <b>turn</b> <b>handle</b> all communications with DNS servers (over UDP or TCP) and return the final results of the lookup back to the applications.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, agent {{handling}} is done indirectly, through [...] "principal agents" [...] {{that serve}} as proxies for case officers. It is not uncommon, for example, for a case officer to manage a number of principal agents, who in <b>turn</b> <b>handle</b> agent networks, which are preferably organized in a cellular fashion. In such a case, the principal agent {{can serve as a}} [...] "cut-out" [...] for the case officer, buffering him or her from direct contact with the agent network.|$|E

50|$|Spiralizers usually contain three blades: a round blade for spaghetti, a small {{flat blade}} for ribbons, {{and a large}} wide blade for spiral strands. Vegetables are clamped between the blade and crank. As the <b>handle</b> <b>turns</b> {{with a bit of}} pressure, the {{vegetable}} is pressed between the <b>turning</b> <b>handle</b> and the blade, which cuts it into spirals.|$|R
5000|$|Gent's saw or Gentleman's saw (rare) [...] - [...] a small {{dovetail}} saw {{with a straight}} <b>turned</b> <b>handle,</b> rather than an open one typical of most saws. The name seems to have arisen from its use by the nineteenth century dilettante who would now be called a hobbyist {{but it is hard}} to find a nineteenth century reference to it. For example, in the section on tools in Every Man his own Mechanic (1881) (816pp), tenon, dovetail and sash saws are listed as a group but there is no mention of a gent's saw. It is adapted for use in making joints in very small woodwork such as that in some musical instruments, dolls' furniture or other model-making. Its distinguishing features are its small size and <b>turned</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R

25|$|Users {{generally}} do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as web browsers, e-mail clients, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the DNS resolver in the local operating system, which in <b>turn</b> <b>handles</b> the communications required.|$|R

Includes replaceable tip comprising ferrule and tubular expansion sleeve sized for sliding fit into tube to be expanded. Expansion sleeve swells in response to internal hydraulic pressure generated by <b>turning</b> <b>handle</b> and thereby advancing piston...|$|R
50|$|The Netscape Proxy Server version 3.x was {{essentially}} a coupling between the Netscape browser client, responsible for talking to remote servers, and the Netscape web server 4.x, which in <b>turn</b> <b>handled</b> the duty of talking to a client. Support for multithreading was absent, and the Proxy server operated in multi-process mode where each request was handled by a dedicated process.|$|R

5000|$|Wile E. uses a double-barreled shotgun as a {{look-through}} attraction called [...] "Secrets of a Harem". The Road Runner {{looks through}} the holes of the shotgun while <b>turning</b> a <b>handle,</b> while Wile E. prepares to fire the shotgun. He looks at the Road Runner and thinking that he is turning it incorrectly, pushes him away and <b>turns</b> the <b>handle</b> himself, causing the shotgun to fire into his face.|$|R

25|$|The Hawk is an {{advanced}} trainer with a two-man tandem cockpit, a low-mounted cantilever wing and {{is powered by}} a single turbofan engine. Unlike many of the previous trainers in RAF service, the Hawk was specifically designed for training. Hawker had developed the aircraft to have a high level of servicability, as well as lower purchasing and operating costs than previous trainers like the Jet Provost. The Hawk has been praised by pilots for its agility, in particular its roll and <b>turn</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|R

40|$|A pinking machine cuts a {{perforated}} edge (zig zag or scallop pattern) on fabric. The existing device, {{which is}} fabricated with cast iron base and arm, wooden handle and tempered steel tool cutter, operates by <b>turning</b> a <b>handle</b> through {{a gear train}} to rotate the cutter. The current method requires the operator to use one hand to <b>turn</b> the <b>handle</b> and the other hand to control the fabric. With {{the use of a}} parallel shaft gearmotor and an AC-DC rheostat, a person may handle the material with both hands for better control...|$|R
