40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study {{a more flexible}} alternative of conceptualising changes over time in teams is tested within student project teams. The conceptualisation uses <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> during the lifespan of a team to outline team development, based on work by Erbert, Mearns, & Dena (2005). <b>Turning</b> <b>points</b> are moments that made a significant difference {{during the course of}} the collaboration as a team. In this study, they are tracked by means of team interviews and reflection papers of team members. A method of coding was created to collect all information about the <b>turning</b> <b>points,</b> their causes and consequences. By means of a thorough analysis of these coded data an overview of their nature and their effects on the rest of the team process as perceived by the team members themselves is provided.
