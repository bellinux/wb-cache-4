Popular products such as the Ionic Breeze and exclusive models of Human Touch massage chairs helped propel <b>The</b> <b>Sharper</b> Image to become an iconic American brand with 187 retail stores in 38 states.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} factory loads, {{produced and}} sold by <b>the</b> <b>Sharps</b> Rifle Manufacturing Company and <b>the</b> <b>Sharps</b> Rifle Company were [...]50/100/425 (.50 caliber/100 grains black powder/425 grain grease grooved bullet) and [...]50/100/473 {{with a paper}} patched bullet. [...] Factory loads manufactured by any of <b>the</b> <b>Sharps</b> companies were mostly hand-loaded which made them expensive to produce. [...] This naturally invited competition. [...] Winchester offered the cartridge loaded [...]50/90/473 with paper patched bullets which may be how the cartridge came to be {{commonly known as the}} [...]50-90. [...] <b>The</b> [...]50-90 <b>Sharps</b> is similar to <b>the</b> [...]50-100 <b>Sharps</b> and [...]50-110 Sharps cartridges. [...] All three use the same [...] case, the latter two being loaded with more grains of black powder. All rifles made for <b>the</b> [...]50-90 <b>Sharps</b> should {{be able to use the}} [...]50-110 and [...]50-100 cartridges due to the case dimensions being nearly identical.|$|R

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> fall in {{bond prices}} of 2013 ("taper tantrum"), investors {{continued}} {{to question the}} impact of rising rates on risk parity portfolios or other more concentrated equity portfolios. A historical analysis of episodes of rising rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes. Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over time is not dependent on falling bond yields.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. <b>The</b> <b>sharp</b> point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is {{the main reason for}} the decline of population.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate.

5|$|In {{gray iron}} the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the {{material}} brittle due to <b>the</b> <b>sharp</b> edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, {{referred to as}} ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sharps</b> Rifle was {{produced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Sharps</b> Rifle Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut. It {{was used in the}} Civil War by multiple Union units, most famously by the U.S. Army Marksman, known popularly as [...] "Berdan's Sharpshooters" [...] in honor of their leader Hiram Berdan. <b>The</b> <b>Sharps</b> made a superior sniper weapon of greater accuracy than the more commonly issued muzzle-loading rifled muskets. This was due mainly to the higher rate of fire of the breech loading mechanism and superior quality of manufacture, as well as the ease of which it could be reloaded from a kneeling or prone position.|$|R
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings.

5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike.
