25|$|The equestrian sculptures are {{particularly}} important, starting chronologically with two {{designed in the}} 17th century: the statue of Philip III, in the Plaza Mayor by Giambologna, and the statue of Philip IV, in the Plaza de Oriente (undoubtedly the most important statue of Madrid, projected by Velázquez and built by Pietro <b>Tacca</b> with scientific advice of Galileo Galilei).|$|E
25|$|For the {{execution}} of its astonishing revetment of marbles inlaid with colored marbles and semi-precious stone, the Grand Ducal hardstone workshop, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure was established. The art of commessi, {{as it was called}} in Florence, assembled jig-sawn fragments of specimen stones to form the designs of the revetment that entirely cover the walls. The result was disapproved of by 18th and 19th century visitors, but has come to be appreciated for an example of the taste of its time. Six grand sarcophagi are empty; the Medici remains are interred in the crypt below. In sixteen compartments of the dado are coats-of-arms of Tuscan cities under Medici control. In the niches that were intended to hold portrait sculptures of Medici, two (Ferdinando I and Cosimo II) were executed by Pietro <b>Tacca</b> (1626–42).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tacca's</b> bronze, {{which has}} eclipsed the Roman marble {{that served as}} model, was {{originally}} intended for the Boboli Garden, then moved to the Mercato Nuovo in Florence, Italy; the fountain was placed originally facing east, in via Calimala, {{in front of the}} pharmacy that by association gained the name Farmacia del Cinghiale (Italian for [...] "boar"). To gain more space for market traffic it was later moved to the side facing south, where it still stands {{as one of the most}} popular features for tourists. The present statue is a modern copy, cast in 1998 by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry and replaced in 2008, while <b>Tacca's</b> bronze is sheltered in the new Museo Stefano Bardini in Palazzo Mozzi.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tacca's</b> {{public works}} for the Medici include his masterpieces, the [...] "Monument of the Four Moors", {{representing}} captured Barbary corsairs or Ottoman pirates (1620 - 24) {{at the foot of}} Baccio Bandinelli's statue of Ferdinand I de' Medici, intended to celebrate the above-mentioned victories, in Piazza della Darsena, Livorno. Reduced scale bronze adaptations were made by Foggini and these were to be the basis of reproductions for connoisseurs into the 18th century. Ceramic versions were made by Doccia and other manufacturers. One of <b>Tacca's</b> disciples, Taddeo di Michele, executed a trophy of Barbary arms accompanying the prisoners; it was looted by French troops in 1799 and is now in the Louvre Museum.|$|R
50|$|The ostentatious {{design of}} the tomb of Doge Giovanni Pesaro, which was built in 1669 in Venice, and is found in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari close to the Pesaro Altarpiece, was perhaps {{strongly}} influenced by <b>Tacca's</b> monument of the four Moors.|$|R
50|$|The four Moors symbolise {{the four}} corners of the world. <b>Tacca's</b> design of the Moors {{monument}} is assumed to have been influenced by three columns in the shape of African men supporting a balcony in Via Carriona in Carrara. The three sculptures are depicted as suffering from the weight they bear supporting the iron structure.|$|R

50|$|He {{added the}} final touches to <b>Tacca's</b> Chapel of the Princes in San Lorenzo. In 1679 he {{designed}} for the Grand Duke the church of Santi Quirico, Lucia e Pietro d'Alcantara and its attached convent of the Reformed Friars Minor. The church is near the Medici Villa dell’Ambrogiana and connected to it by a passageway. In 1680, Baldi is recorded as superintendent of the buildings and fortifications of Livorno. He {{was buried in the}} cloister of the above convent.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was painted}} while its subject called on Velazquez {{during a trip}} to Madrid between June 1635 and January 1636. The trip was to make a clay bust of Philip IV of Spain as the modello for the Florentine {{sculptor}} Pietro <b>Tacca's</b> bronze equestrian statue of Philip (the statue now on plaza de Oriente in Madrid), which is what he is shown doing in the portrait, shaping the clay with a stick (though the bust itself is only in outline, since the painting is unfinished).|$|R
50|$|He later {{travelled}} via Paris to Rome. In Rome he copied both antique {{and modern}} works. Here he also met Anthony van Dyck and François Duquesnoy, the leading Flemish {{representatives of the}} Baroque in respectively painting and sculpture in Rome. He resided in Genoa from 1622 to 1624 where he received many commissions from local noble families. He was regarded by his patrons as the greatest ivory carver of his time. He subsequently travelled to Livorno, where he made studies after Pietro <b>Tacca’s</b> bronze Slaves, {{which is part of}} the monument to Ferdinand I de’ Medici on the Piazza della Darsena. He returned to Antwerp in 1624 where he visited Rubens again.|$|R
50|$|His son Ferdinando <b>Tacca</b> {{assisted}} {{him in the}} atelier; {{the inventory}} (1687) after his death included sculptures doubtless by Pietro <b>Tacca</b> http://www.liechtensteinmuseum.at/de/pages/artbase_main.asp?module=browse&action=m_work&lang=de&sid=674783807&oid=W-542005134758570.

5000|$|<b>Tacca's</b> last public {{commission}} was the colossal equestrian bronze of Philip IV, after a design by Velázquez. It is also {{said to have}} been based on the iconography of a lost painting by Rubens; it was begun in 1634 and shipped to Madrid in 1640, the year of his death. The sculpture, atop a complicated fountain composition, forms the centerpiece of the façade of the Royal Palace. The daring stability of the statue was calculated by Galileo Galilei: the horse rears, and the entire weight of the sculpture balances on the two rear legs - and, discreetly, its tail - [...] a feat that had never been attempted in a figure on a heroic scale, of which Leonardo had dreamed.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Peacham was {{informed}} that Le Sueur was a pupil of Giambologna in Florence. Though he is not otherwise documented in Florence, in Paris he was recorded as sculpteur du Roy at the baptism of his son at Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois in 1610, when a royal secretary and the daughter of another served as witnesses. In London he and his second wife were of the Huguenot congregation in Threadneedle Street. He worked with Pietro <b>Tacca's</b> assistants on the equestrian bronze of Henri IV on the Pont Neuf, a project that gave him technical skills that were put to use in his equestrian Charles I. Since Inigo Jones had passed through Paris in July 1613, in the train of Lord Arundel, {{on their way to}} Strasbourg, Katharine Esdaile suggested that Jones was the one who convinced Le Sueur to go to England. The earliest occasion on which Le Sueur received an official commission in England was for twelve figures against the frieze of the grand catafalque— both figures and hearse designed by Inigo Jones — in James I's funeral, 1625. In 1631 he was dispatched to Rome to arrange to have moulds taken of classical antiquities, to complement the Borghese Gladiator, moulds of which had been obtained for Charles, and which Le Sueur cast in London for the Privy Garden of the Palace of Whitehall. Henry Peacham praised Le Sueur for his skill and credits the Catholic priest and agent, George Gage, with obtaining the relevant casts in Rome: [...] "The best of them is the Gladiator, molded from that in Cardinall Borgheses Villa, by the procurement and industry of ingenious Master Gage." ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the stone}} monumental {{artefacts}} artistic fountains are extremely favorable to formation of biofilms, {{giving rise to}} biodegradation processes related with physical-chemical and visual aspect alterations, because of their particular exposure conditions. Microbial diversity of five fountains (two from Spain and three from Italy) was investigated. It was observed an ample similarity between the biodiversity of monumental stones reported in literature and that one found in studied fountains. Mechanical procedures and toxic chemical products are usually employed to remove such phototrophic patinas. Alternative methods based on natural antifouling substances are recently experimented in the marine sector, due to their very low environmental impact and for the bio settlement prevention on partially immersed structures of ships. In the present work groups of antibiofouling agents (ABAs) were selected from literature {{for their ability to}} interfere, at molecular level, with the microbial communication system “quorum sensing”, inhibiting the initial phase of biofilm formation. The efficacy of some natural antibiofoulants agents (ABAs) with terrestrial (Capsaicine - CS, Cinnamaldehyde - CI) and marine origin (Zosteric Acid - ZA, poly-Alkyl Pyridinium Salts – pAPS and Ceramium botryocarpum extract - CBE), incorporated into two commercial coatings (Silres BS OH 100 - S and Wacker Silres BS 290 - W) commonly used in stone conservation procedures were evaluated. The formation of phototrophic biofilms in laboratory conditions (on Carrara marble specimens and Sierra Elvira stone) and on two monumental fountains (<b>Tacca’s</b> Fountain 2 - Florence, Italy and Fountain from Patio de la Lindaraja - Alhambra Palace, Granada, Spain) has been investigated in {{the presence or absence of}} these natural antifouling agents. The natural antibiofouling agents, at tested concentrations, demonstrated a certain inhibitory effect. The silane-siloxane based silicone coating (W) mixing with ABAs was more suitable with respect to ethyl silicate coating (S) and proved efficacy against biofilm formation only when incompletely cured. The laboratory results indicated a positive action in inhibiting the patina formation, especially for poly-alkyl pyridinium salts, zosteric acid and cinnamaldehyde, while on site tests revealed a good effect for zosteric acid...|$|R
