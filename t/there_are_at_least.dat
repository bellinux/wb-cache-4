5|$|The geology of the Grand Canyon area {{includes}} one of {{the most}} complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand Canyon National Park area range in age from about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Thebe {{is dark and}} appears to be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (probably ice) from the interior of the moon. The surface of Thebe is heavily cratered and it appears that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three or four impact craters that are very large, each being roughly comparable in size to Thebe itself.|$|E
