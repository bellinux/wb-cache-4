The highest average detachment percentage was 80. 03 % at the lowest forward speed of 0. 62 mi/hr, while the minimum detaching percentage 72. 98 %, {{was the result of the}} machine forward speed of 1. 42 mi/hr. The initial trials also found that changing the lengths of the turn buckles to adjust the shaking beaters position on the canopy shaker significantly affected the grapefruit detachment percentage at the 10 % level of significance. The third beaters' position (turn buckles length 16 inches) had the highest average of 87. 97 %. The beaters shaking speed also significantly affected the grapefruit detachment percentage at the 10 % level of significance. By increasing the beater shaking speed from 56. 50 to 73 in/sec, the grapefruit detachment percentage increased up to 79. 72 % (the maximum average). Also, by increasing the length of the additional beaters, the maximum grapefruit detachment percentage increased to 93. 29 %. On the other hand, the average magnitude of the acceleration (g) among the tree canopy branches increased significantly (average magnitude 8. 65 g) when the shaking beater number was increased from 14 beaters to 26 beaters. Looking at the previous findings, this study recommends operating the new prototype citrus harvesting machine either at forward speed 0. 62 mi/hr or 1. 42 mi/hr, with the <b>turn</b> <b>buckle</b> length at 16 inches, and the beaters' shaking speed at 73 in/sec. These configurations resulted in higher grapefruit detachment percentages, with averages 93. 56 % and 93. 52 %, respectively. Finally, some minor visible damages, such as splits to some branch crotch angles, have occurred during grapefruit harvesting due to impact of the harvester's beaters with the branches underneath tree canopies. However, when operating at a harvesting width of 69 inches, which was utilized during May 2013 canopy shaker field operations, no damages to the grapefruit tree trunks were observed. The trunks were unaffected by the harvester's shaking beaters unless the harvester's operator could not maintain the main trunk of each tree as the center of the harvesting direction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the effects of train induced {{vibrations}} in a steel Langer beam bridge. A case study of a bridge over the river Ljungan in Ånge has been made by analysing measurements and comparing the results with a finite element model in ABAQUS. The critical details of the bridge are the hangers that {{are connected to the}} arches and the main beams. A stabilising system has been made {{in order to reduce the}} vibrations which would lead to increased life length of the bridge. Initially, the background to this thesis and a description of the studied bridge are presented. An introduction of the theories that has been applied is given and a description of the modelling procedure in ABAQUS is presented. The performed measurements investigated the induced strain and accelerations in the hangers. The natural frequency, the corresponding damping coefficients and the displacement these vibrations leads to has been evaluated. The vibration-induced stresses, which could lead to fatigue, have been evaluated. The measurement was made after the existing stabilising system has been dismantled and this results in that the risk of fatigue is excessive. The results were separated into two parts: train passage and free vibrations. This shows that the free vibrations contribute more and longer life expectancy could be achieved by introducing dampers, to reduce the amplitude of the amplitude of free vibrations. The finite element modelling is divided into four categories: general static analysis, eigenvalue analysis, dynamic analysis and detailed analysis of the <b>turn</b> <b>buckle</b> in the hangers. The deflection of the bridge and the initial stresses due to gravity load were evaluated in the static analysis. The eigenfrequencies were extracted in an eigenvalue analysis, both concerning eigenfrequencies in the hangers as well as global modes of the bridge. The main part of the finite element modelling involves the dynamic simulation of the train passing the bridge. The model shows that the longer hangers vibrate excessively during the train passage because of resonance. An analysis of a model with a stabilising system shows that the vibrations are damped in the direction along the bridge but are instead increased in the perpendicular direction. The results from the model agree with the measured data when dealing with stresses. When comparing the results concerning the displacement of the hangers, accurate filtering must be applied to obtain similar results...|$|E

40|$|Cyclophilin A (CypA) is the well-studied {{member of}} a group of {{ubiquitous}} and evolutionarily conserved families of enzymes called peptidyl–prolyl isomerases (PPIases). These enzymes catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bond in many proteins. The distinctive functional path triggered by each isomeric state of peptidyl-prolyl bond renders PPIase-catalyzed isomerization a molecular switching mechanism to be used on physiological demand. PPIase activity has been implicated in protein folding, signal transduction, and ion channel gating as well as pathological condition such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, and microbial infections. The more than five order of magnitude speed-up in the rate of peptidyl–prolyl cis–trans isomerization by CypA has been the target of intense research. Normal and accelerated molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism of CypA in atomistic details. The results reaffirm transition state stabilization as the main factor in the astonishing enhancement in isomerization rate by enzyme. The ensuing intramolecular polarization, {{as a result of the}} loss of pseudo double bond character of the peptide bond at the transition state, was shown to contribute only about − 1. 0 kcal/mol to stabilizing the transition state. This relatively small contribution demonstrates that routinely used fixed charge classical force fields can reasonably describe these types of biological systems. The computational studies also revealed that the undemanding exchange of the free substrate between β- and α-helical regions is lost in the active site of the enzyme, where it is mainly in the β-region. The resultant relative change in conformational entropy favorably contributes to the free energy of stabilizing the transition state by CypA. The isomerization kinetics is strongly coupled to the enzyme motions while the chemical step and enzyme–substrate dynamics are in <b>turn</b> <b>buckled</b> to solvent fluctuations. The chemical step in the active site of the enzyme is therefore not separated from the fluctuations in the solvent.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of rocks is commonly intimately associated with metamorphic reactions. This paper {{is a step}} towards understanding the behaviour of fully coupled, deforming, chemically reacting systems by considering a simple example of the problem comprising a single layer system with elastic-power law viscous constitutive behaviour where the deformation {{is controlled by the}} diffusion of a single chemical component that is produced during a metamorphic reaction. Analysis of the problem using the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows the energy dissipated by the chemical reaction-diffusion processes to be coupled with the energy dissipated during {{deformation of}} the layers.

Various practically possible loading configurations are examined and their effect on buckling characteristics is assessed. To model more accurately the buckling behaviour of multi-layered graphene sheets, a physically more representative and realistic mixed boundary support concept is proposed and applied.

6000|$|The most {{insignificant}} {{of literary}} contributions {{have a history}} and an origin; {{and the history of}} these contributions is short and simple enough. Carlyle with all the force of his humoristic genius had impressed upon his generation an essentially one-sided view both of the eighteenth century as a whole, and of the French thinkers of that century in particular. His essay on Diderot, his lecture on Rousseau, his chapters on Voltaire, with all their brilliance, penetration, and incomparable satire, were the high-water mark in this country of the literary reaction against the French school of Revolution. Everybody knows the famous diatribes against the Bankrupt Century and all its men and all its works. Voltaire's furies, Diderot's indigestions, Rousseau's nauseous amours, and the odd tricks and shifts of the whole of them and their company, offered ready material for the boisterous horseplay of the transcendental humourist. Then the tide began to <b>turn.</b> Mr. <b>Buckle's</b> book on the history of civilisation {{had something to do with}} it. But it was the historical chapters in Comte's Positive Philosophy that first opened the minds of many of us, who, five-and-twenty years ago, were young men, to a very different judgment of the true place of those schools in the literary and social history of Western Europe. We learnt to perceive that though much in the thought and the lives of the literary precursors of the Revolution laid them fairly open to Carlyle's banter, yet banter was not all, and even grave condemnation was not all. In essays, like mine, written from this point of view, and with the object of trying to trim the balance rather more correctly, it may well have been that the better side of the thinkers concerned was sometimes unduly dwelt upon, and their worse side unduly left in the background. It may well have been that an impression of personal adhesion was conveyed which only very partially existed, or even where it did not exist at all: that is a risk of misinterpretation which it is always hard for the historical critic to escape. There may have been a too eager tone; but to be eager is not a very bad vice at any age under the critical forty. There were some needlessly aggressive passages, and some sallies which ought to have been avoided, because they gave pain to good people. There was perhaps too much of the particular excitement of the time. It was the date when Essays and Reviews was still thought a terrible explosive; when Bishop Colenso's arithmetical tests as to the flocks and herds of the children of Israel were believed to be sapping not only the inspiration of the Pentateuch but the foundations of the Faith and the Church; and when Darwin's scientific speculations were shaking the civilised world. Some excitement was to be pardoned in days like those, and I am quite sure that one side needed pardon at least as much as the other. For the substantial soundness of the general views winch I took of the French revolutionary thinkers at that time, I feel no apprehension; nor--some possible occasional phrases or sentences excepted and apart--do I see the smallest reason to shrink or to depart from any one of them.

40|$|When fire {{takes place}} in a steel frame, any heated column may buckle at some {{temperature}} due to deterioration in both the stiffness and the strength, although the external load to the frame remains unchanged during fire. This column’s buckling is likely a main cause of the instability for steel frames subjected to fire. Researches on the high temperature buckling of columns span, in fact, for decades. Culver (1973) was the first to analyze precisely the behavior of the buckling of columns by using finite element analysis. Referring to the experimental studies conducted by Burgess et al. (1992), Franssen has recently made a specific comparison between the test and numerical analysis results (1995, 1996). Although the studies on centrally compressed and simply supported columns provide the basic knowledge on the problem, the behaviors of the heated columns incorporated into the frame are different from those of isolated members. In fact, when fire occurs in a steel frame, the expanded and therefore elongated column is axially restrained by the rest of members, so that thermal compressive force is applied additionally to the heated column (Neves, 1995; Correia Rodrigues et al., 2000). As a result, the buckling temperature of the heated column is lowered due to this thermal stress. On the other hand, since the incorporated column is, at the same time, restrained rotationally at its ends by the neighboring members, the effective length of this column should become shorter than the column height and this raises in <b>turn</b> the <b>buckling</b> temperature of the column. Another facet of the problem is the overall stability of the frame, when and after the incorporated columns buckle due to fire. Some frames may fall into instability directly after the incorporated column buckle, while the other may remain stable and be able to sustain further increase in member temperature. Once the instability takes place, the former frame cannot maintain static equilibrium any more. This means that, to solve the problem, ordinary load controlled analysis is not applicable in this case, but we need to develop another new numerical method to analyze the unstable frames. For the latter stable frames with heated and buckled columns, on the other hand, stress redistribution capacity of the neighboring members may play an essential role on controlling their ultimate states. Therefore, to clarify the structural performances of the frames with heated and buckled columns, a special emphasis must be placed on their stabilities as well as their ultimate load carrying characteristics when and after several heated columns buckle. The adopted analysis method must be able to trace these natures of the problem accordingly. In view of the above observations, the main objectives of this study are to be set as follows: 1. To understand and to clarify the mechanics which control the overall stabilities of steel frames with heated and buckled columns. 2. To develop a numerical analysis program that can solve such stability problems of steel frames subjected to fire. 3. To clarify the buckling temperatures of the incorporated columns as well as the frame’s ultimate temperatures. 4. To find the actual ultimate states and the corresponding ultimate temperatures of steel frames subjected to fire. 5. To find the means to prevent the frames subjected to fire from instability. In order to achieve the above presented objectives, this dissertation is divided into five chapters, which are briefly described below. Chapter one starts with brief review of previous studies. Fire resistant design of steel structures is reviewed in many relevant aspects, the experimental tests, and numerical analysis. After that, the problem about instability in steel structure that occurred in the collapse of WTC Towers is summarized. This is considered an indispensable background for conceiving the objective of this study, which constitutes the above sections. In chapter 2, the stabilities and the ultimate behaviors of steel frames after the incorporated heated columns buckle are investigated extensively. If the surrounding members can redistribute the vertical load of the frame which has been carried by the buckled column, it may retain the stability and may not collapse immediately. On the contrary, when the surrounding members are weak, an overall frame will fall into instability directly due to column buckling. This chapter describes and discusses these problems specifically. Furthermore, in this chapter, the development of the numerical analysis method is described specifically, which can simulate both the stable and unstable behaviors of steel frames subjected to fire. The development is focused on the computational procedure to simulate an unstable and therefore actually a dynamic frame behavior purely by a static means. At the end of this chapter, example numerical solutions solved by the method developed are shown, where complete fire responses and realistic ultimate states due to fire of steel frames are illustrated and discussed extensively. By using the numerical method whereby the control of the analysis is switched between load and displacement methods, we can examine the behavior of the steel column subjected to fire until it overall collapses. The load controlled analysis is the increase-in-temperature method. While the displacement analysis is the analysis that one degree-of-freedom of the unstable member’s node is gripped, and it is moved in the direction that the unstable state is growing. The displacement analysis is carried out under the temperature that the structure loses its stability. By using this analysis method to analyze some examples of a steel structure subjected to fire, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The main unstable condition of a steel structure subjected to fire is the “snap-through” process. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. That means that the structure’s ability to remain stable while the surrounding members restrain the buckling column is intimately connected with the instabilities of the structure itself. ･ The collapse of the structure is not decided solely by the buckling of the heated column. The ultimate temperature of the structure’s collapse mode varies according to the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members. If the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is low, the structure loses its stability and collapses suddenly after the column buckles. In this case, the ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is lower than the column buckling temperature due to the thermal stress. However, if the stress redistribution ability of the surrounding members is high, the structure still keeps its stability even though the column buckles. The ultimate temperature of this kind of structure is more than the column buckling temperature. The third chapter clarifies specifically the buckling temperatures of steel columns incorporated into frames. The buckling temperature is defined as the one at which a column begins to show an apparent buckling deformation. The incorporated columns are restrained rotationally by the adjacent members when they buckle. Therefore the effective buckling length of the column is shorter than its height. In this chapter, simple closed form formulae are presented to estimate both the effective buckling length and the buckling temperature of an incorporated heated column. Finally, comparisons are made between the numerically solved buckling temperatures of incorporated columns and the corresponding theoretical predictions, and the accuracy and the applicability of the formula are discussed in detail. From the investigated results, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The rotationally restraining effect of the connecting members has an effect on the column’s buckling temperature. However, the thermal expansion of the beam does not have a direct affect on the buckling temperature. ･ The exterior column is not axially restrained by the adjacent members during the fire. The lower end of the heated column is rotationally restrained by the unheated connecting members, so its boundary condition can be assumed to be fixed end. On the other hand, for {{the upper end of the}} heated column’s case, the rotationally restraining effect of the upper-story unheated column can be neglected due to the thermal expansion of the beam. The buckling temperature of the exterior column can be assumed to be the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. ･ The interior column is strongly rotationally restrained by the adjacent members, so its effective length is equal to 0. 5 h. However, it is also axially restrained by the adjacent members. As a result it buckles at a temperature that is lower than the estimated buckling temperature. In this case, when considering the buckling temperature, the thermal effect should be included. An incorporated column is not only restrained rotationally as discussed in the previous chapter but, if it is heated, it is also restrained axially by the surrounding members. Chapter 4 clarifies the latter problems specifically. The axial restraint of the surrounding members plays two contrary roles on the stability action of the frame. Firstly, it adds axial compressive force to the incorporated column and so increased compressive force lowers the column’s buckling temperature. On the contrary, once the column buckles, the surrounding members turn to work so as to redistribute a part of the axial compressive force carried by the bucked column to other sound columns, which is therefore helps to strengthen the overall stability and to raise the ultimate temperature of the frame. This is called herein stress redistribution effect of the surrounding members. In this chapter, the lowering of the column’s buckling temperature and the raise of the frame’s ultimate temperature, which are both brought by the effects of the surrounding members, are formulated respectively in theoretical closed forms. Finally the numerical analysis, which are developed in Chapter 2, are conducted extensively to obtain the realistic column’s buckling and the frame’s ultimate temperatures of a lot of practical steel frames, which are used to verify the accuracy and the applicability of the above derived formulae. In this chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn: ･ The effects of the axially restraining members have two mechanical roles. The first role is to restrain an expanded heated column. As a result of this action, the thermal compressive force is added to the heated column. This causes a drop in buckling temperature of heated columns. On the contrary, the second role is to redistribute a part of the compressive force of the buckled column to other sound columns. As a result of this action, the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. It causes a rise of the ultimate temperature of a frame. However, if the second stress redistribution ability is not enough, it falls into instability immediately after the heated column buckles. The ultimate temperature for this frame is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature, since the buckling is affected by the first thermal effect. ･ Based on the above observation, it is found that a higher ultimate temperature of a frame is obtained if it has higher stress redistribution capacity. A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a frame is to install a suitably proportioned hat truss. A hatted frame is found to have definitely an improved redundancy. ･ Closed form formulae to predict both the buckling temperature of a heated column and the beam plastified temperature of a frame is presented herein. Conducting the numerical fire response analysis, the predicted temperatures are found to be in good agreement with the numerical results for various structural and heating conditions. The prediction to estimate the improved ultimate temperature of hatted frames is also proposed herein. In chapter 5, the conclusion of this thesis is drawn: ･ The “snap-through” phenomenon is the main unstable condition of steel structures subjected to fire. This snap-through easily occurs in the structure when the post-buckling residual force is low and the stiffness and the strength of the restraining members in the structure are low. ･ The column’s buckling temperature can be estimated by the theoretical buckling temperature when the effective length is determined from the proposed equation. The exterior column’s effective length ratio can be calculated from the proposed equation while the interior column’s effective length ratio is 0. 5. ･ In the case that the stress redistribution ability is not enough to retain the stability of the steel frame, the structure falls into the instability state and failure at the buckling temperature under thermal effect. It means the ultimate temperature of that structure is lower than the theoretical buckling temperature. However, in the case that the stress redistribution ability is high, a part of the compressive force of the buckled column is redistributed to other sound columns. As a result the structure can retain its stability after the column buckles. ･ The ultimate temperature can be determined by the higher temperature among the bucking temperature under thermal effect and the beam plastified temperature. ･ A way to improve the fire-resistance capacity of a steel frame is to increase the redundancy of the axial force to the steel frame.
