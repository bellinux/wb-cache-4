5|$|Smallpeice and Slattery were {{praised by}} Guthrie in 1964, when the airline {{reported}} a {{profit for the}} 1963–1964 financial year, commenting that {{he was unable to}} <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the performance and this his predecessors were largely responsible for the improved financial performance of the airline.|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours {{were removed}} from Kinneff Church and {{returned}} to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> saving the honours, though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E

5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
25|$|SDS {{had opposed}} {{the call for}} mass demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The group felt that mass demonstrations and electoral {{politics}} were not effective {{as a means of}} influencing national policy. But when the demonstrations proved popular and provoked a heavy-handed police response (as SDS predicted), the organization moved quickly to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the protests.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler {{are likely to have}} some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E

25|$|Sōjirō first {{appears in}} the storyline when he uses his superhuman speed to reach and assassinate {{government}} official Ōkubo Toshimichi, also killing the official's would-be samurai assassins who would historically <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> Ōkubo's death nonetheless. Later, after Senkaku's defeat, Sōjirō duels with Kenshin using Battōjutsu with the fight ending in a tie when their swords shattered. Sōjirō is then assigned by Shishio to gather the Jupongatana located in {{the east side of}} Japan.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{was born}} into a cricketing family and his dad must <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> his technique. He is {{actually}} a natural right-hander but his father felt that you should have the stronger hand {{at the top of the}} handle and he switched him around. Rogers attended Brydon Country School and played in their 1st Eleven as an allrounder along with Sean Ervine. His secondary education was at St. John's College where he was captain of the first eleven.|$|E
25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant {{in favor of the}} king or god in charge. A king may even <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.|$|E

After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> it, but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that he allowed his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer's Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> liberating Brussels.|$|E
25|$|Samir Kuntar {{spent nearly}} three decades in prison before being {{released}} on July 16, 2008 {{as part of an}} Israel-Hezbollah prisoner swap. He denied killing Danny and Einat (the child and her father), but admitted to killing Eliyahu Shachar, the policeman. He never expressed remorse for the killings. In Israel, Kuntar was considered the perpetrator {{of one of the most}} brutal terrorist attacks in the country's history, while in Lebanon he was widely regarded as a national hero. He was assassinated on December 19, 2015, in a suspected Israeli airstrike, though Israel did not confirm this and the Free Syrian Army would later <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> killing Kuntar.|$|E

25|$|While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, {{production}} on The Jazz Singer {{began with the}} shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn {{come up with some}} lines on the spot. On September 23, Motion Picture News reported that {{production on}} the film had been completed.|$|E
25|$|Between 26 October and 1 November was {{a period}} of quiet for resupply, then after 1 November {{followed}} three days of small gains. Haig had been irritated on Foch's insistence that Plumer's Second Army remain part of the GAF so that the French and Belgians could <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> liberating Brussels, and after an ill-tempered exchange of letters with Foch, Haig regained control of Second Army (4 November). German fighting capacity was deteriorating, with much of their resistance coming from machine guns and artillery. The last offensive began on 4 November, including Sambre-Oise (where the poet Wilfred Owen was killed) where makeshift tank bridges were used, and the Forest of Mormal where the BEF had fought in August 1914. The crossing of the Sambre (4 November) saw further mass surrenders of German troops and made the German High Command realise that they must make peace before their army, which they wanted at home to use to prevent Germany turning to Bolshevism, disintegrated altogether.|$|E
25|$|Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan accused Ahern of {{attempting}} {{in his autobiography}} to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the Gregory deal by claiming he was present in negotiations between Charles Haughey and Tony Gregory {{and that he had}} provided Haughey with estimates from Dublin City Council. The Gregory deal was an agreement negotiated between the independent socialist TD Tony Gregory and Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey {{in the aftermath of the}} February 1982 general election, which resulted in a hung Dáil. In return for supporting Haughey, Gregory was promised a deal worth 100 million pounds at the time, which was to be used to redevelop North Inner City Dublin and to provide a greater number of houses and employment in an area which was considered Ireland's poorest and most disadvantaged. Ahern had gone with Haughey to the negotiations with Gregory; he was immediately asked to leave by Gregory and was forced to wait publicly in his car outside for three and a half hours. Although both had been elected to the same constituency, they were fierce rivals and the relationship between them was often sour. O'Sullivan was Tony Gregory's director of elections and successor as a TD.|$|E

25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of soup in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{states of}} Ohio and North Carolina both <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the Wright {{brothers}} and their world-changing inventions—Ohio because the brothers developed and built their design in Dayton, and North Carolina because Kitty Hawk {{was the site}} of the Wrights' first powered flight. With a spirit of friendly rivalry, Ohio adopted the slogan [...] "Birthplace of Aviation" [...] (later [...] "Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers", recognizing not only the Wrights, but also astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, both Ohio natives).
