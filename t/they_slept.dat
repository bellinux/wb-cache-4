5|$|Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 {{when one}} of his wives, Rasolomananambonitany, {{inadvertently}} pushed him from the elevated bed where <b>they</b> <b>slept.</b> He was buried in the royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept of unity and instead fought one another in an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (17871810).|$|E
5|$|He {{had shot}} June in her bed, but {{she managed to}} get up and walk a few steps before {{collapsing}} and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice into the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as <b>they</b> <b>slept.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. <b>They</b> <b>slept</b> on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Eeldrop and Appleplex rented {{two small}} rooms in a disreputable part of town. Here they {{sometimes}} came at nightfall, here <b>they</b> sometimes <b>slept,</b> and after <b>they</b> had <b>slept,</b> <b>they</b> cooked oatmeal and departed {{in the morning}} for destinations unknown to each other. <b>They</b> sometimes <b>slept,</b> more often <b>they</b> talked, or looked out of the window.|$|R

5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, would certainly have been familiar with the story.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as <b>they</b> <b>slept.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as <b>they</b> <b>slept.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} {{hard by the}} storm. It is estimated that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. <b>They</b> <b>slept</b> on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} a wild yell was {{heard from the}} {{interior}} of the rocks, then another and another. Without waiting to consider anything, or hear any more, the captain dashed into the narrow passage, Ralph close behind him. They ran into the room in which <b>they</b> had <b>slept.</b> <b>They</b> looked on all sides, but saw nothing. Again, far away, they heard another yell, and they ran out again into the passage.|$|R

5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|E

5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests they see a play, which happens to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The American cavalry {{pursued the}} {{soldiers}} that had retreated from Coamo, {{but were not}} able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel S. Reber, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds every two hours, working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. <b>They</b> <b>slept</b> in improvised huts that did not protect them from the rain.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
60|$|The {{travellers}} had {{no difficulty}} whatever in purchasing food and forage on the way. <b>They</b> always <b>slept</b> in their tents now, and preferred Donna Maria's cooking {{to that which}} they could obtain in the small and generally dirty inns in the towns.|$|R
50|$|Not {{wanting to}} be left out, many boys claim <b>they</b> have <b>slept</b> with her. Mooney then claims she is {{pregnant}} which she knows will cause her religious parents to send her away where she can then escape and run away to Manhattan. However the plan backfires as the boys of the town, not wanting {{to appear to be}} the father, all confess that <b>they</b> have never <b>slept</b> with Mooney. Though Mooney orders Lou to punch them out to show they are liars they do not fall down when she hits them showing they are telling the truth.|$|R
60|$|Their {{night was}} not a {{pleasant}} one. The beds were simple, consisting only of hides stretched across wooden frames, but, as they very speedily found, there were numerous other inhabitants. <b>They</b> therefore <b>slept</b> but little, and were heartily glad when the first gleam of dawn appeared.|$|R

25|$|On December 31, 1969, three hitmen shot Yablonski, his wife, Margaret, and his 25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, as <b>they</b> <b>slept</b> in the Yablonski home in Clarksville, Pennsylvania.

60|$|On the {{previous}} night <b>they</b> had <b>slept</b> {{in the midst of}} a noisy throng who chattered and made merry until an exceedingly late hour, thus preventing the more weary from sleeping, and everywhere in the air, hanging like clouds, was the dust raised by the feet of so many men.|$|R
