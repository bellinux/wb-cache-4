5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from their letters, Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
5|$|The tea ship Dartmouth {{arrived in}} the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a {{circular}} letter calling for a mass meeting {{to be held at}} Faneuil Hall on November 29. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> being unloaded.|$|E

25|$|Clipper ships sacrificed cargo {{capacity}} for speed, {{but in some}} markets, the fast service allowed their owners to charge premium rates (<b>Tea</b> <b>from</b> China tasted better if it was fresh, so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also, faster speed meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which also helped {{make up for the}} diminished {{cargo capacity}}.|$|E

25|$|When coffee reached North America {{during the}} Colonial period, it was {{initially}} not {{as successful as}} it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> British merchants, and a general resolution among many Americans to avoid drinking tea following the 1773 Boston Tea Party.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{prolonged}} fermentation in ripened pu'erh and slow oxidization of aged raw pu'erh, these teas often lack the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, {{and can be}} brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> one pot of leaves. On the other hand, young raw pu'erh is known and expected {{to be strong and}} aromatic, yet very bitter and somewhat astringent when brewed, since these characteristics are believed to produce better aged raw pu'erh.|$|E
500|$|Argo {{began with}} 35 <b>teas</b> <b>from</b> around the world, {{including}} black tea, green tea and chamomile tisane {{as well as}} exotic <b>teas.</b> <b>From</b> the outset, it included a mix of traditional Asian teas as well as <b>teas</b> <b>from</b> exotic locations.

Several of Argo's teas are seasonal. One of its signature drinks is the teappuccino, a black tea mixed with steamed milk and froth, which the company has trademarked. The menu leverages the new wave of specialty teas that may be served sweetened or spiced and that are blended with milk, sparkling water or fruit juices.

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E
25|$|Food {{and drink}} is very {{important}} to the culture of the people of Benghazi, {{as it is in the}} rest of Libya. Many of the dishes and ingredients used are passed down as tradition from generation to generation. The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. <b>Tea</b> <b>from</b> Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.|$|E

25|$|Tea {{was first}} {{introduced}} to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century, at which time it was termed chá. The earliest European reference to tea, written as Chiai, came from Delle navigationi e viaggi written by a Venetian, Giambattista Ramusio, in 1545. The first recorded shipment of tea by a European nation was in 1607 when the Dutch East India Company moved a cargo of <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> Macao to Java, then two years later, the Dutch bought the first assignment of tea which was from Hirado in Japan to be shipped to Europe. Tea became a fashionable drink in The Hague in the Netherlands, and the Dutch introduced the drink to Germany, France and across the Atlantic to New Amsterdam (New York).|$|E
25|$|Quanah Parker is {{credited}} {{as one of}} the first important leaders of the Native American Church movement. Parker adopted the peyote religion after having been gored in southern Texas by a bull. Parker was visiting his uncle, John Parker, in Texas where he was attacked, giving him severe wounds. To fight an onset of blood burning fever, a Mexican curandera was summoned and she prepared a strong peyote <b>tea</b> <b>from</b> fresh peyote to heal him. Thereafter, Quanah Parker became involved with peyote, which contains hordenine, mescaline or phenylethylamine alkaloids, and tyramine which act as natural antibiotics when taken in a combined form. Clinical studies indicate that peyocactin, a water-soluble crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of the plant, proved an effective antibiotic against 18 strains of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, several other bacteria, and a fungus.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Europeans in the 17th century, {{outposts}} were established in Odisha Coast and Bengal. The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of Balasore, Pipili, Palur in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded Calcutta. In 1756, the British East India Company defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in Plassey and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. <b>Tea</b> <b>from</b> Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the American War of Independence in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded {{with the rest of the}} British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Surinam and South Africa.|$|E
