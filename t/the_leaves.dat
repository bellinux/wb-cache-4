5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
50|$|After the Junior Certificate, the {{students}} enter the transition year programme followed by <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate (3-Year) or go directly into <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate Applied programme (2-Year). <b>The</b> <b>Leaving</b> Cert applied programme (LCA) caters for only around twenty students {{and does not}} provide the same qualifications as <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate.

50|$|Under basic conditions, a {{nucleophile}} (Nuc) {{attacks the}} carbonyl {{group of the}} acyl compound 1 to give tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate 2. The intermediate collapses and expels <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group (X) to give the substitution product 3. While nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions can be base-catalyzed, the reaction will not occur if <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group is a weaker base than the nucleophile (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group must have a higher pKa than the nucleophile). Unlike acid-catalyzed processes, both the nucleophile and <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group exist as anions under basic conditions.|$|R

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} of the trunk is to raise <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> above the ground, {{enabling}} the tree to reach the light and survive: the tree can overtop other plants and shade them out. It also performs the task of transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree and to distribute the food produced by <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> to all other parts including the roots.|$|E
5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area. One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5km apart, and differ somewhat. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E
50|$|Electronegativity of <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group - Increasing the {{electronegativity}} of <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> {{alkyl group}} stabilizes the metal-carbon bond interaction and thus increases the activation energy required for migration, decreasing the reaction rate.|$|R
50|$|All schools {{which are}} {{provided}} {{for by the}} State, including privately run and fee-paying secondary schools, teach the national curriculum. All {{students are expected to}} take the standardised Junior Certificate examination after three years. An optional non-academic Transition Year is provided by most but not all schools immediately following the Junior Certificate. Students subsequently take one of three <b>Leaving</b> Certificate programmes: <b>the</b> traditional <b>Leaving</b> Certificate, <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) or <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate Applied (LCA). The vast majority of students in Ireland take <b>the</b> traditional <b>Leaving</b> Certificate. Both <b>the</b> traditional <b>Leaving</b> Certificate and <b>the</b> <b>Leaving</b> Certificate Vocational Programme can lead to third-level education, with LCVP more focused on practical skills.|$|R

5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences that George felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is}} not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states that when <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally {{they can be}} effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E

50|$|The {{stability}} of <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group as an anion {{and the strength}} of its bind to the carbon atom both affect the rate of reaction. The more stable the conjugate base of <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group is, <b>the</b> more likely that it will take the two electrons of its bond to carbon during the reaction. Therefore, <b>the</b> weaker <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group is as a conjugate base, and thus the stronger its corresponding acid, <b>the</b> better <b>the</b> <b>leaving</b> group. Examples of good leaving groups are therefore the halides (except fluoride, due to its strong bond to the carbon atom) and tosylate, whereas HO− and H2N− are not.|$|R
5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> as can Nematodes.

These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
