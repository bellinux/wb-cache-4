5|$|At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack {{commenced}} with {{a preliminary}} bombardment. Manstein's main attack was delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which {{was composed of}} the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. <b>Though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still {{not been able to}} pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} Greg for hours, Leslie and Dave {{decide to}} go to Ann's party. They stop at the parks department to get Leslie's costume, {{only to find the}} office has been toilet papered and vandalized. Leslie immediately suspects Greg, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> watching him all night. Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning, but Greg insists he is innocent. Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an FBI agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.|$|E

Lawyers have notified competitors using the name to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz {{changed its name to}} the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} expands on enumerative combinatorics, or the {{systematic}} numeration of objects. It {{was in this}} part {{that two of the}} most important of the twelvefold ways—the permutations and combinations that would form the basis of the subject—were fleshed out, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> introduced earlier for the purposes of probability theory. He gives the first non-inductive proof of the binomial expansion for integer exponent using combinatorial arguments. On a note more distantly related to combinatorics, the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Neville {{was from}} the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was {{partially}} to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place {{was a result of}} the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.|$|E

25|$|A March 16 MONUC {{report found}} {{widespread}} illegal {{arrest and detention}} of minors, particularly street children and children associated with armed groups. Although the recruitment or retention of child soldiers is illegal, military authorities sometimes arrested demobilized child soldiers on charges of desertion and tried them in military courts. Civilian courts on occasion tried child soldiers for possessing illegal arms, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> illegally recruited as combatants.|$|E
25|$|The Isaurians were {{a people}} who lived inland from the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia, {{in the core of}} the Taurus Mountains (generally what is now the Konya/Bozkir area of Turkey). Like most {{borderland}} tribes, they were looked upon as barbarians by the Romans even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Roman subjects for more than five centuries. However, being Orthodox Christians rather than Arians, as the Goths and other Germanic tribes were, they were not formally barred from the throne.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-Émile Botta, {{began to}} search the vast mounds that lay along the {{opposite}} bank of the river. The locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon {{the ruins of a}} building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, {{turned out to be the}} royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.|$|E

25|$|By 1955, the {{new unit}} {{was ready for}} duty as the Royal Guards. Later renamed to their more {{familiar}} cognomen, Police Aerial Resupply Unit, or PARU. They were under the hidden patronage of the king even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> split away from the Royal Guards. They were deployed into mountainous northern Thailand to police the hill tribes there. They surreptitiously arrested bandits and opium smugglers while establishing ties to the tribesmen whom were despised by most Thais. During this time, many Hmong mentioned a promising young Hmong warrior in Laos named Vang Pao.|$|E
25|$|Various LSTs {{managed to}} move to safety under their own power or with {{assistance}} by tugboats. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, spreading fires, before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also spread fires to Tares 7 and 9 even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8. Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the spreading fires. One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from {{a collision course with}} an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot.|$|E
25|$|Aragorn possessed Elven wisdom – {{due to his}} {{childhood}} in Rivendell with Elrond – and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was a skilled healer, notably with the plant athelas (also known as Kingsfoil). He was a mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, he, Éomer and Imrahil were unscathed, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{in the thick of}} the fighting. Due to his position as Isildur's heir, Aragorn had impressive powers for a man, and, as the rightful owner of the palantír of Orthanc used it to declare himself as the heir of Isildur to Sauron, seeking to distract Sauron from Frodo.|$|E

25|$|When the French Revolution began, {{the colonel}} of the Condé-Dragons was François Jaucourt, who favoured the {{revolution}} and ended up joining the moderate Feuillant faction. On 31 August 1791, the regiment {{was one of the}} regular units called upon to suppress the Nancy Mutiny. On 1 January 1792, all the regiments of the French Army were given numbers in place of the names of their aristocratic patrons. The Condé-Dragons were designated the second-most senior dragoon regiment, and became the 2e régiment de dragons, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the eleventh-most senior dragoon regiment prior. Around this time, Jaucourt went into exile and command of the regiment briefly passed to Colonel Emmanuel de Grouchy, a future Marshal of France.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} power gradually {{shifted to the}} civil officials, while that of the nobility and military establishment waned, even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> important members of the ruling elite during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. The consequence was that eunuchs were unable to gather enough support to initiate projects opposed by the civil government. Civil officials would remain wary of the eunuchs' attempts to re-initiate the treasure voyages, because the latter continued to put forth suggestions for Ming emperors to emulate {{the achievements of the}} Yongle reign. However, no later emperor would seriously consider re-initiating the expeditions. The withdrawal of Ming China's treasure fleet left an enormous void in the foreign imperial dominance over the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Following {{relaxation}} {{of some of}} the specifications requirements, Blackburn constructed a second aircraft as a private venture, with a watertight metal monocoque fuselage replacing the previous steel tube fuselage, this first flying on 24 February 1933. Because it was a private venture it received and carried the Blackburn Class B civil test marking B-3 and was referred to as such, though it was also known as the M.1/30A. It performed poorly during testing, still being incapable of meeting the performance requirements of the specification even <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> relaxed, and being too heavy for the carrier deck lifts. As none of the competitors for the specification could meet its requirements, the specification was cancelled, with no aircraft being ordered.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, {{after they}} had made {{sufficient}} payments to compensate the landlords, this land would become their own private property. In the event, the reforms pleased neither nobles nor the ex-serfs. Though they were now free peasants, the ex-serfs were still subject to the heavy financial burden of paying rent and it usually took decades before {{they were able to}} buy the land for themselves. In other words, they were still dependent on the nobles, not legally, but economically. The nobles had accepted the emancipation only with extreme reluctance and, <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> more favourably treated than landowners in {{much of the rest of}} the empire, they had still lost some of their power and income. In the following years, both peasant and noble discontent would come to be expressed in new political movements in Georgia.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), {{commanded}} by David Henderson, was sent to France and was first used for aerial spotting in , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on [...] 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again only became effective the next year. In 1915 Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson and the RFC adopted an aggressive posture. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from , and interpreted by over 3,000 personnel.
