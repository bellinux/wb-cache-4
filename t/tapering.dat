50|$|The <b>tapered</b> key is <b>tapered</b> only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a <b>taper</b> that matches that of the <b>tapered</b> key. Some <b>taper</b> keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the <b>taper</b> is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with <b>taper</b> keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a <b>tapered</b> shaft lock in that <b>tapered</b> keys have a matching <b>taper</b> on the keyway, while <b>tapered</b> shaft locks do not.|$|R
50|$|<b>Taper</b> — The <b>taper</b> of a file {{refers to}} the gradual {{increase}} in diameter along its working surface.

40|$|Introduction. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the <b>taper</b> {{variation}} in root canal preparations among Twisted Files and PathFiles-ProTaper. 08 <b>tapered</b> rotary files to current standards. Methods. 60 root canals with severe angle of curvature (between 25 ∘ and 35 ∘) and short radius (< 10 [*]mm) were selected. The canals were divided randomly into two groups of 30 each. After preparation with Twisted Files and PathFiles-ProTaper to size 25 <b>taper.</b> 08, the diameter was measured using computed tomography (CT) at 1, 3, and 16 [*]mm. Canal <b>taper</b> preparation was calculated at the apical third and at the middle-cervical third. Results. Of the 2 file systems, both fell within the ±. 05 <b>taper</b> variability. All preparations demonstrated variability when compared to the nominal <b>taper.</b> 08. In the apical third, mean <b>taper</b> was significantly different between TF and PathFiles-ProTaper (value < 0. 0001; independent -test). Mean <b>Taper</b> was significantly higher with PathFile-ProTaper. In the middle-cervical third, mean <b>Taper</b> was significantly higher with TF (value = 0. 015; independent -test).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{complex-valued}} <b>taper</b> and derive {{the properties of}} a <b>tapered</b> Gaussian semiparametric estimator of the long-memory parameter d ÃÂÃÂ (- 0. 5, 1. 5). The estimator and its accompanying theory {{can be applied to}} generalized unit root testing. In the proposed method, the data are differenced once before the <b>taper</b> is applied. This guarantees that the <b>tapered</b> estimator is invariant with respect to deterministic linear trends in the original series. Any detrimental leakage effects due to the potential noninvertibility of the differenced series are strongly mitigated by the <b>taper.</b> The proposed estimator is shown to be more efficient than existing invariant <b>tapered</b> estimators. Invariance to kth order polynomial trends can be attained by differencing the data k times and then applying a stronger <b>taper,</b> which is given by the kth power of the proposed <b>taper.</b> We show that this new family of <b>tapers</b> enjoys strong efficiency gains over comparable existing <b>tapers.</b> Analysis of both simulated and actual data highlights potential advantages of the <b>tapered</b> estimator of d compared with the nontapered estimator. ...|$|R

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally.

The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes.

5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued <b>tapering</b> of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E

While {{a wealth}} of current {{literature}} exists to support {{the effectiveness of a}} training <b>taper</b> on athletic performance, no study has compared the sequencing of high intensity exercise bouts during the <b>taper</b> period. Purpose: To examine the effect of different sequences of high intensity exercise bouts on cycling time trial performance during a seven-day <b>taper.</b> Methods: 10 well-trained male cyclists age 24 - 48 underwent a VO 2 peak test to determine Wmax. Subjects were then counter-balanced to 1 of 2 groups following an opposite <b>taper</b> week order (<b>Taper</b> 1 - 2 or <b>Taper</b> 2 - 1). Each <b>taper</b> week was preceded by a seven-day training volume increase to 120 % of a subject???s self-reported weekly training volume. Both <b>taper</b> weeks utilized a 50 % reduction in training volume. <b>Taper</b> 1 consisted of a H|L|H|O|L|L|T sequence (H=High Intensity, L=Low Intensity, O=Day Off). <b>Taper</b> 2 consisted of a H|L|H|O|L|H|T sequence.
