5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. <b>The</b> <b>gait</b> of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E

50|$|The Peruvian Paso {{performs}} two {{variations of}} <b>the</b> four-beat <b>gait.</b> <b>The</b> first, the paso llano (a contraction of Paso Castellano), is , meaning {{that there are}} four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm. This is <b>the</b> preferred <b>gait.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>gait,</b> <b>the</b> sobreandando, is faster. Instead of four equal beats, the lateral beats are closer together in a 1-2, 3-4 rhythm, with the pause between the forefoot of {{one side to the}} rear of the other side is longer.|$|R

25|$|The {{lower leg}} should remain still when sitting the canter. If it moves, the rider is tense, or {{gripping}} with the thigh. The heel will sink down slightly and the knee angle may open with the footfalls, absorbing {{the shock of}} <b>the</b> <b>gait.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fox trot is {{most often}} {{associated}} with the Missouri Fox Trotter breed, but is also seen in other breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth ride said to also be sure-footed. <b>The</b> <b>gait</b> is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot {{on the ground at}} all times and display a sliding motion with the hind legs. Other gaited breeds are able to perform the fox trot and {{it is one of the}} only ambling gaits that can be taught to horses that are not naturally gaited. <b>The</b> <b>gait</b> creates an optical illusion that a horse is walking in front and trotting behind.|$|E
40|$|Locomotion in {{biological}} systems involves various gaits, and hysteresis appears when <b>the</b> <b>gaits</b> change {{in accordance with}} the locomotion speed. That is, <b>the</b> <b>gaits</b> vary at different locomotion speeds depending on the direction of speed change. Although hysteresis is a typical characteristic of nonlinear dynamic systems, the underlying mechanism for <b>the</b> hysteresis in <b>gait</b> transitions remains largely unclear. In this study, we construct a neuromechanical model of an insect and investigate the dynamic characteristics of its gait and <b>gait</b> transition. <b>The</b> simulation results show that our insect model produces metachronal and tripod <b>gaits</b> depending on <b>the</b> locomotion speed through dynamic interactions among the body mechanical system, the nervous system, and the environment in a self-organized manner. They also show that it undergoes <b>the</b> metachronal-tripod <b>gait</b> transition with hysteresis by changing the locomotion speed.

The patterns of force exerted in human walking and running minimize the work required of the muscles at each speed. Much of the energy that would otherwise be neededfor running, by people and other large mammals, is saved by tendon elasticity. 1...|$|R
25|$|The feet of H.nbsp&floresiensis were unusually {{flat and}} unusually long in {{relation}} {{with the rest of}} the body. As a result, when walking, it would have had to bend its knees further back than modern people do. This forced <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> to be high stepped and walking speed to be low.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{spectacular}} trace fossils are the huge, three-toed footprints produced by dinosaurs and related archosaurs. These imprints give scientists clues as to how these animals lived. Although the skeletons of dinosaurs can be reconstructed, only their fossilized footprints can determine exactly how they stood and walked. Such tracks can tell much about <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> of the animal which made them, what its stride was, {{and whether or not}} the front limbs touched the ground.|$|E

Soundness, balance and efficiency which accompany correct structure and good condition are crucial factors in their movement, not speed. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were bred to work all day on a farm and need stamina. They are a large breed; because of their history as farm dogs in mountainous terrain, they are extremely agile and this is apparent in their gait.|$|E

Using the traditional method, <b>the</b> optimal turning <b>gait</b> is a numerical solution. This paper proposes a geometric method to get <b>the</b> optimal turning <b>gait</b> which is <b>the</b> analytical solution.

25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> cycle. The computational method for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The rack or racking is a gait that is {{also known}} as the singlefoot or single-foot. It is an even, lateral four-beat gait. Although many breeds of horses are capable of {{producing}} this gait, it is most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In the rack, the speed of an even lateral slow gait is increased, while keeping the even intervals between each beat. In the American Saddlebred show ring, <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained, while the slow gait is expected be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also closely associated with the Racking Horse breed.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} by Frey & Riess {{became the}} dominant one, but was challenged in 2004 by Sanders, who showed experimentally that, whereas an alternate movement {{might have caused}} excessive pitching, a simultaneous movement would have caused only a slight pitch, {{which could have been}} easily controlled by the hind flippers. Of the other axial movements, rolling could have been controlled by alternately engaging the flippers of the right or left side, and yaw by the long neck or a vertical tail fin. Sanders did not believe that the hind pair was not used for propulsion, concluding that the limitations imposed by the hip joint were very relative. In 2010, Sanders & Carpenter concluded that, with an alternating gait, the turbulence caused by the front pair would have hindered an effective action of the hind pair. Besides, a long gliding phase after a simultaneous engagement would have been very energy efficient. It is also possible that <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> was optional and was adapted to the circumstances. During a fast steady pursuit, an alternate movement would have been useful; in an ambush, a simultaneous stroke would have made a peak speed possible. When searching for prey over a longer distance, a combination of a simultaneous movement with gliding would have cost the least energy. In 2017, a study by Luke Muscutt, using a robot model, concluded that the rear flippers were actively employed, allowing for a 60% increase of the propulsive force and a 40% increase of efficiency. The stroke would have been at its most powerful using a slightly alternating gait, the rear flippers engaging just after the front flippers, to benefit from their wake. However, there would not have been a single optimal phase for all conditions, <b>the</b> <b>gait</b> likely having been changed as the situation demanded.|$|E

40|$|The {{desirable}} conformation {{can vary}} depending {{on the use of the}} horse, as the conformation can give the horse the natural abilities for the wanted task. Therefor it is interesting to study which conformation traits that influence <b>the</b> <b>gaits.</b> In 2013 <b>the</b> Swedish warmblood Association introduced linear scoring of traits for the Swedish warmblood (SWB). This makes it possible to use the information to study correlations between different gait and conformation traits. The aim of this study was to analyze data from the linear scoring of three year old SWB horses to gain understanding of the conformation traits and their effect on <b>gait</b> characteristics. <b>The</b> question was; which conformation traits have an effect on <b>the</b> <b>gaits?</b> <b>The</b> hypothesis was that there are correlations between conformation and <b>gait</b> traits. For <b>the</b> study, information from linear scoring protocols of 1889 horses from year 2013 and 2014 was used. The data had been compiled in an Excel document. Two methods, Spearman ranks correlation and t-test, were used for analyses. The conformation traits used in this study were the position of the shoulder, body direction, body (uphill body type- downhill body type), the position of the neck, the shape of the neck, the length of the neck, the shape of the croup and the length of croup, and 16 traits of <b>the</b> horse <b>gaits</b> in walk, trot and canter. The result showed one moderate correlation (0. 48) between body direction and <b>the</b> <b>gaits</b> direction in movement and a total of 37 weak correlations (0. 20 - 0. 32) for all <b>the</b> conformation and <b>gait</b> traits except for the length and the shape of the croup where all the correlations were very weak. A sloping shoulder, an uphill body type horse and a vertical neck resulted in longer length of strides and uphill movements in <b>the</b> <b>gaits.</b> <b>The</b> hypothesis can be confirmed...|$|R

During the rhythmical auditory stimulation, stimulation was played back measure by measure, and was initiated by the patient's heel-strikes. Each condition received fifteen sessions of therapy. The results revealed that the rhythmical auditory stimulation group showed more improvement in stride length, symmetry deviation, walking speed and rollover path length (all indicators for improved walking gait) than the group that received traditional therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on {{the small of his back}} and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with <b>the</b> <b>gait.</b> (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber for the first time in this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.)

Indra tricked the king with six other duplicate images, but the king chose the right image which was later installed at Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur. The remaining six images were installed in Dharbaranyeswarar Temple, Kayarohanaswamy Temple, Kannayariamudayar Temple, Brahmapureeswarar Temple, Vaimoornaathar Temple and Tiruvarur Thyagaraja Temple. All seven Thyagaraja images are believed to possess different dance styles and the temples are classified as Saptha Vidangam, meaning temples with the seven dance moves.
