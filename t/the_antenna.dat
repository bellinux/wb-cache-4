5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to <b>the</b> <b>antenna,</b> deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside <b>the</b> <b>antenna,</b> which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground {{search of the}} area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control centre to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.

Bond sabotages <b>the</b> <b>antenna,</b> preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the cradle explodes, and falls, crushing and killing Trevelyan and destroying the base. Amazingly, Boris survives, but is frozen solid in a cascade of liquid nitrogen. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade {{and a team of}} Marines.|$|E

5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching.

5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design.

At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing <b>the</b> <b>antenna</b> downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower.

Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{studies the}} problem of {{distributed}} trans-mit beamforming with autonomous and self-organizing mobile <b>antennas.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to design a distributed algorithm for a network of autonomous mobile robots with carry-on antennas {{so that they can}} form a functional antenna array and cooperatively transmit messages to a remote station. Note that the spatial relationship of <b>the</b> <b>antennas</b> also contributes to the directionality of the reception or transmission of a signal. In the paper, by exploiting the mobility of <b>the</b> <b>antennas,</b> we show that optimal beamforming can be achieved by reconfiguring the spatial relationship of <b>the</b> mobile <b>antennas</b> in a completely distributed fashion. A probability-based coordination scheme utilizing only the signal-to-ratio (SNR) feedback from the receiver is presented to update the positions of <b>the</b> <b>antennas</b> ensuring that they eventually converge to a global optimal configuration maximizing the SNR at the receiver. It is noticed that the spatial configuration of <b>the</b> <b>antennas</b> can also address the phase synchronization issue in transmit beamforming...|$|R
5000|$|Antennas are {{characterized}} {{by a number of}} performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application. Chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) <b>antennas,</b> <b>the</b> gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. <b>The</b> <b>antenna's</b> power gain (or simply [...] "gain") also takes into account <b>the</b> <b>antenna's</b> efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit.|$|R
