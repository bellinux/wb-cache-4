5|$|Already in his {{lifetime}} his works were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>or</b> used him or his works as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz's novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given {{to a variety of}} products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.|$|E

5|$|Poniatowski {{has been}} the subject of {{numerous}} biographies and many works of art. Voltaire, who saw Poniatowski as a model reformist, modeled King Teucer in his drama Les Lois de Minos (1772) after him. At least 58 contemporary poems were dedicated <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> praised him. Since then, he has been a major character in many works of Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, in the Rok 1794 trilogy by Władysław Stanisław Reymont, in the novels of Tadeusz Łopalewski, and in the dramas of Ignacy Grabowski, Tadeusz Miciński, Roman Bradstaetter and Bogdan Śmigielski. He is discussed in Luise Mühlbach's novel Joseph II and His Court, and appears in Jane Porter's Thaddeus of Warsaw.|$|E

From his court {{on the island of}} Dragonstone, he sends a letter to all the corners of the Seven Kingdoms announcing that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella Baratheon are not Robert's true heirs, but rather the products of incest between Cersei Lannister and her twin brother Jaime. Stannis refuses to seek an alliance with Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, despite the advice of his advisor Ser Davos Seaworth, because he sees them as usurpers; Stannis insists that all will bend the knee <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|While no {{official}} knot exists for tying the two {{ends of the}} thong together, the decorative diamond knot {{has become the most}} common. When produced, the thong is joined by a simple overhand knot and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot, including: having a fellow course member tie it; having a mentor or course leader tie it; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has mastered the skills taught <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her during training.|$|E

5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness {{reminded him of his}} mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist {{and his or her}} best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her, asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.|$|E
5|$|Nafaryus hears a rumor about Gabriel {{being the}} savior of the people. He and his family travel to Ravenskill to see him for {{themselves}} ("Lord Nafaryus"). In the Ravenskill town square, Gabriel is performing for the people when the royal family shows up. He continues playing at the emperor's request ("A Savior in the Square"), nearly bringing them all to tears ("When Your Time Has Come"). As he plays, Faythe remembers how she found a music player {{when she was a}} child and kept it a secret all her life, and as she and Gabriel stare at each other and fall in love ("Act of Faythe"). Nafaryus, though briefly moved by Gabriel's song, sees him as a threat to his rule and gives the people of the town three days to deliver their savior <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> he will destroy the town ("Three Days"). Arhys hides his brother and refuses to give him up ("Brother, Can You Hear Me?").|$|E

5|$|The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is {{nominated}} by the President of the United States {{subject to approval}} of the US Senate, and reports <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> her and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually {{is associated with the}} President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump. Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.|$|E
5|$|When {{the attack}} fails, the {{terrorist}} leader decides to target Jagadish himself. He kills Jagadish's friend and asks Jagadish to surrender <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>or</b> else {{there would be}} more terrorist attacks. Jagadish decides to sacrifice his life and devises a plan with his fellow army men. Jagadish meets the leader in a ship, which has been rigged with a bomb planted by Jagadish's friend. When he learns about the leader's plan of infiltrating the Indian Army with sleeper agents {{with the help of a}} traitor in the Indian Defense— Kameeruddin IAS, the current deputy secretary, Jagadish decides to abandon his suicidal plan. He mocks the leader and compels him to a fight before escaping in a boat, with the leader as hostage. After the ship explodes, he kills the bewildered leader. Jagadish confronts Kameeruddin and forces him to commit suicide, before returning to Kashmir along with his fellow army men.|$|E
