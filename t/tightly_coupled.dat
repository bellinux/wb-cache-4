Although Gao et al. found that there was not one CpG methylation site that was more important than the others in downregulating H19 expression, they did find that the increase in CpG methylation in adrenal carcinomas followed the pattern of methylation of the normal, hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals. The mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs peaked at sites 9 and 10 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals and the lowest mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs dipped at site 7 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals.|$|E

40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} (CF) is {{a successful}} approach commonly used by many recommender systems. Conventional CF-based methods use the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation. However, the ratings are often very sparse in many applications, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which <b>tightly</b> <b>couples</b> the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. Inspired by recent success demonstrated by deep learning models, we propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model called collaborative deep learning (CDL), which <b>tightly</b> <b>couples</b> a Bayesian formulation of the stacked denoising autoencoder and probabilistic matrix factorization.

2500|$|The {{process of}} NHEJ {{involves}} XRCC4 {{and a number}} of <b>tightly</b> <b>coupled</b> proteins acting in concert to repair the DSB. [...] The system begins with the binding of one heterodimeric protein called Ku70/80 to each end of the DSB to maintain them close together in preparation for ligation and prevent their degradation. [...] Ku70/80 then sequesters one DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to the DNA ends to enable the binding of Artemis protein to one end of each DNA-PKcs. [...] One end of the DNA-PKcs joins to stabilize the proximity of the DSB and allow very short regions of DNA complementarity to hybridize. [...] DNA-PKcs then phosphorylates Artemis at a serine/threonine to activate its exonuclease activity and cleave nucleotides at the single strand tails that are not hybridized in a 5’ to 3’ direction. [...] Two XRCC4 proteins are post-translationally modified for recognition and localization to Ku70/80 (5). [...] The two XRCC4 proteins dimerize together and bind to Ku70/80 at the ends of the DNA strands to promote ligation. [...] XRCC4 then forms a strong complex with DNA ligase IV, LigIV, which is enhanced by Cernunnos XRCC4-like factor, Cer-XLF. [...] Cer-XLF only binds to XRCC4 without direct interaction with LigIV. [...] LigIV then joins the DNA ends by catalyzing a covalent phosphodiester bond.|$|E
