5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E

5000|$|Witches of East End (2013-14) {{was noted}} by critics for its strong {{resemblance}} <b>to</b> <b>Charmed,</b> as both shows {{are about a}} sisterhood of witches battling evil and live in similar houses, which its executive producer Maggie Friedman has acknowledged. Other witch-themed shows that have been compared <b>to</b> <b>Charmed</b> include The Secret Circle (2011-12) and Hex (2004-05), which {{has been described as}} [...] "the U.K.'s edgier, oversexed response to Charmed." [...] Eastwick (2009) was noted for its surface similarities <b>to</b> <b>Charmed</b> as it also focused on a trio of female witches, which led to the show's pilot director David Nutter to say that Eastwick was not a clone of Charmed. The season four episode of Smallville titled [...] "Spell" [...] also received comparisons <b>to</b> <b>Charmed</b> as it focused on three of its main female characters, who get possessed by a trio of 16th Century witches.|$|R

25|$|He was not keen on sport, {{but he was}} {{a highly}} {{proficient}} dancer. Fisher employed his dancing skill later in life <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> a number of important ladies. He became interested in dancing in 1877 and insisted that the officers of his ship learn to dance. Fisher cancelled the leave of midshipmen who would not take part. He introduced the practice of junior officers dancing on deck when the band was playing for senior officers' wardroom dinners. This practice spread through the fleet. He broke with the then ball tradition of dancing with a different partner for each dance, instead adopting the scandalous habit of choosing one good dancer as his partner for the evening. His ability <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> all comers of all social classes made up for his sometimes blunt or tactless comments. He suffered from seasickness throughout his life.|$|E

25|$|In the boardroom, it was {{revealed}} that Tom Lewis had actually felt his art would sell better on Brick Lane, but chose Revolution because of how Kirsty had handled the meeting with him. Not only was she sent alone by Tim to conduct the negotiations, she also failed <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> him and paid little attention to his artwork, instead focusing entirely on figures. Lord Sugar remarked that the team's loss was purely down to losing Lewis and that Kirsty held responsibility for this.|$|E

Klaus Baer recalled her piety when she accompanied him on a visit to Sakkara in the early 1950s, when she brought an offering and took off her shoes before entering Unas' pyramid. She continued to report apparitions and out-of-body experiences during this time, which caused friction with the upper-middle-class family she had married into.|$|E

By a quick-witted ruse she manages to kill him instead, and in many versions she is helped to keep this experience from her parents by a resourceful parrot. The main variant has been collected frequently from traditional singers in England, Scotland, Ireland and North America.|$|E

25|$|Flying carpets are rugs, {{that are}} enchanted {{with the ability}} to fly. Flying Carpets were once an {{accepted}} form of travel for the British magical community, but they are banned due to being defined as a Muggle Artefact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. It is therefore against British wizarding law <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> carpets or fly them, although they are still legal in other countries. Mr. Weasley was heavily involved in the introduction of this legislation due to his position in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. It is revealed that the ban was relatively recent, not only due to Mr. Weasley's involvement, but also because Barty Crouch's grandfather owned and operated a 12-seater Axminster before flying carpets were prohibited.|$|E
25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to the stove god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god {{on a piece of paper}} above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E

Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) to the music of the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt <b>to</b> <b>charm</b> Kim Deal, and speak to her sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E
