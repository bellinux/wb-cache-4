40|$|The {{effects of}} error masking {{in a number}} of {{signature}} registers are analyzed. It is shown that a self-test can always be scheduled such that evaluating signatures only {{at the end of the}} complete test execution is sufficient. A method for computing the probability of a fault leading to at least one faulty signature in a set of self-test registers is presented. This method allows the computation of the fault coverage with respect to the complete test execution. A minimal subset of all self-test registers can be selected so that only the signatures of these self-test registers have to be evaluated and the fault coverage is almost not affected. The benefits of this approach are a smaller number of self-test registers in the scan path, a smaller number of signatures to be evaluated, a simplified <b>test</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> and hence a significant reduction in tie hardware required for built-in self-test structures.

The advantage of the use of LED technology resides in several factors such as the reducing of the analyte temperature variations and thus noise generation, which occur if a Xenon light source is used, beside of the high luminous efficiency, reliability, operating duration, lower maintenance and a lower power consumption. This last factor allows to supply the entire designed apparatus using a solar panel thus making the system easly portable for use even in places where the electricity network is absent.

This thesis presents different approach of using HIL simulations. Active and passive mechanical loads can be simulated physically on direct drive motors, under computer control. The work in thesis is based on effort-flow concept, which allows components of the experimental setup to be replaced as needed by physical or digital model. The only requirement {{that has to be}} satisfied is that elements of the setup retain their inputs and outputs, in the form of effort and flow pairs. Based on this theory, the new experimental setup was built, a generic HIL setup containing two DC motors, which are connected by shaft. One of the motors is used to actuate the system, while another motor represents the physical simulator. Based on the sets of derived formulas, physical simulator is able to simulate active and passive loads. Three different experimental levels are presented in the thesis. The open loop, current control and torque control experiments. The experimental results prove the concept in whole and show that theory can be applied in real world applications.

Was the Windfall Profits Tax enacted by Jimmy Carter in 1980 as beneficial to consumers as proclaimed? At the time, what did the public perceive to be the major causes of the crisis?

The main {{reason for this is that}} many people who make decisions in these cases are either consumed by their own ambitions-whose goals are contradictory to the long-term interest of the people, or they lack familiarity with principles with which knowledge is required to make optimal decisions.
