30|$|As an {{important}} wide band n-type semiconductor, SnO 2 possesses many unique optical and electrical properties {{which have been}} widely used in optoelectronic devices and gas sensors [1 â€“ 4]. One dimensional (1 -D) SnO 2 have been reported to have some different characteristics from the bulk crystal due to its large surface-to-volume ratio [5]. Nanodevices based on 1 -D SnO 2 nanostructures have been fabricated and showed significant potential for applications ranging from field-effect transistors, gas sensors, displays, as well as solar cells [6 â€“ 9]. Although promising results of the gas sensing and other performance of 1 -D SnO 2 have been reported, the development of highly sensitized devices remains a future challenge. Usually, the surface atoms and states on the (1 -D) SnO 2 surface play {{an important}} role in its transport behavior which complicates the nanodevice characterization [10]. Recent research result showed that the surface states indeed existed in these wires which could be detected in a contactless manner by spectral analysis [11]. Thus the better understanding of the surface states affected the device <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> needed. The <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> of the nanobelts device and the surface states on the (1 -D) SnO 2 surface must be cared in order to fabricate the practical application of nanodevices. It is difficult for us investigating the <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> of one single nanobelt in the nanometer scale before atomic force microscopy (AFM), especially the conductive AFM (C-AFM) with a conductive tip; in recent years, more and more are used to investigate the <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> and the surface property on the nanostructure in microscope scales [12 â€“ 15]. AFM tip coated with metal can serve as the conducting electrode, and the <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> of the nanowires can be studied through the I-V curve recorded by C-AFM technique [16]. Furthermore, the current image, simultaneously with the AFM topography, can provide the direct information how the current flows through the nanostructure surface [17, 18]. In this paper, singe SnO 2 nanobelt device is assembled across opposing Au electrodes by electric-field assembly method [19]. Nonlinear and asymmetric I-V curve are obtained by applying a small voltage onto the conductive AFM tip positioned directly on the surface of SnO 2 nanobelt. We conclude the nonlinear and asymmetric I-V behavior resulted from the back-to-back Schottky barriers between AFM tip/SnO 2 nanobelt/electrode, and the Schottky barriers is related to the surface states on the nanobelt surface. The current images of the nanobelt device are also studied by C-AFM techniques, which show the current flow through the single nanobelt devices clearly. The results showed that the surface states can affect the <b>transport</b> <b>property</b> of the nanobelt device and display stripe patterns in the current images.|$|E
