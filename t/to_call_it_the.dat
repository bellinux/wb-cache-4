5|$|Noted filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as {{a notable}} {{achievement}} in cinema; Eisenstein {{went so far}} as <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> greatest film ever made. The film inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy film, The Wizard of Oz, in 1939. Another animation pioneer, Max Fleischer, decided to produce his animated feature film Gulliver's Travels in order to compete with Snow White. The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, directed by Bob Clampett, parodies Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.|$|E

When it was learned that Dodge had already reserved the Diplomat {{name for a}} planned two-door hardtop body style, Nash delved into its own past, and resurrected the Rambler name from an 1897 prototype and its first production model, in 1902.

Not only did Harder further deplete the critical supply of destroyers by sinking {{four of them}} and heavily damaging or destroying another one in four days, but her frequent attacks and a rash of enemy contact reports on this fleeting marauder so frightened Admiral Soemu Toyoda that he believed Tawi-Tawi surrounded by submarines. As a result, Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet departed Tawi-Tawi a day ahead of schedule. The premature departure upset the Japanese battle plans, and forced Ozawa to delay his carrier force in the Philippine Sea, thus contributing to the stunning defeat suffered by the Japanese in the ensuing battle.|$|E

The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, {{said it was an}} amazing partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons Game and not add a subtitle was because they felt it was a restart of [...] "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".|$|E

In 1994, Selena released Amor Prohibido, which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it {{became one of the most}} popular Latin music subgenres at the time. Amor Prohibido has been ranked among the most essential Latin recordings of the past 50 years by Billboard magazine while the publication nominated it for its list of the top 100 albums of all-time.

The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. The Ministry not only took great measures to explain that both symbols are not formally established by law, they also referred to [...] "Kimigayo" [...] as a song and refused <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> national anthem. It was not until 1977 that the Ministry referred to [...] "Kimigayo" [...] as the national anthem ( [...] , kokka) of Japan. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the Hinomaru flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect {{must be given to}} it and to [...] "Kimigayo".

500|$|Billingsley's {{original}} {{plan for the}} Cub Room was {{for it to be}} a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends. The room was added to the club during World War II. Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space, but it was Walter Winchell who began <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Cub Room. The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a [...] "lopsided oval". The room was lit with pink tones. [...] On the wood-paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the ladies' powder room. After the club's labor problems began in 1957, Billingsley redecorated the entire club, choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs, and a pinkish-red for the banquettes. The Cub Room's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th-century race horses. As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork, the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time. The sanctum sanctorum, the Cub Room ("the snub room"), was guarded by a captain called [...] "Saint Peter" [...] (for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven).|$|E
500|$|The electoral {{success of}} the Vlaams Blok began after the younger {{generation}} in the party shifted the party's emphasis from Flemish nationalism (separatism) to the immigration issue. In the 1988 local election in Antwerp the party first started to take off, going from 5.5% {{of the vote in}} the city to 17.7%, a success which drew much publicity. On 10 May 1989, based on the Antwerp success, the presidents of all major Belgian parties (including the People's Union) signed a cordon sanitaire (hygienic barrier), where the parties agreed to never conclude any political agreements with the Vlaams Blok, nor make immigration a political issue. While the Vlaams Blok itself also largely rejected cooperation with other parties, it did increasingly consider such cooperation, particularly in elections in 1994, 1999 and 2000, only to find themselves effectively blocked by the cordon sanitaire. Although intended to keep the Vlaams Blok from gaining political influence, many argued that the agreement in reality gave room for the strong electoral surge for the party, as it was made into what could be seen as the only [...] "true opposition."

He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I always like <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>The</b> African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet {{wanted to work with}} Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004).

The two singles [...] "I Will Possess Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Cath..." [...] both reached the top ten of the Alternative Songs chart, while [...] "Grapevine Fires" [...] reached number 21.

[...] Indeed, Narrow Stairs was nominated for [...] "Best Alternative Music Album" [...] and [...] "I Will Possess Your Heart" [...] received a nomination for [...] "Best Rock Song" [...] at the 51st Grammy Awards. The band lost in both categories, but prompted debate after appearing at the ceremony sporting blue ribbons to protest against what they view as the excessive use of Auto-Tune in the music industry.

Entertainment website Holy Moly named the series {{one of the best}} shows during the 2012–13 season, writing that [...] "this final season of The Office has been great" [...] largely {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every single relationship in the show rings true with the audience." [...] Michael Tedder of Vulture commented that he was [...] "willing <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> fourth best season of the show overall, which is by no means faint praise." [...] He explained that this was largely due to the fact that the [...] "final season was a chance to see how everyone else would end up". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "the tension between Jim and Pam in the final season ended up being highly controversial for a number of reasons... but it also provided the most hopeful moments of the series' final stretch" [...] (although he did note that it was clear that the writers had [...] "blatantly" [...] set up the drama). He concluded that the finale was able to successfully return the series [...] "to what had always been its heart—to have true fulfillment". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the season an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] year. She felt that the character growth in the final few episodes was particularly well executed, and the last stretch of the season helped raise it after a rocky start; ultimately, she felt that the writers were able to craft the proper ending for the show. She was, however, critical of Andy's characterization, noting that he was merely used as a plot device when convenient. Many critics argued that the season was an improvement, in both writing and humor, over the previous season.|$|E
