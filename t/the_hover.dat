5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, <b>the</b> <b>hover</b> cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. <b>The</b> <b>Hover</b> nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with <b>the</b> <b>Hover</b> nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

25|$|In this {{configuration}} most of {{the bypass}} flow is ducted to the wing nozzles, known as roll posts.

25|$|A higher {{bypass ratio}} {{increases}} the thrust {{for the same}} engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F-135 is in <b>the</b> <b>hover</b> using its increased bypass ratio, the thrust augmentation decreases to 50% with no increase in fuel flow. Thrust augmentation increases to 52% in horizontal flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in fuel flow.|$|E

During 1953 it was evaluated by the Royal Air Force (using serial number XF785) and also carried out sea trials for the Royal Navy on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle.

25|$|Common {{procedure}} {{was that the}} secondary helicopter escorted a heavily damaged primary helicopter back to base, but Kennedy was asked to return to continue the pickup attempts of the F-4 backseater, Tempest 03B, Kennedy's first actual attempt at combat rescue. On the first try, his aircraft was hit and both enlisted men slightly wounded. The HH-3E was driven off by fire four times, taking more battle damage on each pass. Despite deteriorating weather conditions, a rupture in their forward fuel tank, and smoke in the aircraft, Kennedy's three crewmen joined him in wanting to try again. In the poor weather, Williamson noted that better reference points were {{on the left side}} of the aircraft and urged that Lt. Harris conduct <b>the</b> <b>hover.</b>|$|E
25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional cyclic stick, collective lever and rudder pedals the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in <b>the</b> <b>hover</b> or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on rotor disc angle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Information Hovering is a {{relatively}} new concept of information dissemination over a mobile set of peers. It naturally applies in many applications in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, where useful information needs to be made available to all vehicles within a confined geographical area for a specific time interval. A straightforward approach, is to have all vehicles within <b>the</b> <b>hovering</b> area exchange messages with each other. However, this method does not guarantee that all vehicles within <b>the</b> <b>hovering</b> area will receive the message due to potential parti-tioning of the network in areas with low traffic density and/or low market penetration rate. In this work, we address the problem by applying probabilistic flooding schemes outside <b>the</b> <b>hovering</b> area. Informed vehicles outside <b>the</b> <b>hovering</b> area can serve as information bridges towards partitioned uninformed areas thus leading to high reachability. We consider a number of rebroadcast probability functions and we evaluate their performance using the microscopic simulation tool VISSIM. Our reference model represents a section of the road network in the cities of Bellevue and Redmond in Washington. The obtained results indicate that probabilistic flooding with a Gaussian like probability function outperforms other approaches by achieving high reachability values and {{a relatively}} small number of exchanged messages.
