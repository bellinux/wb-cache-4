5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men and <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> piety and an active religious life {{may have been}} more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons.

One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible.

Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor.

Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced {{by most of the}} nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
