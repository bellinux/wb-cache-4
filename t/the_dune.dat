5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dune,</b> {{limestone}} {{and salt}} lake vegetation communities on North Island {{are considered to}} have high conservation significance. <b>The</b> <b>dune</b> and limestone communities have high biodiversity, are highly sensitive to disturbance and regenerate slowly. The salt lake community is considered significant because of the rarity of salt lakes on offshore islands.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|The Algodones Dunes, which border old Cahuilla shorelines, {{were formed}} by sand blown from Lake Cahuilla. This theory was first {{formulated}} in 1923. The process occurred either {{immediately after the}} lake reached modern highstands, or during earlier higher stands. Most likely, sand was transported to <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> field during times where the lake receded and its bed was exposed to wind. Various stages of Lake Cahuilla may correspond to waves of migrating dunes.|$|E
50|$|The {{dramatic}} {{appearance of}} <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> near Samalayuca, visible from Highway 45, has generated tourism interest in <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b> This includes adventure tourism. Tourists hike in <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> ride over them in various vehicles, and slide down <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> on sand boards.|$|R
50|$|Several fossils {{were found}} at <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> from {{sediment}} {{at the bottom of}} the water. Fossil sea shells and coral reefs can be seen today at <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b> <b>The</b> wind and water constantly change and reform <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b> <b>The</b> wind forces the sand to drop and form a pile, also known as a sand dune. Not many plants make it in <b>the</b> sand <b>dune</b> but <b>the</b> marram grass can survive the winds and water of <b>the</b> <b>dunes.</b>|$|R

5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. <b>The</b> <b>dune</b> tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. <b>The</b> <b>dune</b> vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs {{and follows}} the cliff top past several small bays {{including}} Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse, into Rackham Bay. It then rounds Morte Point, passing the nearby village of Mortehoe before turning south {{to enter the}} long sandy Morte Bay which includes Woolacombe and Putsborough. Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from Croyde Bay, and the surfing mecca of Croyde and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay, which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wide expanse of Saunton Sands, which {{takes its name from}} Saunton, merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest), the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs, and <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> slacks are also rich. The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> are <b>the</b> {{product of}} erosion {{in the coastal}} {{hinterland}} and coastal <b>dune</b> forming processes. <b>The</b> extensive <b>dune</b> system covers an area of 650 hectares and comprises a series of parabolic sand <b>dunes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> range from 2060 m tall. <b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> have been forming over thousands of years.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> contain {{multiple}} burial sites. <b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> were fenced off {{to reduce}} foot traffic and exclude invasive predators. Thereafter endangered bird species began to nest on <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> {{acting as a}} natural vector and fertilizer for native plants.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> have {{frequently}} been {{a barrier to}} human movement in the area. Foot travelers frequently diverted south into Mexico, and in 1877 the Southern Pacific Railroad was diverted north to avoid <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> but in 1915 Colonel Ed Fletcher built a wooden plank road across <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> to prove that cars could cross <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> and to connect San Diego with Yuma, Arizona. This trail eventually became part of Interstate 8. During World War II, the U.S. military conducted desert warfare training on <b>the</b> <b>dunes,</b> which {{were part of the}} California-Arizona Maneuver Area. People have been driving on <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> for recreation almost since vehicles first reached the area, which may have been the proving ground for <b>the</b> first <b>dune</b> buggy, a modified Ford Model A. Off-road driving surged following World War II when surplus Jeeps became available to the public.|$|R
5|$|The {{shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> {{depends on the}} {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a pile of tires. She and her dancers return to <b>the</b> <b>dune</b> and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E

50|$|Near Copiapó in the {{southern}} reaches of the Atacama Desert <b>the</b> largest <b>dunes</b> of Chile exists. Based on an analysis of sediments {{it has been suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> derive from fluvial sediments.

At present <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> are active but starved of sediment supply.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dunes</b> {{are formed}} from {{the erosion of}} pink-colored Navajo Sandstone {{surrounding}} the park. High winds passing through the notch between the Moquith and Moccasin Mountains pick up loose sand particles and then drop them onto <b>the</b> <b>dunes</b> because of <b>the</b> Venturi effect. <b>The</b> <b>dunes</b> {{are estimated to be}} between 10,000 and 15,000 years old.|$|R
