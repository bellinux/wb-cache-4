25|$|Language {{documentation}} combines anthropological inquiry (into {{the history}} and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics {{is concerned with the}} statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation,</b> as well as in language education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.|$|E

Apart from Vargsmål, {{this is the only}} other book that was published. In 2004 he {{translated}} it into English, added new material, and renamed it The Mysteries and Mythology of Ancient Scandinavia. In 1999 he wrote EihwaR, a [...] "philosophical/political/historical novel in form of a dialogue between a student and an oppositional". This too he translated into English and renamed The Religion of the Blood. That year he also wrote a Norwegian and English <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Völuspá. In 2000–2001 he wrote Teorier ("Theories"). It offered some theories on the origin of different customs and beliefs, and contained several short stories about the prehistoric era. However, he decided to scrap this book. In 2003–2004 he wrote a [...] "gothic-fantasy novel" [...] called The Cult of Hel. By late 2003 he had begun writing articles for Burzum.org, which became the official Burzum website.|$|E
2500|$|From {{his early}} research, Sahagún wrote the text known as Primeros Memoriales. This {{served as the}} basis for his subsequent, larger Historia General. [...] He {{conducted}} his research at Tepeapulco, approximately 50miles northeast of Mexico City, near present-day Hidalgo. There he spent two years interviewing approximately a dozen village elders in Nahuatl, assisted by native graduates of the college at Tlatelolco. Sahagún questioned the elders about the religious rituals and calendar, family, economic and political customs, and natural history. He interviewed them individually and in groups, and was thus able to evaluate the reliability of the information shared with him. His assistants spoke three languages (Nahuatl, Latin and Spanish). They participated in research and documentation, <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and they also painted illustrations. [...] He published their names, described their work, and gave them credit. The pictures in the Primeros Memoriales convey a blend of indigenous and European artistic elements and influences. [...] Analysis of Sahagún's research activities in this earlier period indicates that he was developing and evaluating his own methods for gathering and verifying this information.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2007, a New York Times op-ed {{article by}} April DeConick {{asserted}} that the National Geographics translation is badly flawed: For example, in one instance the National Geographic transcription refers to Judas as a [...] "daimon," [...] which the society’s experts have translated as [...] "spirit." [...] However, the universally accepted word for [...] "spirit" [...] is [...] "pneuma" [...] — in Gnostic literature [...] "daimon" [...] is always taken to mean [...] "demon." [...] The National Geographic Society responded that [...] "Virtually all issues April D. DeConick raises about translation choices are addressed in footnotes in both the popular and critical editions." [...] In a later review of the issues and relevant publications, critic Joan Acocella questioned whether ulterior intentions had not begun to supersede historical analysis, e.g., whether publication of The Gospel of Judas could {{be an attempt to}} roll back ancient anti-semitic imputations. She concluded that the ongoing clash between scriptural fundamentalism and attempts at revision were childish because of the unreliability of the sources. Therefore, she argued, [...] "People interpret, and cheat. The answer is not to fix the Bible but to fix ourselves." [...] Other scholars have questioned the initial <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Gospel of Judas by the National Geographic team of experts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, as a Professor at Cornell, Allan Bloom {{served as}} a faculty member of the Cornell Branch of the Telluride Association, an {{organization}} focused on intellectual development and self-governance.

While living at the house, Bloom befriended former U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. Bloom's first book was a collection of three essays on Shakespeare's plays, Shakespeare's Politics; it included an essay from Harry V. Jaffa. He translated and commented upon Rousseau's [...] "Letter to M. D'Alembert on the Theater", bringing it into dialogue with Plato's Republic. In 1968, he published his most significant work of philosophical <b>translation</b> <b>and</b> <b>interpretation,</b> a translation of Plato's Republic. Bloom strove to achieve [...] "translation... for the serious student". [...] The preface opens on page xi with the statement, [...] "this is intended to be a literal translation".

He repeated this effort as {{a professor of political science}} at the University of Toronto in 1978, translating Jean-Jacques Rousseau's [...] Among other publications during his years of teaching was a reading of Swift's Gulliver's Travels, titled [...] "Giants and Dwarfs"; it became the title for a collection of essays on, among others, Raymond Aron, Alexandre Kojève, Leo Strauss, and liberal philosopher John Rawls.
