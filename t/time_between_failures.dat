40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{practical issues}} in the statistical analysis of component aging data. These issues center on the stochastic process chosen to model component failures. However, the paper also discusses practical issues related to parameter estimation and model validation. The two stochastic processes examined are repair same as new, leading to a renewal process, and repair same as old, leading to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Under the first assumption, <b>times</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> can treated as statistically independent observations from a stationary process. The common distribution of the <b>times</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> is called the renewal distribution. Under the second process, the <b>times</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures</b> will not be independently and identically distributed, and one cannot simply fit a renewal distribution to the cumulative failure times or the <b>times</b> <b>between</b> <b>failures.</b> The paper illustrates how the assumption made regarding the repair process {{is crucial to the}} analysis. The paper uses modern Bayesian computational techniques, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and freely available open-source software packages. Besides the choice of stochastic process, other issues that are discussed include qualitative graphical analysis and simple nonparametric hypothesis tests to help judge which process appears more appropriate, quantitative parameter estimation for both processes, and Bayesian model validation using the posterior predictive distribution. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the issues discussed in the paper. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R

While checkpointing provides benefits in a variety of situations, it is especially useful in highly parallel systems with a large number of processors used in high performance computing.|$|E

The costs to cannibalize a T 7 OO-GE- 4 O 1 C engine, a tail rotor blade and an auxiliary power electronic control unit were calculated by assigning a dollar value to the increased manpower, consumables and flight time that could have been avoided if cannibalization were not used. The units cannibalized in 1996 were tracked by serial number through 1999 to compare their mean <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> to similar non-cannibalized units for the same period The findings were that cannibalization considerably decreases the <b>time</b> <b>between</b> <b>failure</b> for cannibalized components which can have reaching effects on the size and costs of the Navy's inventory of spare parts. The increased manpower, consumables and flight time required has a significant impact on an operational squadron's workforce and budget. Outstanding Thesi...|$|R
