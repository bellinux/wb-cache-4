5|$|Astronomer Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and {{the dwarf}} planets , , and , <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> {{it is the}} most scientifically {{important}} trans-Neptunian object found to date, because understanding its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Brown put {{the odds}} for the {{existence}} of Planet Nine at about 90%. Greg Laughlin, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this paper, gives an estimate of 68.3%. Other skeptical scientists demand more data in terms of additional KBOs to be analysed or final evidence through photographic confirmation. Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> there is enough data to mount a search for a new planet.|$|E

5|$|Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva, a cadet who, {{contrary}} to Lasky's beliefs, {{is a full}} supporter of {{the war against the}} insurrectionists. Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience.|$|E
40|$|Some Nietzsche scholars, like Wilcox and Kaufmann, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> for Nietzsche {{there are}} truths and that {{knowledge}} {{of them is}} possible. 1 I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this reading is correct. Other scholars, like Danto and Cameron, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche rejects the possibility of truth. In my opinion they are correct, but they also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this rejection gives rise to serious difficulties in Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s thought. 2 I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche was aware of these difficulties, consciously sought to get around them, and that his most bizarre doctrines, if understood correctly, succeed in do- ing so...|$|R

5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes.

The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains are shaking, she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E

5|$|Njörðr is {{referenced}} in stanza 22 of {{the poem}} Þrymskviða, where he {{is referred to as}} the father of the goddess Freyja. In the poem, the jötunn Þrymr mistakenly <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> he will be receiving the goddess Freyja as his bride, and while telling his fellow jötunn to spread straw on the benches in preparation for the arrival of Freyja, he refers to her as the daughter of Njörðr of Nóatún. Towards the end {{of the poem}} Sólarljóð, Njörðr is cited as having nine daughters. Two of the names of these daughters are given; the eldest Ráðveig and the youngest Kreppvör.|$|E

Soon Shevraeth openly opposes King Galdran, and accompanies the Astiars to fight the royal forces. They kill Galdran, ending the war and creating opportunity {{for a change in}} power in Remalna. Bran, who has gradually befriended Shevraeth, goes to court with him while Mel returns to Tlanth.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E
