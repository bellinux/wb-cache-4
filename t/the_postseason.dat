5|$|As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' {{rivalry with}} the Boston Red Sox {{increased}} in intensity as the sides met multiple {{times in the}} American League Championship Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached <b>the</b> <b>postseason,</b> but were often defeated {{in the first two}} rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record. The furthest the Yankees have gone in <b>the</b> <b>postseason</b> since then is the ALCS, in 2010, 2012, and 2017.|$|E

Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during <b>the</b> <b>postseason,</b> and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not hold opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
5|$|Nashville reached <b>the</b> <b>postseason</b> during six {{of their}} seven {{seasons in the}} Southern League. They won three Western Division titles and two Southern League Championships. The Sounds' 13years with the American Association at the Triple-A level was a vast contrast. The Sounds only managed three trips to <b>the</b> <b>postseason,</b> {{including}} two by virtue of winning the Eastern Division title. Though they did not perform well during their first few years with the Pacific Coast League, the team {{went on to win}} four division titles, two American Conference titles, and one Pacific Coast League Championship between 2003 and 2007. The Sounds did not qualify again for postseason play until 2016 when they won the American Conference Southern Division title.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{left before}} his final year at Auburn and made himself {{eligible}} for the 1984 NBA draft. He was selected with the fifth pick {{in the first round}} by the Philadelphia 76ers, two slots after the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael Jordan. He joined a veteran team that included Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Maurice Cheeks, players who took Philadelphia to the 1983 NBA championship. Under the tutelage of Malone, Barkley was able to manage his weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game. He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team. In <b>the</b> <b>postseason,</b> the Sixers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals but were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics.

5|$|In 1966, {{the team}} moved from Milwaukee {{to its current}} location, Atlanta. Its first manager in Atlanta was Bobby Bragan, who managed the team for three seasons earlier in Milwaukee.

Harris led the team into the NL Championship Series (NLCS) in 1969, but failed to advance into the World Series. Joe Torre was the next manager to manage the Braves into <b>the</b> <b>postseason,</b> but like Harris, led the team into the NLCS with a losing result. Bobby Cox was the manager of the Braves from 1990 till 2010. Under his {{leadership}} the Braves made <b>the</b> <b>postseason</b> 15 times, winning five National League championships and one World Series title in 1995.
