5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> is extremely rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> along the line was extremely rough and mountainous thanks to the Taebaek Mountains which ran from north to south down Korea's east coast. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along the South Korean line <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter using <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces.|$|E

50|$|Dengdeng {{waterfall}} has 3 <b>terrains.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>terrain</b> stands about 13 Meter high, {{while the}} second and <b>the</b> third <b>terrain</b> stands around 11 and 9 Meter high. From <b>the</b> first <b>terrain,</b> {{you can see the}} stream of Cikembang river with the paddy fieds and coconut trees around it. On <b>the</b> second <b>terrain,</b> you can enjoy the beauty of the waterfall in <b>the</b> first <b>terrain.</b> Usually there are many tourists who take a bath or enjoy the fresh water in this <b>terrain.</b> While at <b>the</b> third level, you can enjoy <b>the</b> whole <b>terrain</b> of waterfall. Under the last waterfall, there is a big pool with fresh and clear water in which tourists are allowed to bathe.|$|R

40|$|The {{surface of}} the {{southern}} hemisphere of Miranda imaged by Voyager 2 is divisible into two general types of terrain: cratered terrain, characterized by numerous craters and undulating intercrater plains; and basins, circular to rectangular areas of complex morphology having large-scale albedo markings. To determine the relative ages of <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> and <b>the</b> length of geological activity, crater-frequency data were compiled for various parts of <b>the</b> cratered <b>terrain</b> and basins. Crater-frequency data indicate that <b>the</b> cratered <b>terrain</b> is <b>the</b> oldest <b>terrain</b> on Miranda {{and that it was}} locally resurfaced...|$|R

5|$|As SR 89A {{moves to}} the northeast, it begins to ascend the Black Hills {{mountain}} range. The roadway follows <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> {{through a series of}} hairpin turns as it climbs in elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.|$|E
5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> {{east of the}} airport. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Both Memphis and Randolph {{are located}} {{on one of the}} four Chickasaw Bluffs, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> of the Chickasaw Bluffs {{provided}} promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54.|$|E
40|$|Light {{and dark}} terrains {{in and around}} Meridiani Sinus, mapped on the imagery from Mariner 6 and Mariner 7, {{were found to have}} {{significantly}} different cumulative size frequency distributions of craters. <b>The</b> light <b>terrain</b> on a mosaic of frames 6 N 11, 6 N 13, and 6 N 19 has a greater proportion of large craters and a lesser proportion of smaller craters than <b>the</b> dark <b>terrain</b> on <b>the</b> same frames. <b>The</b> light <b>terrain</b> is interpreted to be generally older than <b>the</b> dark <b>terrain.</b> <b>The</b> filling or partial filling of the smaller craters on <b>the</b> light <b>terrain</b> by surface detritus is suggested. Several wide-angle frames have remarkably similar cumulative crater size frequency distributions that may be representative of {{a large portion of the}} Martian surface...|$|R
50|$|Founded at the {{beginnings}} of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> that formed part {{of one of the most}} known haciendas and of greater extension in the west zone of the Valley of Mexico, the Hacienda de la Condesa, were oriented South. It is known that the outline and the division of <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> were made by the Escandón Barrón brothers, whose family kept an intense activity in the creation of fraccionamientos and the real-state business in Mexico City from finals of the Porfiriato.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{gradually}} map the area the Allies {{were obliged to}} resort to mangrullos (improvised watch towers) or (a first in South American warfare) captive observation balloons, but the Paraguayans obscured <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> by lighting fires of damp grass.|$|E
40|$|A broad {{outline of}} the {{geologic}} history of Ganymede is presented, obtained from a first attempt to map the geology {{on a global scale}} and to interpret the characteristics of the observed geologic units. Features of <b>the</b> ancient cratered <b>terrain</b> such as craters and palimpsests, furrows and troughs, are discussed. <b>The</b> grooved <b>terrain</b> is described, including its sulci and cells, and the age relation of these units is considered along with the structure and origin of this <b>terrain.</b> <b>The</b> Gilgamesh Basin and Western Equatorial Basin in <b>the</b> post grooved <b>terrain</b> are treated, as are the bright and dark ray craters and the regolith. The development of all these regions and features is discussed in context. For the regolith, this includes the effect of water migration, sputtering, and thermal annealing. The histories of <b>the</b> ancient cratered <b>terrain,</b> <b>the</b> grooved <b>terrain,</b> and <b>the</b> post grooved <b>terrain</b> are presented...|$|R
