Since <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> |dv/dt| <b>observed</b> at B 34 (2295  kV/ms) is lower than the “High-setting” of R 34 (2650  kV/ms), the local measurement based ROCOV unit at R 34 did not detect this fault.

The angular deformation of N–H bond of amino groups occurs at 1600  cm− 1 (1500 – 1620  cm− 1), though it is weaker due to N-methylation in TMC (Mourya and Inamdar 2009). Intensity of the peak at 1030  cm− 1 increased in alginate–TMC–mPEG microcapsules due to grafting mPEG–SVA on alginate–TMC microcapsules. <b>The</b> <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> at 1600  cm− 1 {{is associated with the}} presence of amino I group (bending bond) (Sadeghi et al. 2004). The reduced peak intensity for alginate–TMC–mPEG microcapsules, in comparison with alginate–TMC, could be related to the bonding of NH 3 + groups of TMC to COO− groups of mPEG. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> at 3000 – 3500  cm− 1 is related to hydroxyl and stretching amino groups. Figure  1 shows that addition of a layer to the microcapsules would result in a wider peak in this range.
