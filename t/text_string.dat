5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode <b>text</b> <b>string.</b>|$|E

Design: Our program {{allows users to}} enter clinical findings using their own vernacular.

The interface program includes two components: a speechrecognition component that converts utterances into <b>text</b> <b>strings,</b> and a languageprocessing component that matches recognized <b>text</b> <b>strings</b> with controlledvocabulary terms. The speech-recognition component is composed of commercially available speech-recognition hardware and software, and developer-created grammars, which specify the language to be recognized. The language-processing component is composed of a translator, which extracts a canonical form from both recognized <b>text</b> <b>strings</b> and controlled-vocabulary terms, and a matcher, which measures [...] ...|$|R

Although this association might be very valuable for word disambiguation, it has not been exploited. In this paper, we present the problem of lack of context awareness for UI localization, providing real examples and identifying the main research challenges.
