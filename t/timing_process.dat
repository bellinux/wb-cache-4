50|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (typically {{abbreviated to}} DI) is a motion picture finishing process which classically involves digitizing a motion picture and manipulating {{the color and}} other image characteristics. It often replaces or augments the photochemical <b>timing</b> <b>process</b> and is usually the final creative adjustment to a movie before distribution in theaters. It is distinguished from the telecine process in which film is scanned and color is manipulated early in the process to facilitate editing. However the lines between telecine and DI are continually blurred and are often executed on the same hardware by colorists of the same background. These two steps are typically {{part of the overall}} color management process in a motion picture at different points in time. A digital intermediate is also customarily done at higher resolution and with greater color fidelity than telecine transfers.|$|E

40|$|At {{the heart}} of a new product sales-forecasting model for {{consumer}} packaged goods is a multiple-event <b>timing</b> <b>process.</b> Even after controlling for the effects of time-varying marketing mix covariates, this <b>timing</b> <b>process</b> is not a stationary one, which means the standard interpurchase time models developed within the marketing literature are not suitable for new products. In this paper, we develop a dynamic changepoint model that captures the underlying evolution of the buying behavior associated with the new product. This extends the basic changepoint framework, as used by a number of statisticians, by allowing the changepoint process itself to evolve over time. Additionally, this model nests a number of the standard multiple-event timing models considered in the marketing literature. In our empirical analysis, we show that the dynamic changepoint model accurately tracks (and forecasts) the total sales curve as well as its trial and repeat components and other managerial diagnostics (e. g., percent of triers repeating). sales forecasting, trial/repeat, new product research, duration models, nonstationarity, changepoint models...|$|E

40|$|Impulsive choice {{behavior}} {{incorporates the}} psychological mechanisms {{involved in the}} processing of the anticipated magnitude and delay until reward. The goal of the present experiment {{was to determine whether}} individual differences in such processes related to individual differences in impulsive choice behavior. Two groups of rats (Delay Group and Magnitude Group) were initially exposed to an impulsive choice task with choices between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) rewards. The Delay Group was subsequently exposed to a temporal discrimination task followed by a progressive interval task, whereas the Magnitude Group was exposed to a reward magnitude sensitivity task followed by a progressive ratio task. Inter-task correlations revealed that the rats in the Delay Group that made more self-controlled (LL) choices also displayed lower standard deviations in the temporal bisection task and greater delay tolerance in the progressive interval task. Impulsive choice behavior in the Magnitude Group did not display any substantial correlations with the reward magnitude sensitivity and progressive ratio tasks. The results indicate the importance of core <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> in impulsive choice behavior, and encourage further research examining the effects of changes in core <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> on impulsive choice...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that normal aging may produce declines in some motor tasks but not others. One {{account of the}} task-specific aging effects suggests that age-related differences will be evident in tasks that demand high-level processing but not in tasks that can be performed relatively automatically. To test this hypothesis we compared the performance of young and older adults on two bimanual circle drawing tasks that utilize either low-level emergent <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> (continuous circle drawing) or higher-level event-based timing mechanisms (intermittent circle drawing). The circle drawing tasks were performed with the hands coupled in either a symmetrical or asymmetrical coordination mode and at two individually-determined movement frequencies (comfortable and fast). Older participants were able to match the performance of young adults under both coordination modes and movement frequencies in the bimanual continuous circling task, but showed significantly greater temporal variability when performing the intermittent circling task. The {{results of the study}} are in accordance with the view that age-related effects will be observed in tasks in which movement timing is guided by high-level representations but not in tasks involving relatively automatic low-level <b>timing</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that {{climbing}} neural activity, as for example {{reflected by the}} contingent negative variation (CNV) in the electroencephalogram, is the signature of the subjective experience of time. According to this view, {{the resolution of the}} CNV coincides with termination of subjective <b>timing</b> <b>processes.</b> Paradoxically, behavioral data indicate that participants keep track of timing even after the standard interval (SI) has passed. This study addresses whether timing continues after CNV resolution. In Experiment 1, human participants were asked to discriminate time intervals while evoked potentials (EPs) elicited by the sound terminating a comparison interval (CI) were measured. As the amplitude of N 1 P 2 components increases {{as a function of the}} temporal distance from the SI, and the latency of the P 2 component followed the hazard rate of the CIs, <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> continue after CNV resolution. Based on a novel experimental paradigm, statistical model comparisons and trial-by-trial analyses, Experiment 2 supports this finding as subjective time is more accurately indexed by the amplitude of early EPs than by CNV amplitude. These results provide the first direct evidence that subjective timing of multisecond intervals does not depend on climbing neural activity as indexed by the CNV and that the subjective experience of time is better reflected by distinct features of post-CI evoked potentials...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{we showed that}} community children with hyperactive behavior were more inconsistent than controls in the temporal organization of their motor output. In this study we investigated: (1) various aspects of motor <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> in 13 clinically diagnosed boys with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) who were compared to 11 community boys with hyperactive behavior and to a control group and (2) the effect of methylphenidate on the motor <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> in the clinical group with ADHD in a double blind, cross-over, medication-placebo design, including 4 weeks of medication. The clinical group with ADHD, like the community group with hyperactivity, showed greater variability in sensorimotor synchronization and in sensorimotor anticipation relative to controls. The clinical group was also impaired in time perception, which was spared in the community group with hyperactivity. The persistent, but not the acute dose, of methylphenidate reduced the variability of sensorimotor synchronization and anticipation, but had no effect on time perception. This study shows that motor timing functions are impaired in both clinical and community children with hyperactivity. It is the first study to show the effectiveness of persistent administration of methylphenidate on deficits in motor timing in ADHD children and extends the use of methylphenidate from the domain of attentional and inhibitory functions to the domain of executive motor timing...|$|R
30|$|The {{discussed}} studies {{provide evidence}} that the determinants of planned retirement and retirement expectations are manifold and interrelated. Generally speaking, planning for retirement is a complex and long-lasting process and is often subject to adjustments over time, be it due to changes in national pension regulations, changes in health or altered financial conditions (Montalto et al. 2000). Despite the complexity of this particular topic, however, retirement expectations of individuals are solid and comply with actual retirement outcomes. Accordingly, several empirical studies (e.g., Bernheim 1987; Benitez-Silva and Dwyer 2005; Disney and Tanner 1999) have shown that expected dates of retirement are relatively accurate. Thus, analyzing planned retirement rather than actual retirement can provide important insights into the retirement <b>timing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|Though pulsars spin regularly, the {{differences}} between the observed and predicted ToA (time of arrival), known as "timing noise", can still reach a few milliseconds or more. We try to understand the noise in this paper. As proposed by Xu & Qiao in 2001, both dipole radiation and particle emission would result in pulsar braking. Accordingly, possible fluctuation of particle current flow is suggested here to contribute significant ToA variation of pulsars. We find that the particle emission fluctuation could lead to timing noise which can't be eliminated in <b>timing</b> <b>process,</b> and that a longer period fluctuation would arouse a stronger noise. The simulated timing noise profile and amplitude are in accord with the observed timing behaviors on the timescale of years. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures. (Accepted by Chin. Phys. Lett. ...|$|E

A strictly serial model, such as the behavioral theory of timing (Killeen & Fetterman, 1988), does not fit the dynamic correlation pattern in the location and duration of the middle high-rate responding portion of peak trials. In contrast, the parallel scalar expectancy theory model, with a sample for memory and threshold, does fit this pattern. A modification of the serial model is presented that also accommodates the within-trial covariance pattern. The modification, which is formally equivalent to a model for human tapping (Wing & Kristofferson, 1973), entails the addition of concurrent processes operating in parallel with serial timing...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria are the {{simplest}} known cellular systems that regulate their biological activities in daily cycles. For the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, {{it has been}} shown by in vitro and in vivo experiments that the basic circadian <b>timing</b> <b>process</b> is based on rhythmic phosphorylation of KaiC hexamers. Despite the excellent experimental work, a full systems level understanding of the in vitro clock is still lacking. In this work, we provide a mathematical approach to scan different hypothetical mechanisms for the primary circadian oscillator, starting from experimentally established molecular properties of the clock proteins. Although optimised for highest performance, only one of the in silico-generated reaction networks was able to reproduce the experimentally found high amplitude and robustness against perturbations. In this reaction network, a negative feedback synchronises the phosphorylation level of the individual hexamers and has indeed been realised in S. elongatus by KaiA sequestration as confirmed by experiments...|$|E

This article, a preprint, has recently received an attention, raising errors related to the <b>timing</b> <b>process</b> within the OPERA Collaboration results in [1], {{that turns out to}} be a wrong route by which serious science should not be accomplished. A peer-reviewed status should be previously considered to assert that [2] claims a solution for the superluminal results in [1]. Within [2], it seems there is an intrinsical misconception within its claimed solution, since an intrinsical proper time reasoning leads to the assumption the OPERA collaboration interprets a time variation as a proper time when correcting time intervals between a GPS frame and the grounded baseline frame. Furthermore, the author of [2] seems to double radio signals, doubling the alleged half of the truly observed time of flight, since the Lorentz transformations do consider radio signals intrinsically by construction...|$|E
30|$|Consequently, from a {{systematic}} perspective, the energy efficiency of USCS is much superior to both BPSK and UWB-IR even in continuous carrier-synchronized mode, which essentially provides one competitive approach to green communications. If reconfigurable emission in transceiver is considered, furthermore, the USCS energy efficiency may {{become much more}} conspicuous with the significantly reduced energy consumption in transmitter. Assuming an operational time ratio between the two hybrid modes (i.e., continuous emission and intermittent emission) is 10 %, then a schematic ultra-low-power communication architecture with energy consumption far less than 400 μW, i.e., 1 mW × [10 %/ 2 + (1 - 30 %)/ 2], can be basically promised without taking the potential advantages of WF waveform design and low-complexity detection. Notice that, in our above rough evaluation, the first term (i.e., 10 %) accounts for the combined benefits from both the precise synchronization and reconfigurable emission, while the second (i.e., 30 %) represents the energy saving introduced by the simplified <b>timing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|An autoregulatory transcription-translation {{feedback}} loop {{is thought to}} be essential in generating circadian rhythms in any model organism. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the essential clock protein KaiC is proposed to form this type of transcriptional negative feedback. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here temperature-compensated, robust circadian cycling of KaiC phosphorylation even without kaiBC messenger RNA accumulation under continuous dark conditions. This rhythm persisted {{in the presence of a}} transcription or translation inhibitor. Moreover, kinetic profiles in the ratio of KaiC autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation were also temperature compensated in vitro. Thus, the cyanobacterial clock can keep time independent of de novo transcription and translation processes.

40|$|Abstract: Some recent papers {{proposed}} {{to distinguish between}} event-based and emergent timing. Event-based timing is conceived as prescribed by events produced by a central clock, {{and seems to be}} used in discrete tasks (e. g., finger tapping). Emergent or dynamical timing refers to the exploitation of the dynamical properties of effectors, and is typically used in continuous tasks (e. g., circle drawing). The analysis of period series suggested that both <b>timing</b> control <b>processes</b> possess fractal properties, characterized by self-similarity and long-range dependence. The aim {{of this article is to}} present two models that produce period series presenting the statistical properties previously evidenced in discrete and continuous rhythmic tasks. The first one is an adaptation of the classical activation/threshold models, including a plateau-like evolution of the threshold over time. The second one is a hybrid limit cycle model, including a time-dependent linear stiffness parameter. Both models reproduced satisfactorily the spectral signatures of event-based and dynamical <b>timing</b> <b>processes,</b> respectively. The models also produced auto-correlation functions similar to those experimentally observed. Using ARFIMA modeling we show that these simulated series possess fractal properties. We suggest in conclusion some possible extensions of this modeling approach, to account for the effects of metronomic pacing, or to analyze bimanual coordination...|$|R

40|$|Musical rhythms {{are often}} {{perceived}} and interpreted within a metrical framework that integrates timing information hierarchically based on interval ratios. Endogenous <b>timing</b> <b>processes</b> facilitate this metrical integration and allow us using the sensory context for predicting when an expected sensory event will happen (‘predictive timing’). Previously, {{we showed that}} listening to metronomes and subjectively imagining the two different meters of march and waltz modulated the resulting auditory evoked responses in the temporal lobe and motor-related brain {{areas such as the}} motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Here we further explored the intentional transitions between the two metrical contexts, known as hemiola in the Western classical music dating back to the 16 th century. We examined MEG from 12 musicians while they repeatedly listened to a sequence of 12 unaccented clicks with an interval of 390 ms, and tapped to them with the right hand according to a 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 hemiola accent pattern. While participants listened to the same metronome sequence and imagined the accents, their pattern of brain responses significantly changed just before the pivot point of metric transition from ternary to binary meter. Until 100 ms before the pivot point, brain activities were more similar to those in the simple ternary meter than those in the simple binary meter, but the pattern was reversed afterwards. A similar transition was also observed at the downbeat after the pivot. Brain areas related to the metric transition were identified from source reconstruction of the MEG using a beamformer and included auditory cortices, sensorimotor and premotor cortices, cerebellum, inferior/middle frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, cingulate cortex, and precuneus.
