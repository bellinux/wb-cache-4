Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As soon as I saw Smith the hairs on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him." ...|$|E

60|$|I felt {{as though}} {{somebody}} was pouring funk out of a can down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> My legs became feeble.

60|$|He {{turned the}} handle as he spoke, {{but the door}} did not yield. We threw {{ourselves}} against it. With a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room.

60|$|One moment I had {{sat with}} my mind filled with sublime resolutions, the next I was {{flattened}} out upon {{the bottom of}} the boat, the breath dashed out of my body, and this monster pinning me down. I felt the fierce pants of his hot breath upon <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> In an instant he had torn away my sword, had slipped a sack over my head, and had tied a rope firmly round the outside of it.|$|E
6000|$|We {{believe that}} the Reverend George H. Nobbs is still alive. At all events he was so last year, (1879), having written a letter in June to the Secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in which, among other things, he speaks of the [...] "rapidly {{increasing}} community, now numbering 370 persons." [...] He adds--"I am becoming very feeble from age, and my memory fails me in consequence of an operation at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> for carbuncle two years since;" [...] {{and goes on to}} tell of the flourishing condition of his flock.|$|E
60|$|The street rang {{with the}} cheer that followed, and when Dixon seized his hat {{the action was}} infectious. The next minute we were moving forward amid {{the ranks of the}} {{enthusiastic}} crowd behind the vehicle, which jolted slowly towards the station; and I discovered later that the uncomfortable sensation at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> was caused by the hot oil from a torch, which dripped upon it. In the meantime I noticed nothing but the sea of faces, the tramp of feet, and the final burst of cheering at the station, in which Mackay, holding aloft his forage cap, joined vociferously.|$|E

And suddenly a kiss, there on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> And my hand shook all the afternoon so that I couldn't paint. I took out my watch and marked the hour when I would allow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes only--it was so precious--the kiss of an old grey-haired woman with a wart on her nose, the mother of all my kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come, Hubert." ...|$|E
60|$|Some irresistible {{force at}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> dragged me {{instantly}} into a sitting position, {{and so for}} the first time I was able to look round me in a dazed fashion, and to see these men into whose hands I had fallen. That they were murderers in the past and had murderous plans for the future I already gathered from what I had heard and seen. I understood also that in the heart of that lonely marsh I was absolutely in their power. None the less, I remembered the name that I bore, and I concealed as far as I could the sickening terror which lay at my heart.|$|E
60|$|Suffice it that I {{submitted}} {{and went}} through with the cruel infliction of a shave by a French barber; tears of exquisite agony coursed down my cheeks now and then, but I survived. Then the incipient assassin held a basin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face, and into my bosom, and down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> with a mean pretense of washing away the soap and blood. He dried my features with a towel {{and was going to}} comb my hair, but I asked to be excused. I said, with withering irony, that it was sufficient to be skinned--I declined to be scalped.|$|E
