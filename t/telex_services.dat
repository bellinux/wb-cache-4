50|$|In 1967 Morocco {{placed the}} first {{underwater}} cable between Tetouan, Morocco, and Perpignan, France, through the Mediterranean. A few years later, in 1970, a transmission via INTELSAT was introduced. The <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> was then automated in 1971 just before installing a digital center in Fes.|$|R
50|$|Short-wave {{telephone}} communications {{with other countries}} were opened in 1935. The submarine cable, Scotice, between Scotland and Iceland was opened in 1962. In connection with the cable, <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> were established in Iceland. A year later, the Icecan cable between Iceland and Canada was formally opened. In 1980, the Skyggnir Earth Station came online, and telephone calls to other countries then went via satellite. Direct dialling to other countries became possible for the first time. In 1994, a new submarine cable, CANTAT-3, was opened.|$|E
5000|$|The Telex {{input method}} {{is based on}} a set of rules for {{transmitting}} accented Vietnamese text over telex (máy điện tín) first used in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s. <b>Telex</b> <b>services</b> at the time ran over infrastructure that was designed overseas to handle only a basic Latin alphabet, so a message reading [...] "vỡ đê" [...] ("the dam broke") could easily be misinterpreted as [...] "vợ đẻ" [...] ("the wife is giving birth"). Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh, a prominent journalist and translator, is credited with devising the original set of rules for telex systems.|$|E

The Australian Telecommunications Employees' Assoiation,(ATEA) decides unanimously {{to accept a}} peace plan negotiated over the weekend {{with the assistance of}} ACTU President Bob Hawke to end month-old work bans that had severely disrupted overseas and local telephone calls, computer and <b>telex</b> <b>services.</b> [...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|E
50|$|High-speed newspaper-page-facsimile {{equipment}} and Chinese character - code translation equipment were {{used on a}} large scale. Sixty-four-channel program-controlled automatic message retransmission {{equipment and}} low- or medium-speed data transmission and exchange equipment also received extensive use. International <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> was available in coastal cities and special economic zones.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the charges}} {{inherent}} in use of the <b>Telex</b> <b>service,</b> messages sent via Prestel Telex Link were chargeable, in 1984 {{at the rate of}} 50p for destinations in the UK, £1.00 for Europe, £2.00 for North America, £3.00 for elsewhere and even £5.00 for sending to ships via INMARSAT. There was no charge to Prestel users for receiving Telex messages.|$|R
50|$|In 1945 as {{the traffic}} {{increased}} {{it was decided}} to have a separate network for Telex traffic and the first manual exchange opened in London. By 1954 the public inland <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> opened via manually switched exchanges. A number of subscribers were served via automatic sub-centres based on Post Office relays and Type 2 Uniselectors acting as concentrators for the manual exchange.|$|R
50|$|Teletex was {{designed}} as an upgrade to the conventional <b>telex</b> <b>service.</b> The terminal-to-terminal communication <b>service</b> of <b>telex</b> would be turned into an office-to-office document transmission system by teletex. Teletex envisaged direct communication between electronic typewriters, word processors and personal computers. These units had storage for transmitting and receiving messages. The use of such equipment considerably enhanced the character set available for document preparation.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq {{responded by}} {{launching}} another [...] "war of the cities". In one attack, Tehran's main oil refinery was hit, {{and in another}} instance, Iraq damaged Iran's Assadabad satellite dish, disrupting Iranian overseas telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> for almost two weeks. Civilian areas were also hit, resulting in many casualties. Iraq continued to attack oil tankers via air. Iran responded by launching Scud missiles and air attacks at Iraqi targets.|$|R
5000|$|KPH is {{a public}} coast radio station on the West Coast of the United States. For most of the 20th century, it {{provided}} ship to shore communications including telegrams (using Morse code) and marine <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> (using radioteletype). The station discontinued commercial operation in 1998, but is operated occasionally as a historic service - its signal can be tuned in throughout {{a large portion of}} the western hemisphere.|$|R

50|$|The first {{telephone}} service in Norway was offered in 1878 between Arendal and Tvedestrand, {{while the first}} international {{telephone service}} between Christiania and Stockholm was offered in 1893. Automation of the telephone system was started in 1920 and completed in 1985. In 1946 the first <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> was offered, and in 1976 satellite telephone connections to oil platforms in the North Sea were installed. In 1980 the first steps to digitalise the telephone network were taken.|$|R
5000|$|Western Union {{purchased}} the TWX system from AT&T in January 1969. The TWX {{system and the}} special US area codes (510, 710, 810 and 910) continued right up to 1981 when Western Union completed the conversion to the Western Union Telex II system. Any remaining [...] "3-row" [...] Baudot customers were converted to Western Union <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> during the period 1979 to 1981. Bell Canada retained area code 610 until 1992; its remaining numbers were moved to non-geographic area code 600.|$|R
50|$|Canada-wide {{automatic}} teleprinter exchange {{service was}} introduced by the CPR Telegraph Company and CN Telegraph in July 1957 (the two companies, operated by rivals Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, would join to form CNCP Telecommunications in 1967). This service supplemented the existing international <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> that {{was put in place}} in November 1956. Canadian telex customers could connect with nineteen European countries in addition to eighteen Latin American, African, and trans-Pacific countries. The major exchanges were located in Montreal (01), Toronto (02), and Winnipeg (03).|$|R
50|$|<b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> spread within Europe and (particularly after 1945) {{around the}} world.By 1978, West Germany, {{including}} West Berlin, had 123,298 telex connections. Long before automatic telephony became available, most countries, even in central Africa and Asia, {{had at least}} a few high-frequency (shortwave) telex links. Often, government postal and telegraph services (PTTs) initiated these radio links. The most common radio standard, CCITT R.44 had error-corrected retransmitting time-division multiplexing of radio channels. Most impoverished PTTs operated their telex-on-radio (TOR) channels non-stop, to get the maximum value from them.|$|R

Singing telegrams followed in 1933, intercity fax in 1935, and commercial intercity microwave communications in 1943. In 1958, it began offering <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> to customers in New York City. [...] In honor of Valentine's Day 1959, Western Union introduced the 'Candygram, {{a box of}} chocolates accompanying a telegram featured in a commercial with the rotund Don Wilson. On the 1970s version of Let's Make a Deal, hosted by Monty Hall, Western Union Candygrams (with a cash message inside) were offered to contestants as a prize during a deal. In 1964, Western Union initiated a transcontinental microwave system to replace land lines.|$|R
