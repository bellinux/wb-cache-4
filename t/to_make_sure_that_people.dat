50|$|Brown is {{the only}} child of Nellie Lewis, a nuclear scientist, and Julius Myers, a chef and restaurateur. Native to both Philadelphia and North Carolina she grew up mainly on 47th Street and Paschall Avenue of Southwest Philadelphia. Brown's first dance {{instructors}} and role models were Essie Marie Dorsey, Sydney Gibson King, and Marion Durham Cuyjet. As a child she wished to shatter the social barriers prohibiting African Americans from becoming famous in the world of dance. During a time where famous dance personalities were predominantly light skinned, Brown worked hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> of color acquired equal status in mainstream dance. She dreamed of a school where African Americans could learn and develop through methods tailored specifically to their individual needs - a program that was specially created for ethnic bodies.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with changes}} in food, {{starting}} early in the 20th century, governments have issued nutrition guidelines, leading to the food pyramid (introduced in Sweden in 1974). The 1916 [...] "Food For Young Children" [...] became the first USDA guide to give specific dietary guidelines. Updated in the 1920s, these guides gave shopping suggestions for different-sized families along with a Depression Era revision which included four cost levels. In 1943, the USDA created the [...] "Basic Seven" [...] chart <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> got the recommended nutrients. It included the first-ever Recommended Daily Allowances from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, the [...] "Essentials of an Adequate Diet" [...] brought recommendations which {{cut the number of}} groups that American school children would learn about down to four. In 1979, a guide called [...] "Food" [...] addressed the link between too much of certain foods and chronic diseases, but added [...] "fats, oils, and sweets" [...] to the four basic food groups.|$|E

He reorganised National Intelligence {{after the}} Information Scandal and {{adjusted}} the national service <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would not suffer financial loss or travel unnecessarily while doing their military service. Coetsee was appointed as Minister of Justice on 7 October 1980. He changed {{the legal system}} by introducing the small claims court and pioneering the Matrimonial Property Act in 1984. This act had an important effect {{on the status of}} married women and introduced the accrual system of sharing property between spouses. Coetsee also contributed to the process that made community service an alternative option to being jailed and did away with racially specific commissioners’ courts. He was serious about legal reform and in April 1986, he asked for a legal commission to look into the role of the courts in protecting group and individual rights, after which a report on human and group rights had to be drawn up. He also walked the Indemnity Act through parliament, ensuring that those who took part in political negotiations after the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) would receive temporary immunity.|$|E

5000|$|Gerard Mora gave an {{interview}} in Outburn, where he was asked [...] "What lyrical themes do you explore?", while his response was the following: [...] We're a Christian band and that's apparent in everything we do, so our lyrics are very Christian based, but they're not meant to come off as judgey or condemny. We view our band as a ministry, but we do it as an open invitation to talk. We don't go and sit in our van while the other bands are playing. We go out to meet people and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> feel the love that we feel through Christ. So, {{a lot of that}} comes across in our lyrics. For Written in Blood, the lyrics all deal with the theme that in life there's struggle, and as people we all go through our trials, but the idea is that we're all suffering together. It's reassuring to know that other people are going through the same problems, whether it's people across the world or our neighbors.

50|$|Many years ago, {{an unknown}} {{man who knew}} the devil and named {{blacksmith}} settled {{on the top of}} the mountain Demerdzhi. Once, the mountain shook and houses within the villages were then destroyed. Villagers gathered together to discuss because the mountain was at peace before the strange man came. They decided to send the most courageous and intelligent ones up the mountain, requesting the stranger to leave, but he refused.After a while, a beautiful Greek woman came to the mountain and sat down to rest near a spring. In the village, where she was from, the fountains stopped murmuring, and people lost their water. People then realized who was the cult of the disaster and went to demand the return of beauty.The news was spread that the stranger was the great sinner. People believed that the mountain trembled because it does not want to carry him anymore. Terrified inhabitants of the valley gathered in the ancient temple and begged God to save them from the evil alien but nothings happened for long days. When the holidays horban-Adha come, believers prayed for three days and nights. The flame was raised on Demerdzhi, buzzes and groanings were all around, great stones fell down from the mountain. As everything came to peace, people did not see the terrible alien anymore. But strangely, they found stone figures of animals, form of people and unseen monsters on the mountainside facing the Babuganu (a part Gurzufskaya plateau). Later, people learned that this was done <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should never forget the terrible sinner who was responsible of that tragedy.|$|E
50|$|In some {{marketing}} schemes, marketers {{create a}} need {{that was not}} present and then offer to fulfill that need. A {{good example of this}} is credit card companies. Credit card companies are companies that, like most other companies, started off by providing a convenience to the population. Credit cards offer an alternative method of payment to cash or check and make life simpler for many people; however, today there are over 600 million credit cards issued in the United States alone and four major credit card companies. It is no longer even possible to buy a car, get a home loan, or rent an apartment from many companies without a positive credit score. This fact has necessitated the need for almost every citizen to have a credit card. However, many credit cards companies manage their perception <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> continue to need credit cards, and control their perception so that many people do not fully understand what they are getting into. However, the fact that the average household in the United States is in over fifteen thousand dollars worth of debt never reaches the widespread public. Instead, they publicize how they will help if a card gets stolen, or that they have the lowest interest percentage compared to the other major competitors. But no company tells their customers that the promoted interest rate more than doubles if they do not pay the minimum balance on time. For instance, Discover's interest rate increases to 18.99% after the first minimum balance is not paid on time. In short, though credit cards are convenient and do fulfill a need, the companies often make no mention of the negative effects that they have on many people.|$|E
