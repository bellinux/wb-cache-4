Their intriguing story has continued to be the subject of some romanticizing, as in the film The Mission (1986) whose story relates to the events of the 1750s shown on a miniature scale.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Jesuit <b>Reductions</b> were a {{particular}} {{version of the}} general Catholic strategy used in the 17th and 18th centuries of building reductions (reducciones de indios), in order to Christianize the indigenous populations of the Americas more efficiently. <b>The</b> <b>reductions</b> were created by the Catholic order of the Jesuits in South America, in areas inhabited by the Tupi-Guarani peoples, which generally corresponds to modern day Paraguay. Later reductions were extended into the areas that correspond to Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Uruguay. In these regions <b>the</b> Jesuit <b>reductions</b> were different from <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> in other regions, because the Indians were expected to adopt Christianity but not European culture. [...] Under the Jesuit leadership of the Indians through native [...] "puppet" [...] caciques, <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> achieved {{a high degree of}} autonomy within the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires. With the use of Indian labour, <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> became economically successful. When their existence was threatened by the incursions of Bandeirante slave traders, Indian militia were created that fought effectively against the colonists.
