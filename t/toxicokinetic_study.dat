50|$|A well {{designed}} <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>study</b> may involve several different strategies and {{depends on the}} scientific question to be answered. Controlled acute and repeated toxicokinetic animal studies are useful to identify a chemical's biological persistence, tissue and whole body half-life, and its potential to bioaccumulate. Toxicokinetic profiles can change with increasing exposure duration or dose. Real world environmental exposures generally occur as low level mixtures, such as from air, water, food, or tobacco products. Mixture effects may differ from individual chemical toxicokinetic profiles because of chemical interactions, synergistic, or competitive processes. For other reasons, it is equally important to characterize the toxicokinetics of individual chemicals constituents found in mixtures as information on behavior or fate of the individual chemical can help explain environmental, human, and wildlife biomonitoring studies.|$|E

Descriptions of two study designs presented here represent the possible extremes in approaches to <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>studies.</b> The comprehensive approach is geared toward the development of physiology based pharmacokinetic models that relate external exposure to target organ dosimetry and addresses the questions: Is the chemical absorbed? How is the chemical metabolized? Where are the chemical and/or metabolites distributed in the body? What are the elimination rate and route of the chemical? What is the effect of dose on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination? The minimal study design is more limited in scope than the comprehensive design and addresses primarily the issues of absorption, distribution, and elimination of the parent chemical. Study protocols for most chemicals lie somewhere between these two extreme approaches. An increased understanding of the relationships between external exposure, target organ dosimetry, and adverse effects should provide greater confidence in making low-dose extrapolations of human risk.

Systemically absorbed doses of glyphosate estimated from the MAA urine biomonitoring data and from other published biomonitoring studies indicate that daily glyphosate doses are substantially below health protective reference standards (ADIs; RfDs) established by regulatory agencies. The MAA report also suggested that detection of relatively high glyphosate concentrations in breast milk in 3 of 10 sampled women raised a concern for bioaccumulation in breast milk. However, the breast milk concentrations reported by MAA are highly implausible when considered in context to low daily systemic doses of glyphosate estimated from human urine biomonitoring data, and also are inconsistent with animal toxicokinetic data demonstrating no evidence of retention in tissues or milk after single- or multiple-dose glyphosate treatment. In addition, <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> in lactating goats have shown that glyphosate does not partition into milk at concentrations greater than blood, and that only {{a very small percentage of}} the total administered dose (< 0. 03 %) is ultimately excreted into milk.

Therefore, the properties associated with this material are described in detail. Despite its widespread use, the analytical determination and characterization of nanosized metal oxides is not as straightforward as the comparatively easy-to-detect metallic nanoparticles (e. g., silver or gold). This study presents the method development and the results of the determination of tissue titanium (Ti) levels after treatment of rats with the nanosized TiO 2. Total Ti levels were chosen to evaluate the presence and distribution of TiO 2 nanoparticles. A procedure consisting of incubation with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO 3) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), and heating was developed to digest tissues and TiO 2 nanomaterials in order to determine the total Ti content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). For the inter-laboratory comparison, altogether four laboratories analyzed the same samples upon digestion using the available ICPMS equipment. A major premise for any <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>study</b> is the possibility to detect the chemical under investigation in biological samples (tissues). So, the study has to be performed with a dose high enough to allow for subsequent tissue level measurement of the chemical under investigation. On the other hand, dose of the chemical applied should not induce over toxicity in the animal as this may affect its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. To determine a non-toxic TiO 2 dosage, an acute toxicity study in rats was performed, and the organs obtained were evaluated for the presence of Ti by ICPMS. Despite the differences in methodology and independent of the sample preparation and the ICPMS equipment used, the results obtained for samples with Ti concentrations > 4 μg Ti/g tissue agreed well.

Notwithstanding its high prevalence, {{little is known}} about the possible effects of TeA on animal or human health. For a better understanding of these effects and thus for a better risk assessment, elucidating the toxicokinetic characteristics of TeA is crucial. Therefore, the aim was to develop a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative determination of TeA in broiler chicken plasma. Plasma sample preparation consisted of a protein precipitation method using acetonitrile, followed by evaporation of the supernatant. The dry residue was dissolved in 5 mM ammonium formate in water (pH 9) /methanol (95 / 5, v/v). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a double end-capped Zorbax® Eclipse Plus column. Mobile phases A and B were run in a gradient elution program and consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in water (pH 9) (A) and methanol (B). The LC effluent was interfaced to a TSQ® Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the negative h-ESI mode. Acquisition was performed in the selected reaction monitoring mode. The LC-MS/MS method was successfully in-house validated according to the protocol described by De Baere et al. (1). Linearity (correlation coefficient (r) and goodness-of-fit (g)), within- and between run accuracy and precision, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), specificity, carry over, extraction recovery (RE) and signal suppression or enhancement (SSE) were evaluated. The results for r, g, within- and between-run accuracy and precision fell within the acceptance ranges. The LOQ and LOD were 5. 0 ng/mL and 0. 22 ng/mL, respectively. Finally, the LC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to a <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>study</b> of TeA in broiler chickens, therefore demonstrating the suitability for this application. 1.

40|$|Rationale: Aging adults {{represent}} {{the fastest growing}} population segment in many countries. Physiological and metabolic changes in the aging process may alter how aging adults respond to exposures compared to younger workers. Current preventive workplace exposure measures may therefore not be sufficiently protective for the aging workforce. In a controlled human <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>study</b> (exposure chamber; 12 m 3), the volunteers (n= 11) were men and women {{over the age of}} 58 years and exposed to a commonly used, low neurotoxic glycol ether; PGME (CAS no. 107 - 98 - 2) (50 ppm, 6 hours). Oxidative metabolism (Michaelis-Menten) is the major pathway and conjugation the minor in humans. Metabolites, conjugated and free PGME are eliminated through the kidneys, and the elimination kinetics is dose-dependent (0 order). Scope: (1) compare the toxicokinetic profile of PGME obtained in the aging volunteers (58 - 62 years) to young volunteers (20 - 25 years) from a previous study; (2) Test the predictive power of an existing PGME toxicokinetic compartment model for aging persons against urinary PGME concentrations found in volunteers from our experimental study. Experimental procedure: Urine samples were collected before, every 2 -hour during exposures for six hours, and ad-lib for additional 20 hours. Urinary analysis of free and total PGME was performed using capillary GC/FID. The toxicokinetic model (Berkley Madonna software) was ageadjusted. Results. Urinary free and total PGME concentration rose rapidly, and did not reach an apparent plateau level during exposure. Less conjugation was observed in the older group. The predictive model developed for the young group predicted well total PGME in the aging group but not free PGME. The age adjusted toxicokinetic model's Vmax 1 had to be changed for the aging group, implying slower enzymatic pathway. Conclusion: The toxicokinetic model did not predict well if only the physiological parameters were adjusted for aging adults (existing model); a substance specific metabolic rate parameter was also needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} whether a metal mix-ture added to diet influences the toxicokinetics and toxicity of some elements. The metal mixture (MM) used in these experiments was ash (slag) from a coal gasification plant. The effect of this mixture (5 percent in diet) on the toxicokinetic and on the acute or subchronic toxicity of Cd, Hg, Mn was determined in rats of different ages. Rats were exposed for five weeks in toxicokinetic and six weeks in acute tox-icity experiments. Sucklings were exposed through their mothers, which received the MM in diet over the pregnancy and lactation period. In <b>toxicokinetic</b> <b>studies,</b> half of the animals additionally received Cd, Hg or Mn (100, 50 or 2000 ppm, respectively) in drinking water. In subchronic experiments, six-week-old albino rats of both sexes were given MM in the diet and Cd, Hg or Mn in drinking water for 16 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Thimerosal is an ethylmercury (49. 55 % mercury by weight) {{preservative}} historically {{added to}} some vaccines. <b>Toxicokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> showed {{children in the}} United States received doses of mercury from Thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) in excess of safety guidelines. In the United States during the 1990 s, diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines (maximally, 50 mg mercury per joint administration) and diphtheria– tetanus–pertussis–Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTPH) vaccines (25 mg mercury per admin-istration) were given to children in the same childhood vaccination schedule at 2, 4, 6, and 15 – 18 mo, so that children receiving DTP and Hib vaccines may have maximally received an additional 100 mg more mercury exposure from TCVs than children administered DTPH vaccines.

40|$|AbstractOver 40 {{years of}} {{scientific}} {{evidence indicates that}} methyl methacrylate (MMA) causes olfactory effects in rodents {{that are relevant to}} humans. More recent scientific studies have focused on understanding the apparent lack of species concordance between the rodent and human <b>studies.</b> <b>Toxicokinetic</b> <b>studies</b> and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model describing inhalation dosimetry of MMA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of rats and humans point to differences in nasal morphology and biochemistry that could explain and reconcile these differences as species-specific manifestations of a common toxicological process. We have applied the hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence (HBWoE) approach to evaluate the concordance of the available data and the hypothesis that the observed difference in sensitivity between rats and humans may be the expected result of physiological and biochemical differences. Our WoE analysis indicates that when the several lines of evidence (i. e., animal, human, mode-of-action, and toxicokinetics data) are integrated, they inform interpretation of one another and, overall, support use of the human data for derivation of an MMA occupational exposure level (OEL) of 50 ppm...|$|R
