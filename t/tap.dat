In a further control condition (Experiment 4), <b>tapping</b> was omitted altogether. The results revealed a prominent entrainment of spontaneous blink behavior by the manual <b>tapping,</b> with bimanual <b>tapping</b> being more effective than unimanual <b>tapping,</b> and with the "strong" and "impulse-like" <b>tapping</b> showing the largest effects on blink timing. Conversely, we found no significant effects of the <b>tapping</b> on the timing of the eye blinks across all experiments. The findings suggest a functional overlap of the motor control structures responsible for voluntary, rhythmic finger movements and eye blinking behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is <b>tapping</b> with less longer <b>tapping</b> cuts. The reduction of the <b>tapping</b> cut length in reverse <b>tapping</b> permits to manage better the <b>tapping</b> panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} length(s) of <b>tapping</b> cut, in downward <b>tapping,</b> which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the <b>tapping</b> cut length on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral <b>tapping</b> cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the <b>tapping</b> cuts length induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the <b>tapping</b> cuts length. The yield per centimetre of <b>tapping</b> cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between <b>tapping</b> intensity and rubber yield, <b>tapping</b> intensity and annual mean girth increment and between <b>tapping</b> intensity and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve tendency equations were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the <b>tapping</b> cut length better than the GT 1. The reduction of <b>tapping</b> cuts length favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

40|$|Evaluating hand <b>tapping</b> as a {{clinical}} biomarker in Parkinson and Huntington’s diseases, using an Android device was {{the objective of}} the study. A novel hand -tapping tool using an Android OS was developed over a year, which included 5 <b>tapping</b> tasks. The application was meant for installation on Samsung Galaxy 7 ” tablet devices. The tasks included finger tapping; metronome based <b>tapping,</b> simple and choice reaction time and was used to study a cross section of 45 controls of three different age groups, from 20 - 30 years, 35 - 45 years and 65 - 80 years. Age and gender matched controls to Parkinson’s subjects (n= 21) and Huntington’s disease patients (n= 17) were assessed using the same <b>tapping</b> tasks. Baseline values for various <b>tapping</b> measures such as <b>tapping</b> rate, inter-tap interval, force, pro-tap (simple) reaction time, anti-tap(choice) reaction time were obtained. The study reported a significant difference between 20 - 30 year olds and 65 - 80 year olds in <b>tapping</b> rates and inter-tap-interval of the double target <b>tapping</b> task. Displacement, pro-tap time and anti-tap times were lower in 20 - 30 s and 35 - 45 year olds compared to the 65 - 80 s group. PD patients showed markedly lower values and were significantly different from controls in <b>tapping</b> rates, displacement of single target <b>tapping,</b> <b>tapping</b> rates and inter-tap-interval of double target <b>tapping,</b> pro-tap and anti-tap times and their standard deviation. HD patients had significantly lower values in inter-tap-intervals, displacement of single finger <b>tapping,</b> <b>tapping</b> rates, inter-tap interval and displacement of double target <b>tapping,</b> pro-tap and anti-tap reaction times. In conclusion, the study enabled us to identify <b>tapping</b> parameters and reaction time tests which have the potential to differentiate between Parkinson’s and Huntington’s patients with controls, therefore making motoric task performance a potentially viable clinical biomarker in HD and PD.

This study investigated the methods of <b>tapping</b> wine from palm trees (Elaesis guineensis) among the Idoma and Tiv ethnic groups of Benue State. The aim was to examine the implication of the palm wine <b>tapping</b> methods on the conservation of the palm trees in the study area. Applying a multi-stage sampling technique, 150 respondents were sampled and interviewed using semi- structured questionnaire to generate data. This was backed up with field observations of various palm wine <b>tapping</b> methods to gather the required information. The result identified three palm wine <b>tapping</b> methods namely inflorescent flower, terminal budding and felling of palm trees. The inflorescent flower method practiced in Idoma areas had all the trees <b>tapped</b> surviving while none of the trees <b>tapped</b> using felling the tree method in both communities survived. The inflorescent flower <b>tapping</b> method adopted by majority of tappers in the Idoma ethnic group was found to be more sustainable for palm wine <b>tapping</b> as it ensures survival of trees <b>tapped,</b> providing for the palm wine needs of today and future generations. However, terminal budding method of palm wine <b>tapping</b> associated with Tiv ethnic group is destructive because only a fraction of one quarter palm trees survived after <b>tapping.</b> Creating awareness on palm tree-friendly <b>tapping</b> methods and conservation strategies among the <b>tapping</b> community in these ethnic groups will improve the availability of living palm trees for continuity of use...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{productivity}} and the susceptibility to the <b>tapping</b> panel dryness (TPD) of Hevea brasiliensis are determined by the intrinsic feature of each clone but also by the <b>tapping</b> system. Thus, in order to establish the <b>tapping</b> system that minimizes the TDP occurrence an experiment was carried out in Côte d'Ivoire with four high yielding clones including, PB 235, PB 255, IRCA 18 and IRCA 111. Five <b>tapping</b> systems (d 2 6 d/ 7 0 /y, d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y, d 4 6 d/ 7 6 /y, d 5 6 d/ 7 8 /y, d 6 6 d/ 7 10 /y) were applied to these clones, corresponding to a range of 100 % to 30 % of <b>tapping</b> intensities. The results show that the occurrence of TPD is closely related to the <b>tapping</b> intensity and the <b>tapping</b> system which consists in <b>tapping</b> twice per week with one day rest (S/ 2 d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y), was found to be the best <b>tapping</b> system. A quadratic relation was found between the rate of the TPD and the <b>tapping</b> intensity. Thus the clones IRCA 18 and IRCA 111, like PB 235 and PB 255, belong to the active metabolism clones. These clones also showed their adherence to the group of high rubber producer clones. This experiment also gave further evidence that the production of a tree for the <b>tapping</b> strongly depends on the intensity of <b>tapping.</b> It has also indicated that the intensity of <b>tapping</b> governed the <b>tapping</b> panel dryness rate among the clones having active metabolism, such as IRCA 18, IRCA 111, PB 235 and PB 255.
