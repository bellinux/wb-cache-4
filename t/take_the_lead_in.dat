5|$|The {{introduction}} of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France {{over a period of}} ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as}} a general haven of reform movements.|$|E

5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to preserve their lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in an effort to find the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, where they were drawn against Championship team Norwich City.

Although the sale was denied by manager Nigel Worthington, Ashton joined West Ham soon after for £7.2million. The match played at Norwich's home ground, Carrow Road, saw West Ham <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> the sixth minute through midfielder Hayden Mullins, and double it in the second half from striker Bobby Zamora.

5|$|David {{decides to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{opposing}} the Conqueror {{in hopes of}} earning independence for Athlum, which is currently a vassal state {{to the city of}} Celapaleis. The party succeeds in stopping the Conqueror's army from attacking Celapaleis, but the Conqueror himself attacks Athlum in their absence. He kills Emma, who had remained behind to defend the city and takes the massive Remnant of Athlum, shrinking it to a normal-sized sword. The party then returns to Elysion to rescue Irina from Wagram. Irina is revealed to have a special power, that of unbinding bound Remnants, and it was for this reason that she was kidnapped. They discover that Hermeien is trying to use the Conqueror and Wagram to spark distrust in the people for Remnants and the city-states' ability to control them, so that he can then use Irina and her power to prop himself up as supreme ruler. While the party are successful in retaking Irina and killing Hermeien, Wagram escapes while revealing that he and the Conqueror never planned to support Hermeien. Confronted by the Conqueror, Irina uses Nagapur's Remnant to protect her brother, destroying half of the city in the process.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of the}} seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} and most {{important}} naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>in</b> launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Conference Final began {{between the}} Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers on May 9.
