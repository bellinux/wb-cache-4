5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} the wine varies with the terroir. In the west, where the soil is more sandy, the wines are lighter; in the south, where the soil is more gravelly, the {{proportion}} of Merlot is lower, and the wines tend more towards <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> the Médoc.|$|E

25|$|The average pH {{of honey}} is 3.9, but {{can range from}} 3.4 to 6.1. Honey {{contains}} many kinds of acids, both organic and amino. However, the different types and their amounts vary considerably, {{depending on the type}} of honey. These acids may be aromatic or aliphatic (nonaromatic). The aliphatic acids contribute greatly to the flavor of honey by interacting with <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> other ingredients.|$|E
25|$|Within Pakistan, cuisine varies {{greatly from}} region to region, {{reflecting}} the country's {{ethnic and cultural}} diversity. Food from the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sindh can be highly seasoned and spicy, which is characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> the South Asian region. Food {{in other parts of}} Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas also hold distinct tastes based on various regional influences.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{fermentation}} process is halted rather quickly, <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> Maury do retain {{some of the}} natural primary grape aromas of Grenache {{along with some of}} the early fermentation esters that develop. But most of the distinctive character of Maury come from the aging process that can take place {{in a wide range of}} containers (from concrete and oak barrels to glass bonbonnes) kept in a variety of conditions (including out in the sun for deliberate oxidation) for a number of years depending the particular house style of the winemaker.|$|E
25|$|Amarones are rich, {{full-bodied}} wines with {{flavor and}} aroma notes {{that are often}} compared to <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> Port wine. The wines often have notes of mocha, bitter-sweet dark chocolate, raisin, dried fig and earthy flavors. At restaurants sommeliers will often recommend food and wine pairings for Amarone with hearty, heavy dishes such as meat roasts. A classic after-dinner assortment is Amarone paired with walnuts and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Master of wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that well-made examples of Amarone from favorable vintages usually need about ten years of bottle aging for the flavors to mature, and {{have the potential to}} continue developing for twenty years or more.|$|E
25|$|Mezcal {{is highly}} varied, {{depending}} on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the distillation process employed, creating subtypes with names such as de gusano, tobalá, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrón, de alacran, creme de café and more. A special recipe for a specific mezcal type known as pechuga uses cinnamon, apple, plums, cloves, and other spices that is then distilled through chicken, duck, or turkey breast. It is made when the specific fruits used in the recipe are available, usually during November or December. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, red bananas, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> the agave used to come forward.|$|E

500|$|A {{common factor}} {{affecting}} <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> Bordeaux wines is the harvest yields of Cabernet Sauvignon. Throughout Bordeaux {{there is a}} legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates {{taking advantage of the}} legal loophole of plafond limite de classement ("ceiling limit classification") that permits higher yields during [...] "exceptional" [...] years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's Grand vin.|$|E

500|$|The {{hedgehog}} mushroom {{is considered}} to be a good edible, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it the culinary equivalent of the chanterelle. Author Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of [...] "great" [...] and notes that there are no poisonous lookalikes, and that they are unlikely to be infested with maggots. Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. Hydnum repandum mushrooms can be cooked by pickling, simmering in milk or stock, and sautéeing, which creates a [...] "tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor." [...] The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes <b>the</b> <b>flavors</b> <b>of</b> added ingredients. The firm texture of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural flavor is reportedly similar to the peppery taste of watercress, or oysters. Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness. Specimens found under conifers can taste [...] "unpleasantly strong". The form amarum, locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages.|$|E

[...] Ashkenazi cholent often contains kishke (a sausage casing) or helzel (a chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture).
