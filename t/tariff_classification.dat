40|$|In many jurisdictions, {{international}} traders {{can apply}} to customs authorities for an advance ruling for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> before they import or export their goods. The advance ruling system for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is expected to grant more legal certainty to international traders because they can communicate with customs authorities and receive a legally binding <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> decision in advance. Such a system {{is important in the}} facilitation of international trade. In this paper, the advance ruling systems for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in the European Union (EU), China and Taiwan will be compared. It is shown that the advance ruling systems for <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in these three jurisdictions all emphasise the efficiency of customs administration more than the legitimate expectation and procedural rights of the applicants. This imbalance might result from the complicated nature of tariff classification; however, it can also make the advance ruling system less attractive for international traders to use...|$|E
30|$|Assessing product ‘likeness’ has in {{particular}} {{to take into account}} the products’ respective physical characteristics, end-uses, related consumer tastes and habits and <b>tariff</b> <b>classifications</b> [18]. From the standards established by WTO case law [15] it follows that articles with SVHC and articles without SVHC may often be deemed like products in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT. On the one hand, articles with SVHC frequently pose a certain risk to humans or the environment which is due to the exposure in the product life cycle that is in practice hardly avoidable. Similar products without SVHC do not pose corresponding risks, indicating as a result that the two products are not regarded as like products in terms of their properties, nature and quality. On the other hand, potential end-uses will, except in special cases, be identical for both products in principle. Moreover, data on consumer tastes and habits show that consumers in the EEA do not consistently prefer products without SVHC; rather, relevant market segments are likely to exist in which consumers perceive the compared articles as substitutable [19]. This may result in individual cases where there is evidence in favour of the likeness of the products.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{responsibilities}} of a customs administration is the collection of customs duties on imported goods. This necessitates the <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> of the goods in question. As a result of South Africa’s membership of the World Customs Organization, specific obligations in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> are incurred. <b>Tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is a highly technical and intricate undertaking, subject to both national and international law. Especially the implementation and application of the international provisions result in varying interpretations by stakeholders. This, inevitably, results in disputes. This article discusses the position in South Africa regarding customs <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> dispute resolution and compares the South African provisions and practices with those in Australia and Canada. The differences in the approach to dispute resolution in the three countries are critically analysed.

40|$|The {{field of}} customs is {{commonly}} referred to as that of imports and exports. It is perceived as a maze of processes, procedures, and forms required to enable a customs administration to perform their wide range of responsibilities. One of the responsibilities of a customs administration is the collection of duties, which necessitates classification of the goods in question. This study sets out {{to determine the extent of}} customs control in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> in South Africa. The starting point is the establishment of the foundations of customs, both internationally and in South Africa. After origin and valuation, <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> is the third technical customs-related focus area. An analysis of the responsibilities of the customs administration in South Africa confirms the importance of revenue collection and, subsequently, <b>tariff</b> <b>classification.</b> As a result of South Africa’s membership of the World Customs Organization, specific obligations in relation to <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> are incurred. The implementation and application of the international provisions are considered and compared in South Africa, Australia, and Canada. Not only is South Africa’s existing legislation considered, but also two new Acts. It is found that despite similarities in the implementation of the Harmonized System Convention into the legislation of the three countries, South Africa’s existing legislation makes the most detailed provision for the Harmonized System and its aids. This is based on the finding that the legislation in Australia and Canada, as well as the two new Acts in South Africa, do not have the same comprehensive provisions. A critical review of the varying processes of classification in the three countries suggests that more suitable and effective processes could be implemented in South Africa. In addition, a synopsis of some of the principles developed in case law is provided and compared. In relation to facilitation, the access to relevant information and the adequacy thereof, as well as the availability of rulings, are considered. Differences in the approach to dispute resolution in the three countries are furthermore provided. Proposals are made to address the discrepancies in the implementation and application of the legislation, the process of classification, the principles developed in case law, the enhancement of related guides, the publication of <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> rulings, and the extent of facilitation and dispute resolution. Finally it is recommended that an independent and expert tribunal is established to adjudicate technical customs matters. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} effect of tariff {{policies}} on evasion of customs duties, {{in the context of the}} trade reform in India of the 1990 s. By exploiting the variation in tariff rates across time and products, we identify a robust positive elasticity of evasion with respect to tariffs. A second contribution of the paper is to provide some evidence on the impact of enforcement. While we can not identify the direct impact of enforcement on evasion, we can establish the extent to which enforcement-related factors, such as product characteristics that determine the ease of detection of evasion, affect the evasion elasticity. The results render support to the hypothesis that improvements in enforcement can reduce the responsiveness of evasion to <b>tariffs.</b> JEL <b>Classification</b> Numbers...|$|R

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct preshipment inspections of imports, generating independent data on the value and <b>tariff</b> <b>classification</b> of incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in import duty collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the import duty improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in import duty collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.

40|$|Reliable {{methods are}} needed to detect the {{presence}} of tobacco components in tobacco products to effectively control smuggling and classify tariff and excise in tobacco industry to control illegal tobacco trade. In this study, two sensitive and specific DNA based methods, one quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay and the other loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, were developed for the reliable and efficient detection {{of the presence of}} tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in various tobacco samples and commodities. Both assays targeted the same sequence of the uridine 5 ′-monophosphate synthase (UMPS), and their specificities and sensitivities were determined with various plant materials. Both qPCR and LAMP methods were reliable and accurate in the rapid detection of tobacco components in various practical samples, including customs samples, reconstituted tobacco samples, and locally purchased cigarettes, showing high potential for their application in tobacco identification, particularly in the special cases where the morphology or chemical compositions of tobacco have been disrupted.
