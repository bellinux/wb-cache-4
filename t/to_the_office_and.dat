5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say something to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly {{was impressed by the}} screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton {{was unable}} to {{distinguish}} himself on the field while at school, but after joining Waverley, he made quick progress. Fingleton trained early in the morning, before heading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> working in the afternoon so that the articles would be printed in the evening. He {{was unable to}} afford the club membership so a patron sponsored him. At the age of 16, he broke into the First XI of a grade team which included Test players Alan Kippax, Hanson Carter and Arthur Mailey. Australian Test captain Herbie Collins missed a match due to {{his work as a}} bookmaker, and Fingleton stood in at late notice. Under the leadership of Carter, Fingleton batted last and made 11 not out. Forced to follow on, he made 52 not out and cemented his position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Within a year, Fingleton's grade performances were being reported in Sydney newspapers. Playing on a Waverley pitch notorious for uneven bounce, Fingleton developed a style of playe centred around solid defence.|$|E

5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces {{that he wants to}} make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie {{had anything to do with}} his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E

5|$|Members are {{assigned}} {{positions in the}} order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily a member of the Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical. As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E

25|$|Anstis {{was elected}} to Parliament again in January 1715 for Launceston.

In addition, on 30 September 1715 Anstis was arrested on suspicion of involvement in plotting a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall. A protracted legal battle ensued as Anstis and Vanbrugh both claimed the title of Garter. Anstis eventually emerged victorious in May 1718.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was erected around a rectangular central patio with arched galleries {{on all sides}} that serve as transitional elements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> room areas located throughout its periphery, {{all of which are}} typical of the period and style. A small fountain {{in the center of the}} patio served the dual purposes of ornamentation and water supply. This element no longer exists. The building was constructed of brick and a mixture of rubblework and stone. A series of symmetrically-placed thick walls carrying wooden beams, probably of ausubo or other Puerto Rican hard wood, support the brick roof. This structure has a basement, an uncommon element in this type of construction, on its south side.|$|E

25|$|During the 1964 UK general {{election}} campaign, an Irish republican candidate displayed an Irish tricolour {{from the window}} of his office in a republican area of Belfast. Paisley threatened that if the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not remove the tricolour he would lead a march <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> take it down himself. The Flags and Emblems Act banned the public display of any symbol, {{with the exception of the}} Union Flag, that could cause a breach of the peace. In response, armed officers arrived at the building, smashed their way inside and seized the flag. This led to severe rioting between republicans and the RUC. Thirty people, including at least 18 officers, had to be hospitalized. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Divis Street were the worst in Belfast since the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921, Snively became a {{candidate}} for mayor of Duluth, was elected, and kept the position {{for a total of}} sixteen years--a record for Duluth mayors. Snively was sixty-one years old when he was elected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> his first proclamation as mayor was his promise to make Duluth the most beautiful city in the Northwest, if not the country. The completion and promotion of Skyline Parkway, the city's hilltop boulevard, became Snively's personal project throughout his four terms in office. The idea for the city-wide boulevard is credited to William King Rogers of Ohio, who also oversaw construction of its initial segment from 1889 to 1891. After that, work on the boulevard fell off, and was piecemeal at best until Snively came into office. During his administration, the boulevard's expansion served as both a way to beautify the city and provide jobs during tough economic times in the 1930s.|$|E
