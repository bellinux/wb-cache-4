40|$|Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is an {{important}} alpha+beta titanium alloy with an interesting and challenging correlation between the mechanical properties and its complex microstructure. The microstructure presents a three dimension complexity with features at different scale levels (prior-beta grains and alpha/beta colonies in millimeter scale, and alpha laths at micrometer scale). Titanium alloys are also very sensible to small amounts of impurities (such as O, H and B) and recently {{it has been found}} that boron addition in small quantities refine the microstructure and improve some of the mechanical properties. However, the effect of boron in the microstructure and its correlation to mechanical properties is not well understood. In this work a quantitative characterization of microstructure parameters in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 11 B alloys is done. Furthermore, we characterize the microstructure at different ingot depths to observe the change of microstructure parameters through the solidification stages. The results show that the addition of boron (1) increases the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary alpha in 54 % and the thickness of alpha laths in 87 %. (2) Reduces the length of alpha laths in 15 %, which in turn reduces the alpha/beta colony size in 80 %, and the aspect ratio of alpha laths in 55 %. Throughout the ingots various microstructural features changed (1) on both alloys, the thickness of alpha laths decreases with the depth in the ingot. (2) In Ti- 64 - 0. 11 B alloy the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary alpha increases {{at the center of the}} ingot and (3) The alpha/beta colony size is increased with the depth of the ingot for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, but decreases slightly in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 11 B alloy.

30|$|In {{relatively}} slow shocks, vshock ~ 50 – 100 km s− 1, {{the grain}} destruction is primarily via grain-grain collisions {{caused by the}} betatron acceleration of the grains in the post-shock cooling region. This sort of destruction tends to erode any mantle the grains might have and shift the grain size distribution towards smaller grains. In faster shocks, thermal and non-thermal sputtering preferentially destroy smaller grains by removing the same <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> material regardless of grain size. In Fig. 6, left, we show the resulting depletions after shock passage for a core-mantle grain model wherein the core is silicate and mantle is pyroxene (from Frisch et al., 1999). The effects of shock passage depend on, in addition to assumptions about grain composition and structure, the gas density and magnetic field strength.|$|E
40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> {{boundaries}} on the electromechanical {{response of}} a ferroelectric polycrystal subjected to an electric field or stress is investigated numerically {{by using a}} phase field model. The grain boundaries in the phase field model are regarded as dielectrics in which the ferroelectric properties are degraded completely. The phase field simulations show that the presence <b>of</b> dielectric <b>grain</b> boundaries results in a large build-in depolarizing field in grains. The depolarizing field has a significant influence on the coercive field, the switching behaviour of ferroelectric domain under an electric field or stress, and the piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the ferroelectric polycrystal. It is found that both coercive field and remnant polarization decrease with the increase <b>of</b> the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> dielectric <b>grain</b> boundary. However, the piezoelectric coefficient and permittivity of the ferroelectric polycrystal become larger when the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> dielectric <b>grain</b> boundary increases. The enhancement of dielectric and piezoelectric properties by the dielectric grain boundary suggests a new degree of freedom to tune the electromechanical response of ferroelectric polycrystalline materials.

We can observe when the content of the Eu 3 + ions increases by ~ 10 times, the content of the Ca 2 + ions increases only by ~ 2 – 3 times.

40|$|In-situ testing, {{ultrasonic}} C-scans, and metallography {{were used}} {{to show that a}} crack-divider delamination form of thin-sheet toughening occurs in wrought Low Carbon Arc Cast (LCAC) unalloyed molybdenum, Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) molybdenum, and TZM molybdenum at temperatures {ge} the Ductile to Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT). Cracking along boundaries relieves mechanical constraint to free ligaments that may plastically stretch to produce toughening. Anisotropy in fracture toughness with lower values in the short-transverse direction is shown to produce the crack divider delaminations at the crack tip in the LT and TL orientations. The delamination zone increases with increasing stress-intensity to sizes significantly larger than the plastic zone, which leads to large increases in fracture toughness by the thin sheet toughening mechanism. Fracture in ODS Mo-alloys proceeds mainly along grain boundaries to produce small ligaments that exhibit ductility for both LT and TL orientations resulting in a lower DBTT and higher toughness values at lower temperatures than observed in LCAC and TZM. A combination <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary fracture and cleavage is prevalent in LCAC molybdenum and TZM.

40|$|The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> pericarp, {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} kernel, is an {{important}} breeding criterion for sorghum. This cereal is mainly used through traditional processing in family-based food systems in many regions of the world. We investigated in this study how pericarp thickness could be predicted by Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS), a fast and non-destructive measurement method that is commonly used to measure physico-chemical parameters of sorghum grains, and how this trait also influences the prediction of those parameters. We showed that, using a classification approach, {{it was possible to}} discriminate thick from thin pericarp whole grain samples with a good accuracy and that the proportion of thin and thick grains in mixed samples could also be predicted. In addition, pericarp thickness had a significant effect on the calibration performance for other grain parameters indicating that the pericarp can distort spectral information of whole grain samples. As a practical consequence, we suggest to develop separate whole grain calibration models for thin and thick pericarp samples, combined with a two-steps prediction approach to improve the accuracy of whole grain NIRS calibrations for grain quality parameters in sorghum.

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of {{temperature}} and heating rate upon the ageing response of a Ti- 6 Cr- 5 Mo- 5 V- 4 Al alloy was undertaken. The degree of strengthening declined with increasing ageing temperature as the precipitate morphologies became coarser, while the extent and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary alpha increased with temperature. Ageing at temperatures between 440 degrees C and 500 degrees C result in the greatest age hardening response in times of around 4 h due precipitation of the alpha phase. At 440 degrees C the hardness increases from the initial solution treated value of 275 Hv to more than 450 Hv. The rate of heating to reach the isothermal ageing temperature has a substantial impact on the ageing response. Greater scatter was observed in hardness results for the samples aged using a faster heating rate at 500 degrees C. For ageing at 560 degrees C a faster rate of heating to the ageing temperature led to rapid declines in the hardness after the peak, equivalent to around 20 % of the peak value. Slower heating rates (5 degrees C min(- 1)) appear {{to increase the number of}} nucleation sites for precipitation of the alpha phase, forming finer, more even distributions of precipitates. Faster heating rates (similar to 100 degrees C min(- 1)) produce coarser, less evenly distributed precipitates which coarsen more rapidly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{predict the}} {{contribution}} of eddy currents to power losses in polycrystalline Mn-Zn ferrites {{and apply it to}} experimental results obtained on a broad frequency range in different commercial materials and differently sized ring samples. It is verified by theory and experiment that the eddy currents can, in sufficiently large specimens, measurably contribute to the energy dissipation, in conjunction with spin damping mechanisms. In this context, the direct role of the domain wall processes is shown to be negligible, with the so-called classical losses, chiefly associated with the rotations, accounting for all of the eddy-current losses. To predict the frequency dependent classical loss Weddy (cl) (f) in the actual heterogeneous material, the electromagnetic field equations are formulated under a variational multiscale approach, with fine and coarse scales identified with the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundary layers and grain size, respectively. The eddy-current patterns are correspondingly observed to evolve, on increasing the magnetizing frequency, from mostly grain-confined to circulating on the scale of the sample cross-section. Based on the measurement of the electrical resistivity versus frequency and knowledge of the average grain size, an overall frequency dependence of the classical loss Weddy (cl) (f) is formulated. With the energy loss W(f) measured from dc to 10 MHz in different types of commercial Mn-Zn ferrites having different cross-sectional areas, it is found that the W(f) behaviors in a given material all tend to fall onto a single W(f) curve once purged of the calculated Weddy (cl) (f).

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 a, all grown {{structures}} show non-continuous film structures with grain-like morphologies surrounded with wide cracking structures. Recently, {{we have also}} observed the same tendency {{for the growth of}} SiC on single-layer graphene (SLG) where grain-like film structure was obtained [30]. However, {{in the case of the}} growth of SiC on graphene, the grain-like film structures are continuous without any cracking structure. As reported in ref. [30], the resulted grain structures are presumably due to the nature of grain-like structure of polycrystalline graphene used. The possible reason why the cracking is generated in this growth is speculated due to the stacking structures or uneven <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> MLG [34]. From the cross-sectional FESEM images shown in Fig.  2 b, it can be clearly seen that the sizes and the <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> deposited <b>grain</b> structures increase with the current densities. As can be seen in Fig.  2 b, the <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> deposited <b>grain</b> layer increase from 4.3 μm at current density of 0.5 mA/cm 2 to 6.1 μm at current density of 3.5 mA/cm 2. Also, the width of cracking structures also seems to increase with the current densities. In principle, we believe that the morphology of the grown structures is determined by the nature of grain-like structure of polycrystalline MLG. When the current densities are increased, the deposition rates of the grown layers increase resulting to the increase in the thicknesses. Such high deposition rates seem to be able to combine the small grain-like structures by covering the grain boundaries especially at the grain area with same graphene thicknesses or even with small difference <b>of</b> <b>thicknesses.</b> Thus, such mechanism leads to the formation of larger grain-like structures. The cracking structures are still being observed and not able to be eliminated presumably due to the large difference in the graphene thicknesses. The cracking structure becomes apparent due to thick deposited layer. Meanwhile, the EDX spectra (data not shown) confirmed that the grown films contain Ga, O, and N elements indicating the possible formation of GaON and Ga 2 O 3 structures.|$|R

These secondary phases are devitrified as crystalline Sc 2 Si 2 O 7. Deformation of the samples was dominated by cavitational processes rather than movements of dislocations. Thus the excellent deformation resistance of the samples at high temperature {{can be attributed to the}} very small <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary layers and the crystalline secondary phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of nanocrystalline aluminum {{has been studied}} using molecular dynamics simulation. Nanocrystalline models consisting <b>of</b> hexagonal <b>grains</b> with grain size d between 5 nm and 80 nm are deformed by the application of tension. A transition from grain-size hardening to grain-size softening {{can be observed in}} the region where d≈ 30 nm, which is the optimum grain size for strength. In the grain-size hardening region, nanocrystalline models primarily deform by intragranular deformation. Consequently, a pile-up of dislocations can be observed. When the grain size becomes less than 30 nm, where the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundaries cannot be neglected in comparison to the grain sizes, the dominant deformation mechanism of nanocrystalline metals is intergranular deformation by grain boundary sliding. Further, geometrical misfits by grain boundary sliding are accommodated by the grain rotation mechanism. Moreover, cooperative grain boundary sliding occurs in the 5 nm model. The optimum grain size is controlled by the relationship between resistance to intergranular deformation by grain boundary processes and intragranular deformation resisted by the grain boundary. Therefore, the primary role <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary changes in the region where the optimum grain size is observed. © 2005 The American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{is devoted}} to the brazing of {{aluminium}} using liquid gallium. Gallium was deposited on aluminium samples at similar to 50 degrees C using a liquid gallium "polishing" technique. Brazing was undertaken for 30 min at 500 degrees C in air. EDS (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) characterisation of Ga-coated samples has shown that the Ga surface layer <b>thickness</b> is <b>of</b> ten (or a few tens of) nanometres. Furthermore, aluminium oxide layer (Al 2 O 3) was shown to be "descaled" during Ga deposition, which ensures good conditions for further brazing. Cross-section examination of Ga-coated samples shows that liquid gallium penetrates into the aluminium grain boundaries during deposition. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary gallium film was measured using an original EDS technique and is found to be of a few tens of nanometres. The depth <b>of</b> gallium <b>grain</b> boundary penetration is about 300 mu m at the deposition temperature. The fracture stress of the brazed joints was measured from tensile tests and was determined to be 33 MPa. Cross-section examination of brazed joints shows that gallium has fully dissolved into the bulk and that the joint is really autogenous...|$|R
40|$|Summary. During {{micronisation}} {{grain moisture}} evaporates mainly in decreasing drying rate period. Grain layer {{located on the}} surface of the conveyor micronisers will be regarded as horizontal plate. Due to the fact that the micronisation process the surface <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> evaporates little moisture (within 2 - 7 %) is assumed constant plate thickness. Because in the process <b>of</b> micronization <b>grain</b> structure is changing, in order to achieve an exact solution of the equations necessary to take into account changes thermophysical, optical and others. Equation of heat transfer is necessary to add a term that is responsible for the infrared heating. Because <b>of</b> the small <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain,</b> neglecting the processes occurring at the edge <b>of</b> the <b>grain,</b> that is actually consider the problem of an infinite plate. To check the adequacy of the mathematical model of the process of micronisation <b>of</b> wheat <b>grain</b> moisture content must be comparable to the function of time, obtained by solving the system of equations with the measured experimental data of experience. Numerical solution of a system of equations for the period of decreasing drying rate is feasible with the help of the Maple 14, substituting the values of the constants in the system. Calculation of the average relative error does not exceed 7 - 10 %, and shows a good agreement between the calculated data and the experimental values...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of plastic {{strain on the}} shape, size and crystallographic orientation <b>of</b> ferrite (α) <b>grains</b> formed at the <b>grain</b> boundaries <b>of</b> the deformed austenite (γ) was studied in a 0. 17 C- 0. 3 Si- 1. 5 Mn steel. Specimens with a coarse γ <b>grain</b> size <b>of</b> 300 μm were compressed at 1023 K and cooled at 10 K/s. When the plastic strain increased to 0. 4, the shape <b>of</b> α <b>grains</b> changed from plate like to equiaxed, and the average length <b>of</b> α <b>grains</b> decreased from 12 to 6 μm. However, the average length did not change in the larger plastic strains up to 1. 1. On the other hand, the average <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> α <b>grains</b> was constant regardless of the plastic strain. The crystallographic orientations <b>of</b> the α <b>grains</b> formed at one γ grain boundary were almost the same when the plastic strain was smaller than 0. 2 and the α grain shape was plate like. However, the orientations were widely distributed, {{and most of the}} α/ α boundaries were high angle ones, when the plastic strain was larger than 0. 4 and the α grain shape was equiaxed. The shape change and α grain refinement by the deformation resulted from the wide distribution of crystallographic orientations <b>of</b> α <b>grains</b> rather than from the increase in the nucleation rate. The wide distribution of crystallographic orientation <b>of</b> α <b>grains</b> is closely associated with the serrated austenite grain boundaries induced by the deformation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{approach}} for measurement <b>of</b> local <b>thickness</b> and characterization <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries is presented. The method is embodied in a software tool {{that helps to}} find and set sample orientations useful for high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) examination <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries in polycrystalline thin films. The novelty is the simultaneous treatment of the two neighboring grains and orienting both grains and the boundary plane simultaneously. The same metric matrix-based formalism is used for all crystal systems. Input into the software tool includes orientation data for the grains in question, which is determined automatically for a large number <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> by the commercial ASTAR program. Grain boundaries suitable for HRTEM examination are automatically identified by our software tool. Individual boundaries are selected manually for detailed HRTEM examination from the automatically identified set. Goniometer settings needed to observe the selected boundary in HRTEM are advised by the software. Operation is demonstrated on examples from cubic and hexagonal crystal system...|$|R

In each coring site, some gravelly sand layers show overall normal grading (Figs.  5 a and 7), indicating that event layer III was deposited {{under the influence of}} flow. Moreover, a coarser fraction (particles larger than −[*] 3 ϕ) was not observed in the landward part of the transect (>[*] 588  m from the shoreline), as shown by the maximum grain sizes and their <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> the layers. <b>Grain</b> size becomes finer inland, and layers become thinner (Fig.  7), which indicates the transportation of material from the sea-side such as beach and/or ocean (Dawson 1994).|$|R
