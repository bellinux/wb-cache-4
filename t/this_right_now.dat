[...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us."

[...] They have this huge crushing demographic crisis {{as a result of}} the one-child policy. And if people don’t start having more children, they’re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population." [...] China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.|$|E

On other occasions, he stated he would wake up to find [...] "dead, strangled kids" [...] on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back. In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was [...] "crying, scared".

40|$|A {{characterization}} of the English present tense should, one would think, be simple and straightforward. What could be more basic than an indication of present time? And what could be simpler morphologically than its typical exponent, namely zero, {{the absence of any}} verbal inflection? Yet the English present is notorious for the descriptive problems it poses. Some would even refer to it as “the so-called present tense in English”, so called because a characterization in terms of present time seems hopelessly unworkable. On the one hand, it typically cannot be used for events occurring at the time of speaking. To describe what I am doing <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> I cannot felicitously use sentence (1) (a), with the simple present, but have to resort to the progressive, as in (1) (b).
