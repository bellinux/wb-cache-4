The English term Boer-hater was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, republicanism in the United Kingdom grew, {{partly on}} account of {{negative}} publicity associated with the Royal Family (for instance, immediately {{following the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales).

In the meantime, pressure from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>public</b> and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the build time for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>public</b> favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs.
