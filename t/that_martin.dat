50|$|Martins had {{an affair}} with the artist Marcel Duchamp, which lasted for several years from 1946 onwards, ending with her {{departure}} for Brazil and with his 1954 marriage to his second wife Alexina Duchamp. In 2009, members of Martins's family released letters written by Duchamp and <b>Martins</b> <b>that</b> substantiated previous claims <b>that</b> <b>Martins</b> was indeed the model for the nude figure in Duchamp's final masterpiece, the Étant donnés, as opposed to his wife Teeny. It is now widely acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>Martins</b> was the model for the reclining nude torso in Duchamp's installation piece and that his wife Teeny served only as the model for the figure's arms.|$|R

5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E
5|$|King's wife, Coretta Scott King, {{followed}} in her husband's footsteps and {{was active in}} matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006.

Along with the other items placed on him, an itinerary of his activity in London could be constructed from 18 to 24 April.|$|E
5|$|Voltaire {{develops}} no formal, systematic philosophy for {{the characters}} to adopt. The {{conclusion of the}} novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though what it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and {{the conclusion of the}} work in which Martin plays little part.|$|E
50|$|Martins Motorsports {{announced}} on February 9 {{a partnership with}} Brandonbilt Motorsports for the 2017 season. Brandon Brown will drive the No. 44 Chevrolet at 4 races.

They sold the owner points to Faith Motorsports.|$|R
50|$|Martins {{made his}} English Premier League debut on 27 August, in the 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa, {{in which he}} was stretchered off with a knee injury.

His unremarkable first few appearances for Newcastle caused manager Glenn Roeder to speak out in his defence.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1923 by Will Odee as a legal forms publisher. He stole the customer list from Martin Stationery {{at the time of}} being employed there.

5|$|Watts later shows Black {{a picture}} {{taken at the}} murder scene, with Sammael {{recognizable}} among a crowd of people. Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Blomkvist's {{daughter}} Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) visits him {{and notes}} that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander {{based on the work}} she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 April 2014 it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Martins</b> had signed a two-year contract with I-League runners-up East Bengal.

5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The GAO {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated <b>that</b> <b>Martin</b> had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E
50|$|On 11 March 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Martins</b> signed with MLS club Seattle Sounders FC as a Designated Player after the club paid a $4 million buyout clause in Martins' contract with Levante.
