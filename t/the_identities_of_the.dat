5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{shown in}} Mutoscope {{machines}} in arcades, Sherlock Holmes Baffled has a running time of 30 seconds. Although produced in 1900, {{it was only}} registered in 1903, and a copyright notice stating this is seen on some prints. <b>The</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actors playing the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded. Assumed to be lost for many years, the film was rediscovered in 1968 as a paper print in the Library of Congress.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Hemlock Hoax {{was based on}} a minor character from a film story that had been rejected. The finished film was released in April as a split reel, being presented with two other Lubin comedies. The black-and-white short received positive reviews with several journalists praising the film's humor. It is unclear whether there is a surviving print of the film, and <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's cast and crew are not recorded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E

5|$|BGSU's {{official}} mascots are Freddie and Frieda Falcon. Freddie Falcon {{began appearing}} at athletic events in 1950, while Frieda {{first appeared on}} February 25, 1966 as Mrs. Freddie Falcon. Frieda returned in the 1980–81 academic year as Freddie’s little sister. 1980 marked the first official female Frieda after the 1966 version was played by a male cheerleader. Freddie and Frieda routinely make appearances at BGSU athletic events and other major events around campus and the community.

Escaping from the prison, Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when the plane is attacked by a Mexican drug cartel. Fourth Echelon restarts the plane with Kobin's help, and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana.|$|E
40|$|This project aims to {{investigate}} a correlation between everyday lies in the social context and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar. It explores the influence lying can have on <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lie and how one intentionally can use lying in the everyday life to conceal potential stigmatising information about oneself. The theorists employed on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> lying are <b>the</b> psychologist Paul Ekman and philosopher Sissela Bok. We have furthermore included psychologist Carsten René Jørgensen and sociologist Erving Goffman on <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> and stigma respectively. <b>The</b> analysis is based on three made-up and stereotypical examples with <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> investigating different outcomes of different lies {{and their impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender with the conceptual framework from the theory adapted to <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> research. <b>The</b> study discusses the results from the analysis and proposes a possible connection between lying in everyday life and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender. The paper concludes that lies can be used to either maintain or develop <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender. On the other hand, lying can make the liar/sender seem less trustworthy in <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver(s) and challenge <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender...|$|R

Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court {{that he had taken}} the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|Frawley, {{who also}} served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed {{approach}} to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes. During the assembling of Frawley's films, the sole material for editors to rely on was a pad with notes scrawled in it. <b>The</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are unrecorded. The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia. It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901.|$|E

Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicized in May 2013. In addition, {{researchers}} have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.|$|E
5|$|Metro Transit began {{planning}} a bus tunnel through downtown Seattle in the 1970s, to be eventually converted to use by light rail trains.

The tunnel would be completed by 1989 and feature public art and stations designed to match <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area; the tunnel station at Union Station would be designed around an Asian motif reflecting the International District.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, {{but in practice}} ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. <b>The</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E

5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption {{of power in}} 1295. This is {{in part because the}} two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E

Kansas Saloon Smashers marked {{one of the first}} short films to be created under Fleming and Porter's partnership. While none of <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who appeared in the picture are recorded, it is known the women in the film were played by men in drag, rendering them sexually unattractive.|$|E
