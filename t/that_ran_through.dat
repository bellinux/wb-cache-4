5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running on Rainier Avenue between Downtown Seattle and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport that stopped in Columbia City. After the $6.7 billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9 billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a light rail line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> the Rainier Valley, with an elevated station on Rainier Avenue South at South Edmunds Street in Columbia City.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) was a {{business}} loop <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> downtown Mason.

From there, the business loop ran northward along Hull Road, becoming Jefferson Street. At the intersection with M-36 (Ash Street), Bus. US127 turned westward and ran concurrently with M-36. After four blocks and a crossing of the Sycamore Creek, Bus.

5|$|Hisar was {{occupied}} by George Thomas, an Irish adventurer, in 1798. The arrangement continued until 1801, when Thomas was driven out by the Sikh-Maratha-French confederacy. The region came {{under the rule of}} British East India Company in 1803 and remained a part until the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when Muhammad Azim and Rao Tula Ram conquered it away for a short period. The company sent forces under General Van Cortlandt, who defeated Azim and Tula Ram on 16 November 1857. Between 1803 and 1879, British constructed a 4,000-km-long Great Hedge of India, for levying the customs duty on salt and sugar, <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> Hisar and Hansi. Hisar became a municipality in 1867.|$|E

5|$|M-28 was {{transferred}} to a new roadway south of Newberry in late 1935 or early 1936 as shown on the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) maps of the time. The segment of roadway between the new highway and downtown Newberry was given the M-28A designation. In downtown Newberry, M-28A followed M-48 south, returning to M-28. Between late 1949 and early 1950, M-48 was rerouted on its west end. The former M-48 <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> downtown Newberry north to Roberts Corner {{was part of a}} relocated M-117. The M-28A designation was also changed to Bus. M-28 at this time on the map, creating an M-117/Bus. M-28 concurrency in place of the older M-28A/M-48 one.|$|E

Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E

5|$|By {{this period}} of the conflict, the number of German {{divisions}} remaining on the Western Front was rapidly declining, both in numbers and quality, a fact in the Allies' favour. By the night of 23 March, Montgomery had the equivalent of more than 30 divisions under his command, while the Germans fielded around 10 divisions, all weakened from constant fighting. The best German formation the Allied airborne troops would face was the 1st Parachute Army, although even this formation had been weakened from the losses it had sustained in earlier fighting, particularly when it had engaged Allied forces in the Reichswald Forest in February. First Parachute Army had three corps stationed along the river; 2nd Parachute Corps to the north, 86th Corps in the centre, and 63rd Corps in the south. Of these formations, 2nd Parachute Corps and 86th Corps had a shared boundary <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>through</b> the proposed landing zones for the Allied airborne divisions, meaning that the leading formation of each corps — these being 7thParachute Division and 84thInfantry Division — would face the airborne assault. After their retreat to the Rhine both divisions were under-strength and did not number more than 4,000 men each, with 84thInfantry Division supported by only 50 or so medium artillery pieces.|$|E
