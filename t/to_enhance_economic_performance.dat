We use this notion to design an economic MPC controller that exploits the inherent robustness {{of a stable}} auxiliary MPC controller <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance.</b> Specifically, we incorporate a flexible stabilizing constraint to the economic MPC formulation that preserves stability of the auxiliary controller. We use multiobjective optimization concepts {{to argue that the}} dual variable of the stabilizing constraint can be interpreted as a price of stability and we establish an equivalence between the proposed controller and regularized economic MPC controllers. We demonstrate that nontrivial gains in economic performance can be achieved without compromising stability...|$|E

40|$|Improved {{nutrient}} utilization {{efficiency is}} strongly related <b>to</b> <b>enhanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance</b> and reduced environmental footprint of dairy farms. Pasture-based systems {{are widely used}} for dairy production in {{certain areas of the}} world, but prediction equations of fresh grass nutritive value (nutrient digestibility and energy concentrations) are limited. Equations to predict digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) used for grazing cattle have been either developed with cattle fed conserved forage and concentrate diets or sheep fed previously frozen grass, and the majority of them require measurements less commonly available to producers, such as nutrient digestibility. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to develop prediction equations more suitable to grazing cattle for nutrient digestibility and energy concentrations, which are routinely available at farm level by using grass nutrient contents as predictors. A study with 33 nonpregnant, nonlactating cows fed solely fresh-cut grass at maintenance energy level for 50 wk was carried out over 3 consecutive grazing seasons. Freshly harvested grass of 3 cuts (primary growth and first and second regrowth), 9 fertilizer input levels, and contrasting stage of maturity (3 to 9 wk after harvest) was used, thus ensuring a wide representation of nutritional quality. As a result, a large variation existed in digestibility of dry matter (0. 642 - 0. 900) and digestible organic matter in dry matter (0. 636 - 0. 851) and in concentrations of DE (11. 8 - 16. 7 MJ/kg of dry matter) and ME (9. 0 - 14. 1 MJ/kg of dry matter). Nutrient digestibilities and DE and ME concentrations were negatively related to grass neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents but positively related to nitrogen (N), gross energy, and ether extract (EE) contents. For each predicted variable (nutrient digestibilities or energy concentrations), different combinations of predictors (grass chemical composition) were found to be significant and increase the explained variation. For example, relatively higher R(2) values were found for prediction of N digestibility using N and EE as predictors; gross-energy digestibility using EE, NDF, ADF, and ash; NDF, ADF, and organic matter digestibilities using N, water-soluble carbohydrates, EE, and NDF; digestible organic matter in dry matter using water-soluble carbohydrates, EE, NDF, and ADF; DE concentration using gross energy, EE, NDF, ADF, and ash; and ME concentration using N, EE, ADF, and ash. Equations presented may allow a relatively quick and easy prediction of grass quality and, hence, better grazing utilization on commercial and research farms, where nutrient composition falls within the range assessed in the current study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} risks and {{benefits}} of holding company stock in employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) retirement plans. We address three questions: (1) What is the role and function of company stock in such plans? (2) Who might be affected by enhanced portfolio diversification in such plans? and (3) What mechanisms exist, or might be developed, to enhance portfolio diversification if more diversification were deemed useful? Firms offer company stock within DC plans in an effort <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance,</b> though evidence is mixed on productivity gains from stock ownership. We demonstrate that concentrated stock positions arise most often in larger firms' DC plans where sponsors direct employer contributions and restrict diversification. Stock concentration also arises because participants systematically underestimate the risk of employer stock and over-rely on its past performance in making investment decisions. In a retirement system with concentrated stock positions, there will always be some participants who forfeit DC plan savings to firm bankruptcy. Encouraging plan diversification mitigates this risk, but it could also induce some companies to redirect plan contributions to other forms of stock compensation or to replace stock contributions with cash compensation. We conclude by describing policy tools that might be used to encourage diversification and discuss conditions for their effective implementation. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} social capital is useful for {{explaining}} the application of location strategy. When selecting a location to conduct trading related activities, business firms tend to select a region with resources {{that allow them to}} reduce their trade cost. At the regional or national level, policy makers have developed measures to attract business operators to invest in a certain location by improving the shipping networks to reduce trade cost so as <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance.</b> The two dimensions of location are place and space. According to Beugelsdijk & Mudambi (2012), place is a “geographical unit of analysis” and space is spatial variation which is “any characteristic that generates variation among places”. Spatial variation can be viewed at both the macro and micro levels of economic activities. In a highly competitive economy, policy makers {{play an important role in}} developing trade facilitation measures to boost trade related activities at the macro level (Loannou & Serafeim 2012). For instance, the efficiency of customs and border management clearance is an effective measure that traders use to gauge the transport goods for international trade. To enhance transport related activities to provide logistics services that enhance the efficiency of trade related activities, it is desirable to provide high quality trade and transport infrastructures. The availability of TF-MA is therefore important for actors in their decision of selecting a location to conduct their business activities.|$|E

Variations in performance scores among the FMGs were analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance while multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors that influence their perception of the performance. The results reveal significant differences in performance scores among FMGs. Members of some FMGs perceived that the participatory forest management program enabled them to get benefits from the sale of fuelwood while performance scores in the forest conservation and decision-making processes is generally poor. The score for economic performance of FMGs in turn was related to better access to roads and markets. Group size tended <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance</b> via its strong influence on annual fuelwood harvest, while the resource base appeared to be inconsequential.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and Sanford Klein; 255 pp. The use of simulations can greatly aid in optimizing the design of natural convection heat exchangers (NCHEs) in solar domestic hot water (SDHW) systems. Fraser et al. (1992) presented a NCHE model that {{is used in the}} WATSUN solar simulation program, that requires experimental measurements of the heat exchanger thermal performance and shear pressure losses. Two TRNSYS models are here presented for a NCHE in a SDHW loop. The simple model, based on Fraser et al. 's work, requires experimental testing on the particular heat exchanger. The simple model can be used for optimizing SDHW system parameters (i. e. pipe lengths and diameters, collector areas, tank volume etc.) excluding the NCHE itself which is represented by the experimental curves. A detailed model, based upon cross flow correlations, requires geometric specifications of the NCHE being simulated and is applicable to shell and coil and counterflow configurations. By varying heat exchanger geometric parameters (such as the number of helices, diameters of helices, diameter and length of the heat exchanger shell) the detailed model can be used to design an optimum NCHE. Results comparing the detailed model with Fraser et al. 's experiments show reasonable agreement. Using the detailed model and the least cost savings economic analysis, simulations were performed to discover the optimal shell and coil NCHE geometry. It was found that considerably reducing the heat exchanger size led <b>to</b> <b>enhanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance</b> over a 10 year period of economic analysis. Coil spacing and tube diameter had a lesser impact upon system performance than heat exchanger shell length and number of helices. Thermo Dynamics Inc. manufactures a shell and coil NCHE that contains 4 coils and is 0. 635 m. The optimal heat exchanger design contains 2 helices and is 0. 45 m long. For a given set of system parameters, a SDHW system containing the optimally designed heat exchanger would save the consumer an extra $ 110 in initial equipment cost, and $ 52 over a 10 year period. Heat exchanger designs were subject to variations in system parameters, such as collector area, hot water draw, location and glycol flow rate. Although each set of system parameters suggested a different optimal design, overall, the optimal design found for the initial set of system parameters remained adequate. As different economic assumptions will lead to differing optimal heat exchanger lengths, this work can serve as a guide for those who desire to optimize a shell and coil NCHE based upon a prevailing set of economic assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{performance}} of public organizations (POs) in developing countries. Despite {{the fact that the}} advantages of innovation and learning orientation to organizations have been evidently documented in Western economies and private owned enterprises, there has been little research into these practices and their impact on enhancing competitive advantages in POs in transitional economies such as Iran. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the effect of innovation and learning orientation on performance of POs in Iran. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on theory from innovation and learning orientation in conjunction with a strategic-centered model to carry out a survey-based study of 127 senior level managers (e. g. CEOs, planning, finance, HR and marketing managers) of POs and/or their cluster companies in six major developed and developing cities of Iran. Findings – The research findings show that learning orientation and innovativeness leads to better PO performance and should be encouraged. More specifically, the results suggest that higher levels of learning orientation and innovativeness led these organizations to higher levels of delivery speed, cost improvement, and quality confidence in firm future PO performance. Research limitations/implications – Data were gathered via a questionnaire administered to senior level managers of some POs and/or their clusters in some cities in Iran. Further research is required to understand the contextual factors that influence internal company culture. For example, there are relatively few women in managerial positions in Iranian companies; and the impact of a restricted business environment appears to vary from service to retail and manufacturing industries. Practical implications – This study is important for managers of public sectors. From empirical evidence, the authors found that PO managers must consider innovativeness and learning as two crucial strategic capabilities for a superior and sustainable performance. Originality/value – The study provides insights into the types of activities that PO management should undertake in order <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Preventing the {{environmental}} impacts of economic growth is an important goal in today’s marketplace. This concern for a sustainable future incentivises marketing based around sustainability. The food and beverage industry had its fair share of criticism as its production uses more natural resources than most industries. One industry that has been ahead of other food processors in adopting environmental practices is the wine industry. The close relationship between wine and places is undisputable and so strong that people frequently visit places of wine production in the form of wine tourism contributing significantly to regional economies. For wine to be associated with sustainability, regional stakeholders would be required to represent similar values. The branding of places is far more intricate than branding of products and needs the support of those stakeholders involved. Such support is often discussed as a shared place identity. Only limited previous research has addressed whether the communication of sustainability enhances business performance. No research to date has empirically tested whether a shared stakeholder identity influences the relationship between sustainability branding and business success. To close this gap, a sequential mixed methods procedure was specified using quantitative questionnaires with 420 subjects and 20 qualitative interviews. A model with consequences of sustainability branding and a shared place identity was established using extant research. Mostly existing scales were adapted to fit this research context and tested with a structural modelling approach among Australian and German wineries. It was found that practicing and communicating sustainability significantly influences performance on an individual winery and regional destination level. Furthermore, a shared place identity has been established as a critical success factor in the relationship between sustainability branding and place performance. Both theoretical and practical implications can be drawn from this research. The results have provided empirical evidence on the direct relationship between sustainability and performance, in addition to the moderating role of a shared place identity. These findings extend the tourism literature which states that businesses practicing sustainably, enhance their own performance as well as the overall regional performance. It also extends stakeholder theory by establishing that a shared place identity strengthens this relationship even further, highlighting the need for regional management to initiate a shared sense of identification. Practically, regional managers who are eager <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance</b> should be actively involved in developing relationships between the individual wineries and the regional management in order to foster a shared place identity. Furthermore, it is of major importance to establish positive attitudes toward sustainability among winery owners.

40|$|Innovation in {{a public}} sector context {{has been defined as}} the ‘creation and {{implementation}} of new processes, products, services and methods of delivery which result in significant improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness or quality of outcomes’. In short, innovation is the application of new ideas to produce better outcomes. Innovative activity in the public sector can be considered in various ways. Three common streams are: shaping policy directions — where the role of the public sector is to provide objective and reasoned advice, and options, to assist the Government’s decision-making in relation to policies and programs; implementing policies and programs — that is, delivering services to the Australian community efficiently and effectively; and administrative innovations — introducing new internal processes and practices to improve productivity/reduce costs. The benefits of innovation are diverse. It is widely recognised that innovation is crucial <b>to</b> <b>enhanced</b> <b>economic</b> <b>performance,</b> social welfare and environmental sustainability. Innovations can also improve organisational efficiency; provide higher quality and more timely services to citizens; reduce business transaction costs; and provide new methods of operation. Innovation can enable better performance and drive new directions.   This Guide has been developed {{in the context of the}} legislative, regulatory, monitoring and reporting framework that currently applies in the Australian government public sector. The Guide’s focus is on the culture and practices that can be adopted within the current framework to encourage and facilitate innovation in the public sector. There are other Government review processes underway dealing with the development of options and longer term issues for the public service. The Management Advisory Committee’s examination of public sector innovation will explore how innovation can be further facilitated on an ongoing basis and the need for possible reforms. The Prime Minister has also established an Advisory Group to develop a blueprint for reform of the public service. These exercises will, among other things, consider the adequacy of the current framework and where changes may be required. The Guide has been developed through a review of relevant academic, professional and government literature (including international experience), discussions with a cross-section of leaders, predominantly from the public sector, information obtained through case studies and professional experience. The interviews and case studies were important sources for better understanding the tacit knowledge held by experienced practitioners within the APS. Summaries of the agency case studies, key themes from the interviews with leaders and a summary of the literature review are set out in the Guide’s appendices. This material is intended to be a resource for readers, while also setting out the Guide’s foundations. In addition to the Guide, the ANAO has also prepared two supplements providing details on the innovation case studies and the full report of the literature review. The literature review supplement contains extensive material on overseas perspectives on innovation and overseas practice. The two supplements to the Guide, entitled Detailed Case Study Material from Agencies and Public Sector Innovation: A Review of the Literature are available through the ANAO website: www. anao. gov. au.  ...|$|R
40|$|Among other {{financial}} inflows, {{foreign direct investment}} makes a major stimulus to economic growth in many developing countries. The {{ability to deal with}} two major obstacles, namely, the shortages of financial resources and the lack of technology and skills, has put foreign direct investments in the centre of attention for policy-makers, particularly in developing countries. Albania is committed to maintaining an open environment for investments. This is vital for a long-term and sustainable economic growth. As a lowsavings developing economy, with high domestic investment requirements, Albania needs to attract foreign direct investment in order to support domestic investment financing requirements. However, Albania has not been successful in obtaining substantial and consistent FDI inflows. Furthermore, the meagre inflows that the country has received have not been utilized appropriately <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>performance.</b> The type of FDI and its structural composition matter as much for economic growth. This paper reviews the recent evidence on the scale of FDI to Albania. The paper reviews also some of the main areas of the existing policy framework for inward FDI in Albania among the major factors determining foreign companies' decisions to invest in Albania. We discuss these issues and try {{to make the case for}} a more coherent, harmonized and transparent framework to cover all foreign direct investment into Albania. The regulation of inward investment is one of several policy and institutional variables likely to influence the volume of FDI...|$|R
40|$|The British film {{industry}} {{has long been}} characterised as highly volatile, chronically unstable and liable to recurrent crises. The traditional policy response up until the 1980 s involved support through a mixture of quotas, fiscal support and industry levies. During the 1980 s this policy stance was reversed as deregulation and the exposure of the industry to market forces were seen as key <b>to</b> <b>enhancing</b> its <b>economic</b> <b>performance.</b> More recently, a new policy preoccupation with, and orientation to, the {{film industry}} has emerged. The film industry on this view is characterised as possessing inherent but unrealised potential which it {{is the role of}} government, albeit operating in tandem with the market, to unlock. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine more precisely the nature of this emerging 'competitiveness policy', using film as a focus for a conceptual and theoretical examination of the issues involved. We explore the relationship between competitiveness and organisational form and consider the potential of various kinds of policy intervention to transform the prospects of a sector such as film in the face of the weight of its historical development. We suggest that a 'path-dependent' perspective on competitiveness supports the belief that policy can most effectively operate through identifying the distinctive capabilities of British producers and by promoting 'structural' change, that is to say, the development of forms of contractual cooperation which can allow for the effective management of risk and uncertainty. The success of film policy in promoting organisation innovations of this kind will show whether, in a wider context, competitiveness policy can succeed in its goal of moving the market 'in the right direction'. ...|$|R
40|$|The issues {{analyzed}} {{in the present}} thesis {{are related to the}} economic interrelations between the characteristics of intermediate inputs, and the firms' performances such as export propensity and efficiency. The inputs employed by the firms in the production process play a determinant role for the firm's life cycle. The research's issues do not regard only the simple use of intermediate goods, but it is also considered the accessibility to the input markets, and the degree of competition. After a general introduction about the main framework, in chapter one it is analyzed the impact of import activity on the efficiency of manufacturing firms. We emphasize the role of foreign input as a key factor that determines productivity growth at firm level. In chapter two we focus our attention on a specific input: services. Given that in the developed economies services form an increasing proportion of the inputs employed in manufactures, the chapter provides an extensive analysis of input output linkages between services and manufactures. In particular the market structure of services and the average level of competition are central for the competitiveness of manufacturing firms. Finally in the third chapter, the importance of internal source of financing is {{analyzed in}} relation with firm’s investments decision: a particular attention is devoted to the investments necessary to cover the fixed costs associated with the export activity. With the topics covered in the present work, we contribute to the empirical industrial organization debate, with particular attention to trade activities. We show that the production process’s inputs, and their accessibility could be important factors <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>performances</b> at firm level. status: publishe...|$|R
