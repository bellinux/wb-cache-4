5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> gave humans {{the opportunity to develop}} a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization. Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> valley {{through the end of the}} Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on <b>the</b> <b>Nile,</b> in May 1217. Although they {{seized a}} strategically-important tower {{on a nearby}} island on 24 August, Al-Kamil (who had succeeded Al-Adil I in Egypt) {{controlled}} traffic on <b>the</b> <b>Nile.</b> In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III's legate Cardinal Pelagius (who considered himself the crusade's supreme commander) arrived from Italy.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Blue <b>Nile,</b> which {{originates}} at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, provides {{on average}} some 58% of <b>the</b> <b>Nile's</b> Egyptian waters. This river has a steeper gradient and therefore flows more swiftly than <b>the</b> White <b>Nile,</b> which it joins at Khartoum. Unlike <b>the</b> White <b>Nile,</b> <b>the</b> Blue <b>Nile</b> carries {{a considerable amount}} of sediment. For several kilometres north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from <b>the</b> Blue <b>Nile,</b> is visibly muddy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from <b>the</b> White <b>Nile,</b> is clearer.|$|R

The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north with <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> river {{protecting his}} right flank and the Azande cavalry contingent on his left. At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> and a parallel river. There was one clear path through the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{equated with}} Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty {{as soon as they}} arrived in <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> valley north of Gebelein. According to Manetho as reported by Josephus in Against Apion, Salitis reigned from Memphis, and fortified the existing town of Avaris, which was to become the Hyksos' seat of power.|$|E

50|$|The {{much shorter}} Atbarah River, which also {{originates}} in Ethiopia, joins <b>the</b> main <b>Nile</b> north of Khartoum between {{the fifth and}} sixth cataracts (areas of steep rapids) and provides about 14% of <b>the</b> <b>Nile's</b> waters in Egypt. During the low-water season, which runs from January to June, the Atbarah shrinks {{to a number of}} pools. But, in late-summer, when torrential rains fall on the Ethiopian Highlands, the Atbarah provides 22% of <b>the</b> <b>Nile's</b> flow.|$|R
5|$|Several {{churches and}} palaces, {{including}} Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities. In 1797, the Treaty of Tolentino {{was signed by}} Napoleon, and two statues, <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> and Tiber, were taken to Paris. These statues had previously been in the Vatican, and both were housed in the Louvre until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> was returned to Italy. However, the Tiber remained in the Louvre Museum and {{can be seen in}} the collections today.|$|E

50|$|Lake Albert {{is part of}} the {{complicated}} system of <b>the</b> upper <b>Nile.</b> Its main sources are <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Nile,</b> ultimately coming from Lake Victoria to the southeast, and the Semliki River, which issues from Lake Edward to the southwest. The water of <b>the</b> Victoria <b>Nile</b> is much less saline than that of Lake Albert. Its outlet, at the northernmost tip of the lake, is <b>the</b> Albert <b>Nile,</b> which becomes known as <b>the</b> Mountain <b>Nile</b> when it enters South Sudan.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> White <b>Nile,</b> {{which begins}} at Lake Victoria in Uganda, {{supplies}} about 28% of <b>the</b> <b>Nile's</b> Egyptian waters. In its course from Lake Victoria to Juba in South Sudan, <b>the</b> White <b>Nile's</b> channel drops more than 600 m. In its 1,600-km course from Juba to Khartoum, Sudan's capital, the river descends just 75 m.

5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
