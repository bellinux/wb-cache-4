5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. <b>The</b> <b>chick</b> may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> has departed. During the last few days underground, <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. <b>The</b> <b>chick</b> finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is brooded by {{a parent}} {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed <b>the</b> <b>chick.</b> In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by the water temperature, which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
50|$|They {{generally}} lay three eggs {{at about}} two-day intervals. If {{the food supply}} is not adequate, the third egg will be smaller and <b>the</b> third <b>chick</b> will also be smaller and at a disadvantage relative to its larger siblings. Chicks have a hook on the upper mandible, which disappears {{by the time of}} fledging. If the food supply to <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> is not adequate, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> will quarrel, with the hook being used as a weapon. <b>The</b> smallest <b>chick</b> may even be killed by its larger siblings. If food is plentiful, the parent birds spend more time brooding <b>the</b> <b>chicks,</b> so <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are not able to fight.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> and <b>the</b> female {{are too big}} for the nest, {{the mother}} breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the fact that she}} is imprisoned; the female will shed all of her flight and tail feathers simultaneously and regrow them in during the time she stays with <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are half-grown, <b>the</b> female will break out of the nest in order to help <b>the</b> male. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> will rebuild <b>the</b> wall themselves and continue to be fed through the slits by the parents. Once <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are fully grown, they will break out of the nest and start flying.|$|R
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 {{hours of}} each other and can be preceded by <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before {{hatching}}. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the mouth is silvery.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed <b>the</b> <b>chick,</b> {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E
50|$|After hatching, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> {{are led by}} {{the parents}} to nearby cover or refuge. Some chicks however do stay in the nest for one day. The parents feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks,</b> flying up to nearly 1 km away with food in <b>the</b> bill. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> then run out to be fed, {{probably}} in response to calls by the parents.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> and <b>the</b> female {{are too big}} to fit in the nest, {{the mother}} breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The nestlings {{remain in}} the nest for a period ranging between 53 and 67 days with {{one or the other}} parent {{spending}} up to 98% of their time brooding <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> in <b>the</b> first week with this reducing rapidly and ceasing when <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are about 25 days old. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> reach <b>the</b> stage of independence after about three months.|$|R
5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed for the lack of availability of the herring which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. <b>The</b> <b>chick</b> mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the {{offspring}} {{from a previous}} season will help in raising <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> If a helper bird returns with food, it will give {{it to one of}} the resident parents to feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> of {{swallows}} hatch naked, generally {{with only}} a few tufts of down. The eyes are closed and do not fully open for up to 10 days. The feathers take a few days to begin to sprout, and <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are brooded by the parents until they are able to thermoregulate. On the whole they develop slowly compared to other passerine birds. The parents do not usually feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> individual insects but instead a bolus of food comprising ten to a hundred insects. Regardless of whether the species has males that incubate or brood <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> <b>the</b> males of all swallows and martins will help feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> It is difficult to judge when swallows and martins fledge, as they will be enticed out of the nest after three weeks by parents but frequently return to the nest afterwards in order to roost.|$|R
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> of <b>the</b> higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|R
5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to be attacked {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their chick from attack, although it may be more passive if <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> is sickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
5|$|To the Stars is {{an album}} by American jazz fusion group <b>the</b> <b>Chick</b> Corea Elektric Band, {{released}} on August 24, 2004 by Stretch Records. Jazz musician Chick Corea, a longtime {{member of the}} Church of Scientology, was inspired by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction 1954 novel To the Stars. Hubbard's book {{tells the story of}} an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of time dilation due to traveling at near light speed. A few days experienced by the ship's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Both {{parents will}} raise the chicks; however, the male will leave {{after a couple of}} months when <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are about three-quarters grown. Initially the young will ride on the parents back, hidden between their {{slightly}} raised wings. When <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> begin to dive and feed themselves (at about 10 weeks) the mother may leave too, although mothers have been known to return soon after, apparently to check on <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its two {{or three}} eggs are not incubated, but are buried in warm sand, {{temperature}} control being achieved by the adult sitting on the eggs with a water-soaked belly to cool them. If the adult leaves the nest, it smooths sand over the eggs, though if it is frightened the job may be hasty. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are precocial, and can run {{as soon as they}} are hatched and feed themselves shortly afterwards. The adults cool <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> in <b>the</b> same way as with <b>the</b> eggs. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> may drink water from the adult's belly feathers. The adults bury <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> in <b>the</b> sand temporarily if danger threatens.|$|R
50|$|The female {{keel-billed toucan}} will lay 1-4 white {{eggs in a}} natural or already-made tree cavity. The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 15-20 days after being laid. After hatching, {{the male and female}} again take turns feeding <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for approximately 3 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> have adequately formed heel pads, which assist on the pit-covered bottom of <b>the</b> nest. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> stay in their nest for approximately eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully and they are ready to fledge from the nest.|$|R
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named <b>The</b> <b>Chick</b> Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars from the small company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch, <b>the</b> {{birds will}} desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|R
50|$|Both species lay 3-5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> of <b>the</b> higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed by both parents and fledge in 29-31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31-41 days for red-billed.|$|R
5000|$|During incubation, {{the female}} lays {{three to six}} white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off with a plaster of mud, {{droppings}} and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> and <b>the</b> female are {{too big for the}} nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic puffin is {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of four to five years. The birds are colonial nesters, {{excavating}} burrows on grassy clifftops or reusing existing holes, and may also nest in crevices and amongst rocks and scree on occasion. It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding <b>the</b> <b>chick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. <b>The</b> <b>chick</b> guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} 36–48 hours apart, and incubation, mainly by the female, {{starts with the}} first egg. The male may {{incubate}} for short periods, especially around dawn or dusk, but spends the day roosting, sometimes outside his territory or close to other males. If the female is disturbed while breeding, she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away. She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill. Each egg hatches after about 17–21 days. The semi-precocial downy chicks are mobile when hatched, but are brooded to keep them warm. They fledge in 16–17 days and become independent of the adults around 32days after hatching. A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs, {{in which case the}} female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second. Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick's mouth or pecked by <b>the</b> <b>chick</b> from the adult's open bill.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} six days after <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> hatch, <b>the</b> adults and <b>chicks</b> stay in <b>the</b> nesting sites. At around seven to twelve days old, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> begin {{to move out of}} their nests and explore their surroundings. When they are two weeks old, <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> congregate in groups, called [...] "microcrèches", and their parents leave them alone. After a while, the microcrèches merge into [...] "crèches" [...] {{containing}} thousands of chicks. Chicks that do not stay in their crèches are vulnerable to predators.|$|R
50|$|These pair-living birds lay 2 - 4 brown-spotted green {{eggs in a}} tree nest. Only {{the female}} incubates, but both sexes {{participate}} in the nest-building and feeding of <b>the</b> <b>chicks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chicks</b> are fed almost exclusively with insects.|$|R
50|$|Cave swallow chicks begin giving faint calls {{shortly after}} hatching. As <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> develop their calls become louder and more aggressive. These calls allow <b>the</b> <b>chicks</b> to {{communicate}} to the attending parent(s) their basic needs, such as hunger.|$|R
