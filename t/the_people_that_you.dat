500|$|Two remixes of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] are {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The first, by the Super Furry Animals themselves, is 3 minutes 23 seconds in length and largely follows {{the arrangement of the}} original with lengthy instrumental passages between each verse and chorus. Electronic drums and keyboards play alongside Gruff Rhys's vocals with barely any recognisable instrumentation from the version of the track which appears on Rings Around the World. The second remix by Lesser is 3 minutes 22 seconds long and begins with a short sample of Rhys singing the words [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> hate" [...] before breaking down to finger clicking and clapping. Rhys's vocals enter again, singing the title phrase, before samples of the original's string section and drums enter at 1 minute 11 seconds. The rest of the track continues with Rhys's vocals backed by disjointed drum and string samples, breaking down towards the end to just the lead vocals and a harp. The remix ends with Rhys singing the line [...] "Til someone stole my name" [...] a cappella.|$|E

60|$|The division, I repeat, {{between the}} Liberals and the Conservatives, is intense. Yet you might live {{for a long}} while in the town, between elections, and never know it. It is only when you get to {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> begin to see that there is a cross division running through them that nothing can ever remove. You gradually become aware of fine subtle distinctions that miss your observation at first. Outwardly, they are all friendly enough. For instance, Joe Milligan the dentist is a Conservative, and has been for six years, and yet he shares the same boat-house with young Dr. Gallagher, who is a Liberal, and they even bought a motor boat between them. Pete Glover and Alf McNichol were in partnership in the hardware and paint store, though they belonged on different sides.|$|E

60|$|Jesus Christ put a {{difference}} betwixt {{the form and}} spirit that is in prayer, and intimates the soul of prayer is in the desires of a man; 'Therefore,' saith he, 'I say unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them' (Mark 11:24). If a man prays never so long, and has never so many brave expressions in prayer, yet God counts it prayer no further than there are warm and fervent desires in it, after those things the mouth maketh mention of. David saith, 'Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee' (Psa 38:9). Can you say you desire, when you pray? or that your prayers come from the braying, panting, and longing of your hearts? If not, they shall not be granted: for God looks, when men are at prayer, to see if their heart and spirit is in their prayers; for he counts all other but vain speaking. Ye shall seek me, and find me, says he, when you shall search for me with all your heart (Rom 8:26,27; Matt 6:7; Jer 29:12). <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> read of in 2 Chronicles 15 are there said {{to do what they}} did 'with all their heart, and with all their soul.' 'For they sought God with their whole desire' (2 Chron 15:11-15). When a man's desires put him upon prayer, run along with him in his prayer, break out of his heart and ascend up to heaven with his prayers, it is a good sign that he is a righteous man, and that his desire shall be granted.|$|E

5000|$|Describing {{the track}} as [...] "fast, short and simple", Sykes has {{suggested}} that the line [...] "So you can throw me to the wolves/Tomorrow I will come back leader of the whole pack" [...] summarises the themes of the song, which include the proposition <b>that</b> [...] "it's <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> break <b>you</b> <b>that</b> also make you".

5000|$|Directed by Steve Perry and Jesse Locke, {{the video}} humorously depicts Perry as himself, intently {{composing}} and singing {{along to the}} song while his frustrated wife - played by his real-life wife Yvette - stands to the sidelines. Perry credited {{the concept of the}} video to Yvette Perry, examining the song through another angle in how the dedication to the life of an artist affects his or her family. [...] "Being a writer is a solitary job that never ends and steals away time from <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love", Perry wrote in a blog post, [...] "It's a Sisyphean struggle often with more downs than ups.
