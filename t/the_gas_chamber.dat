5|$|Ultimately, three SS {{guards were}} killed — {{one of whom}} was burned alive by the prisoners in the oven of Crematorium II — and 451 Sonderkommandos were killed. Hundreds of prisoners escaped, but were all soon {{captured}} and executed, along with an additional group who participated in the revolt. Crematorium IV was destroyed in the fighting, and a group of prisoners in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> of Crematorium V was spared in the chaos.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber.</b> The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E

5000|$|Defenders of Mayer {{argue that}} his {{statement}} that [...] "Sources {{for the study}} of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are at once rare and unreliable" [...] has been taken out of context, particularly by Holocaust deniers. Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> in <b>the</b> death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are [...] "rare" [...] and [...] "unreliable".|$|R
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5000|$|Holocaust deniers {{have often}} quoted {{out of context}} Mayer's {{sentences}} in the book: [...] "Sources {{for the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are at once rare and unreliable". As the authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have noted, the entire paragraph from which the sentence comes from states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> in <b>the</b> death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> are [...] "rare" [...] and [...] "unreliable".|$|R
50|$|In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Forensic Institute of Cracow, redid the analysis. Markiewicz {{decided that}} the Prussian blue test was {{unreliable}} because it depended on the acidity of the environment, which was low in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers,</b> from delousing chambers, and from living areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The negative control samples from the living quarters tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in both the delousing <b>chambers</b> and <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers.</b> <b>The</b> amount of cyanide found had a great variability, possibly due to 50 years {{of exposure to the}} elements to varying degrees, but even so, the categorical results were that cyanide was found where expected in both <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> and <b>the</b> delousing facilities, and not found in the living quarters, supporting the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> were exposed to high levels of cyanide like the delousing facilities, and not low levels for routine fumigation, like the living quarters.|$|R
5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each <b>gas</b> <b>chamber,</b> while <b>the</b> bulk of the work {{was done by the}} mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.|$|R
5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E
25|$|Most gas {{chambers}} were dismantled {{or destroyed}} as the Soviet troops approached, {{except for those}} at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> at Auschwitz I was amongst those blown up. It was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial, albeit with the entry door and the wall that originally separated <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chamber</b> from a washroom removed.

5|$|Mengele {{and other}} SS doctors did not treat inmates, but {{supervised}} {{the activities of}} inmate doctors forced {{to work in the}} camp medical service. Mengele made weekly visits to the hospital barracks and sent to <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> any prisoners who had not recovered after two weeks in bed. He was {{also a member of the}} team of doctors responsible for supervising the administration of Zyklon B, the cyanide-based pesticide that was used to kill people in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>chambers</b> at Birkenau.
