40|$|Reconstruction of the {{mandible}} after ablative surgery can {{be achieved}} by using preformed <b>trays</b> or <b>trays</b> <b>formed</b> from models produced by computer-assisted modelling systems. The former presents difficulty in matching the required facial contour, jaw relationship and condylar position; while the latter is expensive. This paper presents a simple and inexpensive method of fabricating a custom-made titanium bone grafting tray. The dimensions of the patient's mandible are obtained by clinical measurement. Such measurements are used to construct a mandibular replica. The region to be reconstructed is carved to produce the ideal shape and dimensions of an edentulous segment. The tray is made either by casting or by swaging. Twenty-one custom-made titanium bone grafting trays have been fitted in patients with encouraging results. This method of bone grafting tray construction is a simple, inexpensive technique for achieving excellent facial contour and functional reconstruction after mandibulectomy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|Kiso {{was born}} in Niitsu, Niigata, into the Katsura family that long had ties to Japan's {{imperial}} family. Her father, {{who had been a}} part of the government there, owned large tracts of land noted for their rice production. Kiso learned all of the traditional feminine arts of the upper class, such as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, and others, but she excelled especially in bonseki. Bonseki is the ancient art of arranging pure white sand and small white rocks on a black lacquer <b>tray,</b> thus <b>forming</b> miniature landscapes and seascapes. The sand and rocks were carefully manipulated with feathers, small brushes, and spoons. Each scene was temporary, only for the moment. The sand and rocks would then be brushed together and returned to their small storage containers to be used again. In addition, Kiso learned a technique for mixing glue with the sand so that the miniature scene would adhere to paper, and thus have a more permanent form. About 1950 in Tokyo, Kiso helped initiate an association for the cultivation and perpetuation of bonseki art.|$|R

40|$|The gypsum trays in Torgac Cave, New Mexico {{are only}} the second {{reported}} occurrence of this speleothem type in the world. They differ from most other (carbonate or gypsum) trays in that they often have stalactites growing on their flat undersides (thereby forming “claw ” shapes), and in that they can exhibit multiple tray growth in the vertical direction on a single stalactite. This deviation from “normal” tray development indicates that for gypsum <b>trays</b> to <b>form,</b> equilibrium must be reached between infiltra-tion and evaporation of water. If infiltration exceeds evaporation, then gypsum stalactites (“claws”) will form; if evaporation exceeds infiltration, then trays (with flat-bottomed surfaces) will form. Drier cli-matic conditions during the Holocene (last 10, 000 years) may have influenced the growth of gypsum trays in Torgac Cave.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) {{began an}} {{initiative}} {{to develop a}} microsatellite bus for generic application {{with the release of}} an RFP in August 2004. Phase A for this program is now completed and demonstrates, a multimission adaptable satellite bus that will be capable of satisfying at least three particular missions. The Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat), a joint CSA-DRDC (Defense Research and Development Canada) program, is scheduled as the first mission to be launched nominally {{in the first quarter of}} 2008. The second mission is nominally expected to launch two years later, in 2010, and will contain a radar altimeter payload whose objective is to measure the height of waves in the oceans.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{investigated}} the formation of 10 - 50 mm long “ice spikes ” that sometimes appear on the free surface of water when it solidifies. By freezing water under different conditions, we measured the probability of ice spike formation as a function of: 1) the air temperature in the freezing chamber, 2) air motion in the freezing chamber (which promotes evaporative cooling), 3) the quantity of dissolved salts in the water, and 4) the size, shape, and composing material of the freezing vessel. We found that the probability of ice spike formation is greatest when the air temperature is near- 7 C, the water is pure, and {{the air in the}} freezing chamber is moving. Even small quantities of dissolved solids greatly reduce the probability of ice spike formation. Under optimal conditions, approximately half the ice cubes in an ordinary ice cube <b>tray</b> will <b>form</b> ice spikes. Guided by these observations, we have examined the Bally-Dorsey model for the formation of ice spikes. In this model, the density change during solidification forces supercooled water up through a hollow ice tube, where it freezes around the rim to lengthen the tube. We propose that any dissolved solids in the water will tend to concentrate at the tip of a growing ice spike and inhibit its growth. This can qualitatively explain the observation that ice spikes do not readily form using water containing even small quantities of dissolved solids. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the possibility to add a barrier layer in the press forming phase of paperboard trays by sealing a polymer film to a paperboard substrate. Plastic coating is often an important part of packages manufactured for food packaging. Traditionally the paperboards for food packaging are coated in the paper mill before the actual forming of the package. Experiments with coated and uncoated boards were made and the bonding and adhesion of materials was observed. The results indicate that adhesion between the board and the film can be achieved in the forming process. However there are challenges, such as lack of adhesion, air bubble formation and deformation of formed products. It is still shown {{that it is possible to}} achieve a bond between the paperboard and a barrier film, and to subsequently add a barrier layer from a separate film to paperboard <b>trays</b> in the <b>forming</b> process...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{important}} potential for a development of a building system, if the present AACblock plants are completed with high performance concrete and pre-stressing technique. This can be done as a continuation of a present AAC production or in a site factory. Hybrid cooperation between AAC and concrete {{is not a new}} technology. Traditionally, AAC is covered with rendering. The wetted material is first sprayed with cement slurry after which comes lime/cement-based rendering which strengthens the wall and supplies a mechanical protection. AAC blocks can be used as infill members in concrete deck plates and concrete framed walls (Hellers, 1993), in which the shrinkage of the surrounding concrete locks completely the cured blocks into a stable composite. A good cooperation between AAC and concrete is a requirement for the pre-stressed hybrid. This combination has been investigated with reference to bond and moisture content. The interface must have sufficient bond to supply shear strength to the structural member. Also, the concrete should be suitable for pre-stressing which requires a minimum strength class K 40. Here, K 60 is applied in order to reduce creep and avoid creep failure of the AAC. A production layout for the purpose is suggested. This research consists of three parts: 1 - Hybrid concrete elements The principal formulation of hybrids, built on cooperation between two concrete materials, a weak AAC and a strong HPC poured on top, shows that this combination unites the most favourable qualities of the two concretes into a structural element with rational building technology. Load-bearing capacity is good, and the fire protection is excellent. Through pre-stressing of the structural concrete, a crack-free behaviour is guaranteed up to the service limit, and deflection from dead weight (incl. floor covering and possibly half the service load) be eliminated. The most important structural elements needed in a building system could be taken as hybrids. In drawings, different members like floor- roof- and wall members, window and door lintels are shown. 2 - Production system for hybrids AAC blocks form a bed containing the pre-stressing steel in slits and on which high performance concrete is poured. Pre-stressing brings the two concretes together. This is especially important for the shear capacity of a building member, by which extra dowels can be omitted. The pre-stressing force is anchored by plates directly against the cured AAC blocks. A special pre-stressing bed is not required. The production is arranged {{in such a way that}} necessary equipment (<b>trays,</b> <b>form</b> strips, wedges, locks) are circulated within twenty-four hours. The necessary manpower for this facility is analysed. Normally 8 men are needed per shift. A detailed conceptual production layout for a hybrid production plant is included for discussion. See figure 6. 2 (suggested production layout). 3 - Application in building The hybrid members are united at joints and through seams. Continuity over connections is achieved by filling seams with mortar grout. Reinforcement may be included to achieve ductility. By a similar method, it is possible to make connections between horizontal and vertical building members. Common connection details are shown in the report. This building method replaces the equivalent method with concrete or AAC members, and it is in fact a coordination between these two. The maximum span of floor members is up to 9 m. It makes the system suitable for modern residential house production, but also suitable for office buildings, industrial halls and other applications. See attached drawings, part 2 and part 3.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{has long}} been recognised as a useful tool in improved process operation and design studies. Commercial simulation packages now available for batch distillation studies typically assume constant tray efficiency. Here, {{on the basis of}} both practical work and computer simulation, the effects of tray efficiency variation with tray liquid composition on model accuracy and column performance are investigated. Detailed modelling studies were carried out on a pilot batch distillation unit and tray efficiency was found to be an important factor affecting the model fidelity. Distillation of different methanol/water mixtures revealed that tray efficiency varies with the mixture composition on the <b>tray,</b> the <b>form</b> of the variation being for the efficiency to pass through a minimum at intermediate compositions. This variation of tray efficiency with tray composition is a known phenomenon, which has not been included in batch distillation simulations even though tray compositions change significantly during a batch run. The model developed in this work (Variable Efficiency Model) includes the tray efficiency variation with mixture composition and results in an evident improvement in model accuracy for methanol/water distillation. The potential effects of strong tray efficiency dependence on mixture composition, at a more general level, are investigated using two case studies, based on hypothetical extensions of the tray efficiency concentration dependence observed for methanol/water mixtures. In extreme cases, the efficiency-composition dependence could introduce a significant additional non-linearity to the process behaviour, resulting in unexpected composition and temperature movements. To quantify the potential significance of these effects, the economic performance of a column based on simulation using the Variable Efficiency Model was compared with its performance, using an overall column efficiency (which is the common practice). Using fixed column efficiency was found to under-predict column performance for low purity products and over-predict performance for high purity products...|$|R

After 30 days from transplanting plants were harvested for determining the weight of fresh and dry shoot, stem diameter, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and content of macro and micronutrients. Organic compost addition did not influence arbuscular mycorrhizal activity and also increased shoot dry weight.

40|$|Press forming is {{nowadays}} one of {{the most}} common industrial methods in use for producing deeper trays from paperboard. Demands for material properties like recyclability and sustainability have increased also in the packaging industry, but there are still limitations related to the formability of paperboard. A majority of recent studies have focused on material development, but the potential of the package manufacturing process can also be improved by the development of tooling and process control. In this study, advanced converting tools (die cutting tools and the press forming mould) are created for production scale paperboard tray manufacturing. Also monitoring methods that enable the production of paperboard trays with enhanced quality, and can be utilized in process control are developed. The principles for tray blank preparation, including creasing pattern and die cutting tool design are introduced. The mould heating arrangement and determination of mould clearance are investigated to improve the quality of the press <b>formed</b> <b>trays.</b> The effect of the spring back of the tray walls on the tray dimensions can be managed by adjusting the heat-related process parameters and estimating it at the mould design stage. This enables production speed optimization as the process parameters can be adjusted more freely. Real-time monitoring of pressing force by using multiple force sensors embedded in the mould structure can be utilized in the evaluation of material characteristics on a modified production machinery. Comprehensive process control can be achieved with a combination of measurement of the outer dimensions of the trays and pressing force monitoring. The control method enables detection of defects and tracking changes in the material properties. The optimized converting tools provide a basis for effective operation of the control system...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of lidding films to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based lidding film. One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the <b>formed</b> <b>trays</b> to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer lidding films can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R
