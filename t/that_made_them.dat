5|$|Formed by Sumner and Hook {{after the}} two {{attended}} a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division soon moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> {{one of the pioneers}} of the late-1970s post-punk movement. The band's self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E

5|$|Tripathi had {{initially}} {{decided to write}} a book on the philosophy of evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he decided {{to write a book}} on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download, to entice readers.|$|E
5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political purpose <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> worth their colossal expense. She {{presided over the}} royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by religious civil war, Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E
5000|$|Rav and Samuel {{differed}} in {{their interpretation of}} the report in [...] that [...] "because the midwives feared God," [...] God [...] "made them houses." [...] One said <b>that</b> God <b>made</b> <b>them</b> the ancestors of the priestly and Levitical houses, as Aaron and Moses were children of Jochebed. And the other said <b>that</b> God <b>made</b> <b>them</b> the ancestors of the royal house of Israel, teaching that Caleb married Miriam, whom 1 Chronicles [...] calls Ephrath, and [...] reports that David {{was the son of}} an Ephrathite.|$|R

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E

The engine and transmission in no. 456 had to be replaced, {{and there was an}} ongoing problem with the fuel supply <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> unsuitable for use on the hills. Also, the rear-engine nature of this vehicle caused problems with weight distribution, which was resolved by changing the seating configuration to 35 seated, 34 standing.|$|E

25|$|The Formidables and Londons had an {{improved}} hull form <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> handier {{at high speeds}} than the Majestics.

25|$|The National Chinese {{authorities}} ridiculed Japanese {{estimates of}} Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald {{stated that the}} Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true amount of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> appear lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the opposing groups, historians have assessed {{evidence of their}} hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian Leonard Woods Labaree identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots. Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side.|$|E

Released fonts include Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Impact, Georgia, Trebuchet, Webdings and Verdana—under an EULA <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> freely distributable but also limited some usage rights. Their high penetration rate has made them a staple for Web designers. However, most Linux distributions don't include these fonts by default.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, the U.S. {{announced}} $145.4 {{million in}} proposed aid for anti-terror efforts in {{north and east}} Africa, including four Raven systems {{to be used by}} forces from Uganda and Burundi as part of the ongoing African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The US has also announced its intent to supply an unspecified number of Ravens to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukrainian operators criticized the Raven's analog control system <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> vulnerable to jamming and hacking by sophisticated Russian-backed separatists.|$|E
25|$|While Modern Life Is Rubbish was a {{moderate}} success, it was Blur's third album Parklife <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> {{arguably the most}} popular band in the UK in 1994. Parklife continued the fiercely British nature of its predecessor, and coupled {{with the death of}} Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in April of that year it seemed that British alternative rock had finally turned back the tide of grunge dominance. That same year Oasis released their debut album Definitely Maybe, which broke Suede's record for fastest-selling debut album.|$|E

25|$|In 1844 Poland, {{the term}} intelligencja, {{identifying}} the intellectuals of society, first {{was used by}} the philosopher Karol Libelt, which he described as a status class of people characterised by intellect and Polish nationalism; qualities of mind, character, and spirit <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> natural leaders of the modern Polish nation. That the intelligentsia were aware of their social status and of their duties to society: Educating the youth with the nationalist objective to restore the Republic of Poland; preserving the Polish language; and love of the Fatherland.|$|E
25|$|Often, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with {{variations}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> {{more compelling}} to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and {{capabilities of the}} trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created {{the role of the}} jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.|$|E
25|$|The Siberian Traps had unusual {{features}} <b>that</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> {{even more}} dangerous. Pure flood basalts produce fluid, low-viscosity lava {{and do not}} hurl debris into the atmosphere. It appears, however, that 20% of {{the output of the}} Siberian Traps eruptions was pyroclastic (consisted of ash and other debris thrown high into the atmosphere), increasing the short-term cooling effect. The basalt lava erupted or intruded into carbonate rocks and into sediments that {{were in the process of}} forming large coal beds, both of which would have emitted large amounts of carbon dioxide, leading to stronger global warming after the dust and aerosols settled.|$|E
