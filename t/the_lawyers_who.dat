5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 23 November 2007, within a span of 25 minutes, six consecutive serial blasts occurred in the Lucknow, Varanasi, and Faizabad courts, in which 28 {{people were killed and}} several others injured. The blasts came a week after the Uttar Pradesh police and central security agencies busted Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists who had planned to abduct Rahul Gandhi. The Indian Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for these blasts in an email sent to TV stations five minutes before the blast. The first blast occurred in the premises of the Varanasi civil court and collectorate between 13:05 and 13:07. Two successive blasts occurred in the Faizabad district court around 13:12 and 13:15, closely followed by one at Lucknow at 13:32. Bombs were explicitly targeted at <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> were working in the courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from <b>the</b> <b>lawyers,</b> <b>who</b> opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no {{evidence}} of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change {{things in the world}} that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> worked {{to keep them out of}} jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, [...] the CCAF won a case at {{a federal}} appeals court in California in which they objected to class action {{settlements}} and attorneys' fees in litigation regarding Bluetooth headsets. The original case over the headsets had been filed when lawyers had noticed news articles about potential hearing loss and headsets and filed suits on behalf of millions of Motorola and Plantronics customers. The prior settlement would have effectively paid consumers nothing but given <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> negotiated the pact $850,000 in fees, amended by Frank and his firm. Frank regards the case as a milestone in his fight to prevent abuses. Frank also unsuccessfully filed an objection to a settlement in an antitrust case against Sirius XM Radio, which provided nothing for the plaintiffs, but a 100 percent payout of $13 million for the attorneys. Judge Harold Baer, Jr. ruled on 24 August that the settlement terms [...] "demonstrate sufficient fairness, adequacy and reasonableness" [...] and rejected Frank's claims. Frank vowed to appeal, saying [...] "you don't like to lose, but it's a good case to take to the appellate court." [...] In June 2010, the CCAF filed an objection on behalf of four class members to the Dewey v. Volkswagen, Water Ingress Settlement where attorneys were asking for over $23 million for recovering an $8 million reimbursement fund for a small subset of the class. The case is still pending.|$|E
2500|$|The DoD had {{initially}} {{told the press}} {{that none of the}} three men who killed themselves had legal representation, or had filed habeas applications. Jeff Davis, one of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> volunteered to be part of Al Utaybi's legal team, disputed this, saying that their efforts to represent the detainee had been [...] "thwarted at every turn" [...] by the DOD.|$|E
2500|$|Emory {{was offered}} the Democratic {{nomination}} for Judge of the Supreme Court in 1917.

It was at that time that he had applied for acceptance to the first Officer's Camp at Fort Myer, Virginia, in order to participate in the training that would take him to a position of leadership in the US Army.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of three detainees, camp {{authorities}} seized prisoners' papers. Described as a security measure, it was claimed that instructions for tying a hangman's noose had been found written on stationery issued to <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> met with detainees to discuss their habeas corpus requests. The Department of Justice acknowledged in court that [...] "privileged attorney-client communications" [...] had been seized. Hicks's lawyer questioned whether Hicks could {{have been part of}} a suicide plot, since he had spent the preceding four months in solitary confinement in {{a different part of the}} camp, and expressed concern that attorney-client confidentiality, [...] "the last legal right that was being respected", had been violated.|$|E
2500|$|Sue Himmelrich, one of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> {{represented}} Cox in Los Angeles, {{called the}} judge's dismissal of Erhard's libel claim a victory: [...] "We {{think this is}} a tremendous victory. Half of the lawsuit has been knocked out without the judge even having heard evidence, which is obviously unusual," [...] she said. She said that Cox was [...] "absolutely thrilled" [...] when he heard of the judge's decision to throw out the libel charge. She said that [...] "we have no doubt we'll win" [...] the on the slander claim, as well as a possible appeal by Erhard of the dismissal of the libel claim. Himmelrich characterized Erhard's legal complaint as [...] "a nuisance suit".|$|E
2500|$|In {{testimony}} before the Civil Rights Commission, Adams stated [...] "I was told by voting section management that cases {{are not going to}} be brought against black defendants on [...] of white victims." [...] Adams accused <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> ordered the narrowing of the case of having not read the documents describing the facts and applicable law before making this decision, and claimed that his superiors had instructed him and others in the voting section to no longer bring any cases against minority offenders. Adams said, responding to the claim that the New Black Panthers' actions in Philadelphia were an [...] "isolated incident":To the contrary, the Black Panthers in October 2008 announced a nationwide deployment for the election. We had indications that polling-place thugs were deployed elsewhere, not only in November 2008, but during the Democratic primaries, where they targeted white Hillary Rodham Clinton supporters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Tigar, her attorney, {{stated that}} [...] "this case {{really is a}} threat to all <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> are out there {{attempting}} to represent people that face these terrible consequences." [...] Supporters of Stewart alleged that the government charged her for her speech in defending the rights of her client. They believed that Stewart's efforts to release communications from her client were part of an appropriate defense method to gain public awareness and support. They also expressed alarm that wiretaps and hidden cameras authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were used by the government to gather evidence against her, which they called a violation of attorney–client privilege. George Soros' Open Society Institute also donated $20,000 to Stewart's legal defense fund in 2002. Commenting on her case, human rights organization Front Line states that it [...] "has had a chilling effect on human rights defenders who stand between government agencies and potential victims of abuses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regional media {{immediately}} {{picked up}} the lawsuit, {{and members of the}} research team were shocked when they found out about it. All of the scientists named in the suit were adamant that they never coerced Genie, maintaining that Genie's mother and her lawyers grossly exaggerated the length and nature of their testing, and denied any breach of confidentiality. While David Rigler was giving his deposition he discovered that Jean Butler Ruch had goaded Genie's mother into suing, and in an interview several years later <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> <b>who</b> worked with Genie's mother confirmed Ruch heavily influenced the actions of Genie's mother throughout the course of the lawsuit. According to author Russ Rymer, the suit was settled in 1984. However, in 1993 David Rigler wrote, [...] "he case never came to trial. It was dismissed by the Superior Court of the State of California 'with prejudice,' meaning that because it was without substance it can never again be refiled." ...|$|E
