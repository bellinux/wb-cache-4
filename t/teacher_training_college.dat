40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this study, conducted in Kabul province, {{is to find out}} important differences and similarities between public and private <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> that are operating in 2014 and to find out implications such variations might have for quality of teacher education. Secondary objectives of this study are: a) to explore possible associations between demographic and socio-economic characteristics of student-teachers and the type of <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> and b) to explore possible association between motivations behind studying in <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> and the type of <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> This study has targeted directors, lecturers and students from the <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Questionnaires were prepared including items concerning demographic and socio-economic information and thereafter distributed to all three groups. Furthermore, the participants responded about the motivations for students and teachers to enroll in the <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> The study will also investigate if eventual differences existed in the enrolment procedures of the students and the recruitment process of the teachers between public and private <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Based on Ministry of Education’s policy implementation this study found more similarities than differences between public and private <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges.</b> Differences included enrolment of students through advertisement by the private <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> while public <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> enrolled students through the university-admission test called kankor. The recruitment process of teachers’ was the same, at both public and Private <b>Teacher</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Colleges</b> –in which recruited teachers should have minimum 75 % average marks at university.
