2500|$|Dumézil {{maintains}} that Jupiter is not himself a god {{of war and}} agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view {{is based on the}} methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god Varuna) and lawful right (by the Vedic god Mitra). However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour).|$|E

Contractors indicate that certain functions including procurement practices. cost control. scheduling and management integration need much improvement. Whereas the consultants indicate that they are concerned about design standards. design practices. drafting and specifications. From the research it was found that funding by the government appears to be necessary to support construction productivity programmes. It is recommended that designers awareness of materials and equipment issues could improve construction productivity. Also it is recommended surveys to be conducted every 3 - 4 years to observe and identify new trends in the industry and to direct research in the appropriate direction...|$|R

Marshall focuses specifically on fiction, identifying it as the writing genre {{most likely to be}} picked up by a publisher. Drawing from Dwight V.

Marshall recommends the number, and <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and reaction sections in relation to a novel's length. He also recommends the corresponding story arc with plot points all in a specific order, the number and type of viewpoint characters, the type of opposition, and other elements of plot and character development.|$|E
