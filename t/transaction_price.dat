In comparison, KBB notes, the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46% after 36 months. KBB's estimate assumed gasoline price will be around [...] per gallon in 2014. For 2012, Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42% of its original value after 3 years and 27% after 5 years. Based on these figures, in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the plug-in electric car category. KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35.5% average due to the [...] federal tax credit, which lowers the <b>transaction</b> <b>price</b> and pushes down the residual value.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} further the way information disseminates from informed to uninformed traders {{in a market}} populated by heterogeneous boundedly rational agents. In order to achieve the goal, a computer simulated market where {{only a small fraction}} of the population observe the risky asset's fundamental value with noise was constructed, while the rest of agents try to forecast the asset's <b>price</b> from past <b>transaction</b> data. The paper departs from previous studies in that the risky asset does not pay a dividend every period, so agents cannot learn from past <b>transaction</b> <b>prices</b> and subsequent dividend payments. The main finding is that information can potentially disseminate in the market as long as: (1) informed investors' trades tilt <b>transaction</b> <b>prices</b> in the fundamental path direction; and (2) the median investor's expectation is very responsive to <b>transaction</b> <b>prices.</b> Otherwise, markets may display crashes or bubbles.
