It considers how the control performance of a pelagic trawl system can be improved, partly by introducing a control architecture tailor-made for the trawl system subject to industrial requirements, and partly by developing a <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control concept. A mathematical model of the trawl system is developed, including an accurate model of the hydrodynamic forces on the trawl doors. This model estimates both the steady state and the transient forces on trawl doors moving in six degrees of freedom. The steady state hydrodynamic forces are based on wind tunnel experiments. To estimate the transient forces, a software code based on potential theory is developed. This software estimates the time-dependency of the forces from circulation about the foil, the angular damping forces, and the forces from relative accelerations between the fluid and the <b>trawl</b> <b>door.</b> Various concepts for <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control are evaluated. This is done both analytically, by simulations and by towing tank experiments. Based on the results, a new <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control concept is proposed. The <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control concept is developed to fulfill the demands on both energy consumption, robustness and control performance. Because of the contradictory demands on performance, stability and energy efficiency, the control concept is improved using numerical optimization. The optimization is based on timedomain simulations of the trawl system. The design of an overall trawl control architecture {{taking advantage of the}} <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control system is presented. This takes industrial constraints into account, such as the energy supply on the trawl doors. The control system is based on model predictive control and facilitates complex objectives, constraints and process models. The use of model predictive control is made possible by letting PID plant controllers act as a layer between the model predictive controller and the trawl system. The model predictive controller is thus able to operate on a stable and predictable system with no fast dynamics. To reduce the energy consumption of the <b>trawl</b> <b>door,</b> conventional feedback control is avoided on this part of the control system, and step wise feedforward control is instead employed. The main contributions in this work are the mathematical modeling of the hydrodynamic forces on a <b>trawl</b> <b>door,</b> the design of a control architecture tailor-made for trawl system control and the method for optimization of the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> control concept. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{fuel prices}} have been {{inflating}} the operating costs of the fishing industry. Trawl doors are used to hold the fishing net open during trawling operations, {{and they have a}} great influence on the fuel consumption of vessels. Improvements in the design of trawl doors could therefore contribute significantly to increased fuel efficiency. An efficient optimization algorithm using two- and three-dimensional (2 D and 3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models is presented. Accurate CFD models, especially 3 D, are computationally expensive. The direct use of traditional optimization algorithms, which often require a large number of evaluations, can therefore be prohibitive. The proposed method is iterative and uses low-order local response surface approximation models as surrogates for the expensive CFD model {{to reduce the number of}} iterations. The algorithm is applied to the design of two types of geometries: a typical modern <b>trawl</b> <b>door,</b> and a novel airfoil-shaped <b>trawl</b> <b>door.</b> The results from the 2 D design optimization show that the hydrodynamic efficiency of the typical modern <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> could be increased by 32 %, and the novel airfoil-shaped <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> by 13 %. When the 2 D optimum designs for the two geometries are compared, the novel airfoil-shaped <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> results to be 320 % more efficient than the optimized design of the typical modern <b>trawl</b> <b>door.</b> The 2 D optimum designs were used as the initial designs for the 3 D design optimization. The results from the 3 D optimization show that the hydrodynamic efficiency could be increased by 6 % for both the typical modern and novel airfoil-shaped trawl doors. Results from a 3 D CFD analysis show that 3 D flow effects are significant, where the values for drag are significantly underestimated in 2 D CFD models...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{variation in}} trawl dimension, bottom contact, and catch with differing warp lengths during walleye pollock surveys {{conducted by the}} Fisheries Research Agency. The ratio of warp length to fishing depth (scope ratio) was set at 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 5 at depths of 110 m. At a 2. 5 scope ratio, the net mouth shape and footgear contact fluctuated, as the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> did not contact the bottom. Footgear contact was complete when the scope ratio was 3. 0 or more. Walleye pollock, sculpins, and flatfishes were the main catch in all tows, and the catch increased with scope ratio.

However, the length frequency at 3. 5 was significantly different from that of other scope ratios. These results suggest the following: at a scope ratio of 3. 0 or more, the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> will not leave the bottom at any depths. To compliment echo surveys for walleye pollock, a 3. 0 scope ratio would be optimal, since the catch data for a 3. 5 scope ratio was dissimilar from that of scope ratios...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, new {{knowledge}} on semi-pelagic trawling {{has been created}} in MultiSEPT project. The achievements in the project have been possible because of extensive cooperation between the scientific and industrial partners. This report briefly describes the activities {{carried out in the}} MultiSEPT project in 2013. Full scale tests of the semi circular spreading gear (SCSG) showed that this ground gear was easy to rig and operate, its geometry was stable during towing and it had good bottom contact. The spreading (distance between wing-ends) was approximately 7 % higher with the SCSG than with the rockhopper gear for the same gear and door spreading. The SCSG had good bottom contact and passed bottom obstacles (e. g. stones) easily. The size distribution of fish caught with the SCSG was very similar to that caught with the rockhopper. However, the number of hauls performed with the SCSG and with the rockhopper was too small to draw a clear conclusion on catch efficiency. The SCSG is a gear that is easy to rig and handle on deck, it does not require accurate adjustments, it has few control points and low weight, and the results indicate that its performance at sea is at least comparable to the rockhopper gear for given bottom conditions. Further development of the SCSG should emphasise on improving the construction materials used today in oder to reduce the wearing and increase its lifetime. Two full scale tests were carried out in spring and autum 2013 to assess the effect of sweep length on herding of fish during semi-pelagic trawling for cod and haddock. The results showed that sweep length can {{have a significant effect on}} the catches. Fixing the 450 -kg chain weights right in front of the ground gear captured in up to 50 % less cod and up to 60 % haddock (of all sizes) than when the chain weights were fixed 45 m in front of the ground gear. These results demonstrate that at least under the conditions encountered in these trials, the sweeps have a major role on the fish herding process of the gear. The state estimator model (the core of of the Roll Royce Marine's e-Trawling system) was compared with data from small scale tests in SINTEF's test tank in Hirtshals, Denmark, carried out in July 2013. The results showed that the model apparently works well. The state estimator model is currently being validated against acoustic sensor data from full scale trials with semi-pelagic trawling carried out in November 2013. A concept for remote control of existing trawl doors, which is based on manipulating the moment Balance of the trawl doors, has been designed by SINTEF. This is achieved using control lines between points on the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> and external lines (warps or bridles). By tensioning such lines, the orientation of the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> is controlled, which again is used to control the hydrodynamic forces created by the <b>trawl</b> <b>door.</b> The energy consumption of this concept is greatly reduced by changing the rigging of the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> to reduce its stability. A pair of 0. 6 m 2 Injector XF 9 semi-pelagic doors are currently being instrumeted with actuator and will be tested in Hirtshals' flume tank in early 2014. Semi-pelagic shrimp trawling showed approx. 6 - 8 % lower fuel consumption than bottom shrimp trawling. The 2. 5 m 2 semi-pelagic doors tested during our trials were overdimensioned for the coastal trawler "Gullholmen", and they had to be set at the lowest angle of attack to reduce spreading force and match that of the bottom trawl doors normally used by the vessel. A set of smaller doors (approx. 2 m 2) would had been a better choice to achieve the spreading force necessary for a 1500 # shrimp trawl. This would have reduced the fuel consumption even more. Shrimp catches were too low (15 – 45 kg/hour) and very variable from haul to haul to draw any conclusion on the fishing efficiency of the gear with the different sets of doors. Further experiments with coastal shrimp trawlers are planned for winter 2014...|$|E
40|$|The Santa Maria di Leuca (SML) cold-water coral (CWC) {{province}} is {{a proposed}} priority conservation area {{according to several}} conservation initiatives in the Mediterranean Sea. Part {{of it is a}} Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA). Anthropogenic impacts due to fishing on this FRA were investigated using a towed camera system during 2005. The geographic distribution of fishing effort in the SML CWC province was exam- ined through an observers’ program of longline and trawl fishing activities during 2009 and 2010 and Vessel Monitoring by satellite System (VMS) data from 2008 to 2013. Using the video system, it was possible to observe evidence of impacts in the FRA due to longlines, proved by remains of lines on the bottoms and/or entangled in corals, and those due to trawl nets, proved by <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> scars on the bottom. The application of Generalized Liner Models indicates that the impacts due to longline were significantly related to a geographic site characterized by carbonate mounds while those from trawl net were significantly related to the soft bottoms, consisting of bioturbated fine-grained sediments. The presence of waste of various types was also observed in the FRA; plastic was the most widespread waste and was significantly related to a macrohabitat characterized by the presence of corals. The geographic distribution of fishing effort for each type of fishing were rather superimposed in the two years of the observers' program and six years of VMS data with a significantly greater fishing effort outside the FRA than inside this area. The trawlers generally fished on the muddy bottoms of the upper and middle slope within the SML CWC province and near and inside the northward limit of the FRA.

40|$|Trawling {{involves}} the towing of nets {{through the water}} or along the seafloor to sieve out fish and marine invertebrates. It is {{the most widely used}} method to catch fish throughout the world, and there are many variations in gear design and towing methods. The main type of trawl used on seamounts is termed a bottom trawl. This equipment is towed off two wires from the stern of the fishing vessel, with the net spread in between and held apart by steel <b>trawl</b> <b>doors.</b> These doors drag along the seafloor, throwing up two sediment plumes, which helps herd fish into the net, where they are swept back into the closed cod-end of the trawl. The bottom part of the net may have large rollers (Figure 1 b) to avoid snagging on rocks, which can cause serious damage to the net. Bottom trawls used on flat ground (e. g., ocean floor covered by pelagic sediment) can be large, but on seamounts they are often smaller and more heavily built because they are being towed over rocky and rough seabed. Although seamount trawls are smaller, the intensity of trawling can be extremely high, with hundreds, or even thousands, of trawls carried out on individual seamounts (Clark and Koslow, 2007). Trawling occurs from the summit down the flanks, often repeatedly along the same tow lines. The distance between the <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> is usually about 100 m, and between the ends of the net about 25 m. <b>Trawl</b> <b>doors</b> may weigh up to 2 t each, and the net and ground gear between 3 and 4 t...|$|R

40|$|Otter {{trawling}} {{has been}} the prevalent method of ground fishing in Atlantic Canada. Despite this, {{little is known about}} associated impacts to benthic habitat and communities. This thesis examines the impacts of otter trawling on bivalves living in sand, a bottom type occurring widely over the Grand Banks. Bivalves are dominant members of sandy bottoms on continental shelves and are good indicators of physical disturbance. Two broad categories of impacts to benthos from mobile fishing gear are direct harvest and incidental damage. Bivalves have low susceptibility to capture by groundfish otter trawls; trawl capture efficiency is on the order of 10 ⁻⁵. In order to investigate incidental impacts, a three-year otter trawling experiment was conducted on a fine to medium sand bottom on the northeastern Grand Bank. Each year a total of 12 trawl passes were made along the centre line of two 13 km by 200 m experimental corridors. Sampling was conducted inside experimental and adjacent reference corridors with a 0. 5 m² hydraulic grab. No significant effects of trawling were detected on bivalve populations in any year. Shallow burrowing species showed no significant changes in density or biomass and recruitment of juveniles ≤ 3 mm was apparent inside trawled corridors. The size structure of populations from trawled and reference areas were similar. Mean (± sd) percent major shell damage immediately after trawling was low, ranging from 2. 8 ± 6. 1 % to 13. 5 + 9. 4 %. Trawl doors are the most destructive gear component of otter trawls. A physical <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> model was towed through an artificial sand testbed, constructed to resemble an offshore seabed. Although bivalves within the scour path were displaced, levels of damage were low (c. 5 %), similar to levels of damage from the combined effects of all gear components recorded in the field experiment. The anomaly of displacement, accompanied by few instances of damage, is explained by sediment mechanics associated with scouring and size and life position of infaunal bivalves. Compared to natural sediment-mediated disturbances, otter trawling can be manipulated over a wide range of frequencies.

40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from Nephrops trawling in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of Øresund to towed gears since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of towed gears in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal towed gears in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod trawl fishery and Nephrops trawl fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of towed gears may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the <b>trawl</b> <b>door</b> distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the Nephrops trawl fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase – reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of semi-pelagic trawl doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of Rapa whelk and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of discarded catch in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|E

The study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with the doors and sweeps at the seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with the doors and sweeps at the seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with the doors and sweeps lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting the doors and sweeps from the seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting the doors and sweeps from the seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R

The fish starts diving about 15 min before vessel passing. This coincides with the time the trawl is running and not with the gradual increase in vessel noise caused by the approaching vessel. The change in horizontal movement is more gradual and is directed away from the vessel in the alongship direction, but towards the vessel in the athwarthship direction.

Since the development of scuba diving equipment and cheap video cameras it has been possible to directly observe the processes that occur when a trawl is towed along the seabed.The <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> disturb the sea bed, create a cloud of muddy water which hides the oncoming trawl net and generates a noise which attracts fish. The fish begin to swim {{in front of the}} net mouth. As the trawl continues along the seabed, fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net. Finally, the fish become exhausted and drop back, into the [...] "cod end" [...] and are caught.The speed that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species which is being targeted and the exact gear that is being used, but for most demersal species, a speed of around 4 knots (7 km/h) is appropriate.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Trawl cables are wire ropes which corrode {{under the}} {{influence}} of seawater depending on fishing habits. Information about the problem was obtained from the preceeding work by Robert D. Malloch, and from contacts with the fishermen. Statistical data about fishing boats and fishing habits on the Pacific Northwest Coast are drawn from the answers to a questionnaire sent to the fishermen in September, 1979. Trawl line corrosion is studied with at-dock tests on wire rope, and laboratory tests on single wire. A model of corrosion of galvanized trawl wire rope is derived from cathodic protection calculations and experimental results. This model describes the corrosion due to the influence of bare steel trawl docrs and uniform corrosion. The time needed to corrode the zinc coating {{is a function of the}} distance from bare steel <b>trawl</b> <b>doors.</b> Besides the physical constants of the wire rope and of the seawater, the most important parameter is the average electric conductance of the coating on the wire rope, this coating being either an oxide film or an organic coating. Practical methods of protection from corrosion of trawl wire rope are drawn from this study. They are simple enough to be applied by the fishermen themselves...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} documentation on {{the distribution}} of, and damages to, deep-water reefs of the coral Lophelia pertusa in Norwegian waters. The reef areas have traditionally been rich fishing grounds for long-line and gillnet fisheries, and the coral habitat is known to support a high diversity of benthic species. Anecdotal reports claim that trawlers often use the gear, wires, chains and <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> to crush the corals and clear the area before fishing starts. To get {{an overview of the}} situation, information about the distribution and damage were collected from the literature, fishermen, and our own investigations. The results show that the corals are abundant particularly on the mid Norwegian continental shelf between 200 and 400 m depth. In general it seems that the largest densities are distributed along the continental break and at ridges of morainic origin. The reports from fishermen suggested severe damage to the corals and in situ observations using ROV confirmed the presence of mechanically damaged corals located on trawling grounds. A first estimate of the fishery impact indicates that between 30 and 50 % of the reef areas are damaged or impacted. Fishermen claim that catches are significantly lowered in areas where the reefs are damaged. Potential ecological consequences of the destruction are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fishing power studies (calibration experiments) are {{necessary}} if significant changes {{are made to}} elements of the trawl survey system over the time series. Such {{studies have been conducted}} in the past for the NEFSC bottom trawl surveys when elements such as survey ships and <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> have been changed (Sissenwine and Bowman, 1978; Byrne and Forrester, 1991; Forrester unpublished ms). These studies rely on side-by-side or repeat towing, with tows taken by one vessel serving as control, and the element of change (e. g., doors or ships) as the primary factor under investigation. Other variables such as the order of tows in repeat towing or the orientation of side-by-side towing (port vs. starboard) are usually randomized. A one-time change in the trawl gear that affected the catching efficiency and, hence, the survey series was made in the 1980 s as the doors were upgraded from a BMV wood and metal door to an all-metal oval polyvalent door (Byrne and Forrester 1991). To appropriately adjust the time series, conversion factors were estimated from replicated towing experiments to maintain the integrity of the time series, as the new doors generally improved the catch efficiency of the survey tows. Similarly, while the Albatross IV has been the primary survey vessel used in the bottom trawl time series, because of various scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repai...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} and environmental concerns have led bottom trawlers fishing for cod (Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea to use semi-pelagic doors. However, this change may affect fish herding and consequently the catch {{efficiency of the}} gear. In this study we compared the catch efficiency of two different setups where the sweep length with bottom contact was different. This setup also enabled us to estimate the herding efficiency of the sweeps on the seabed. The {{data for this study}} were collected using the alternate haul method and analyzed using a new method for unpaired data. We estimated that the setup with the lifted sweeps captured on average 33 % fewer cod than the setup that kept the sweeps at the seabed. The loss of catch for cod was length independent and significant for a length span between 41 and 104 cm. When sweeps were lifted above the seabed, herding was negatively impacted and fish were lost; in contrast, when on the seabed, the sweeps were able to herd (on average) 45 % of the cod into the catch zone of the gear. Lifting the <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> from the seabed is touted as a positive development for this fishery. However, our results show that lifting the doors and consequently the sweeps can lead to substantial catch losses. Finally, the study highlights the importance of carefully evaluating the positive and negative potential consequences of introducing changes in a fishing gear...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} seabed {{pressure}} of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area {{and depth of}} seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed {{at the level of}} the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear “footprints”. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as <b>trawl</b> <b>doors,</b> sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size–gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by métier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~ 1. 6 km 2 h - 1 of which 0. 08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0. 19 km 2 h - 1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|The final {{research}} cruise {{described in}} this report had the objective to compare the physical and biological impact of the bottom trawl modifications developed during the EU DEGREE project to a standard bottom trawl used in the Barents Sea cod fisheries. The “new” trawl was fitted with the last modification of the plate gear developed during the project as well as <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> (standard Thyborøn doors) rigged to barely touch the bottom. The commercial trawl used for comparison was rigged with a conventional rockhopper ground gear and the doors were rigged to go heavy on the bottom as normally rigged during commercial bottom trawling. We looked for combinations enabling us to fish with the doors off, or nearly off, the bottom, while the ground gear was still on bottom and the door spread was maintained. This enabled almost no impact of the doors on the seabed while hopefully keeping an acceptable fishing efficiency for species not sensitive to herding effects of doors. More fishing experiments are therefore needed before it may be concluded that this rigging can be recommended for commercial use by the fishing fleet. The physical and biological impact on the bottom habitat of the two trawls was compared. Only two valid impact hauls was done with each trawl, both on very soft sediments. This is of course too few hauls to obtain a full statistical comparison between the two trawls. However, all parameters measured indicated that the plate gear trawl had a lower impact on the bottom substrate and benthic organisms than the conventional rockhopper trawl. The physical impact on the bottom was visually inspected and measured by ROV technique. Although the number of hauls was low, {{the results indicated that}} the rockhopper dug up more living material than the plate gear. This tendency was confirmed by the ROV investigations...|$|R

5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce frozen fillets at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{development}} in bottom trawling {{is the use}} of twin trawl equipment, where two trawl nets are towed side by side from a single vessel. This increases the catch rate and efficiently of the trawler. Governed by cost and catch optimization, the use of twin trawl systems are expected to become more popular in the future. Using two trawl nets will, in addition to <b>trawl</b> <b>doors</b> on each side, require a heavy clump weight in the middle to prevent the trawl nets lifting from the seabed. The largest clump weights can have a mass up to 9000 kg and can cause substantial load towed across subsea pipelines, and may in many cases be the governing design load with respect to external loads in pipeline design. The main objective in this thesis work was to simulate and investigate pull-over forces from clump weights on free spanning pipelines. All simulations were carried out in the computer software SIMLA. Six different small scale tests were simulated in order to verify the finite element model, a very good agreement was obtained. Design loads from trawl gear are generally implemented according to DNV-RP-F 111. The calculation methods provided in this recommended practice are based on the same small scale tests which was made available to this thesis work for verification purposes. The validity range of DNV-RP-F 111 reflects the range of the small scale tests i. e. only valid for rigid pipelines. The effect of increasing pipeline flexibility was investigated. Simulations were carried out for span heights 0. 25 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 75 m for a 12 ” pipeline. Two different pipeline models was applied, a 25 m rigid pipeline model with spring representing the lateral pipeline stiffness, and a 1000 m pipeline model including realistic soil resistance. The major finding was that pull-over forces decrease for increasing pipeline flexibility. Compared to DNV-RP-F 111 the obtained pull-over loads was found considerably lower, both in magnitude and duration. To avoid over-conservatism it is thus recommended that a design method accounting for pipeline flexibility should be developed and used in future pipeline designs. The effect of warp angle was simulated varying the warp line length from 2. 5 to 3. 5 times the water depth. The horizontal pull-over force was found to increase for increasing warp line length. Regarding clump weight design and towing configuration, simulations have shown that a forward clump weight center of gravity will reduce the pull-over loads. Applying a lower warp line attachment point resulted in a more uniform sliding motion of the clump weight during interference and pull-over loads was almost complete reduced to a case of initial impact. It is thus suggested that future clump weight design should reflect this to reduce interference loads on both trawl gear and subsea pipelines. </p...|$|R
40|$|The average catch {{per unit}} of swept area (CPUE) from bottom trawl surveys by {{research}} vessels are used as an index of abundance for the demersal fish resources of the Thai waters of the Andaman Sea. The surveys are carried out under the assumption of constant swept area and catch efficiency. However, preliminary investigations showed that the geometry varied by depth and based on other studies {{it is likely that}} this may affect CPUE. To reduce the variability in trawl geometry by depth, the constrictor rope technique was applied. The length of the rope (6 m) and its position (between the warps; 100 ahead of the <b>trawl</b> <b>doors)</b> were based on trials without rope at the shallowest depth trawled during the routine surveys (20 m). Using the constrictor rope at deeper depths gave similar trawl geometry as obtained at the reference depth of 20 m. When the trawl was fished with the constrictor rope 75 m depth, the mean door distance was reduced by 23 % compared to the door distance obtained for hauls without a constrictor rope. Similarly, wing distance was reduced by 18 % and the angle of the sweep/bridles was reduced from 20. 3 to 15 degrees (26 % reduction). The vertical trawl opening was increased marginally (0. 12 m; 6. 5 %) Despite the difference in trawl geometry, catch rates and catch composition did not differ significantly between the hauls made with and without the constrictor rope. The reason for this is unclear, but it is suggested that the larger area swept when no rope is used is offset by increased escape below the fishing line due to the trawl being overspread. Observations by underwater video cameras in the net mouth area during hauls at shallow depth and without constrictor rope, indicated proper bottom contact of the fishing line. It is therefore suggested that the trawl will have similar bottom contact at all depths when the constrictor rope is used. However, this needs to be verified. Observations of fish showed that fish took up position slightly in front of the fishing line, swimming in the direction of towing. Except for a few rays, no fish were observed to escape below the fishing line. Observations of trawl's fish lock showed that this did not function as intended as fish were observed to swim forward out of the codend during haul back of the trawl. v Sections of gillnet panels mounted to the outside of the top panel of the trawl, showed only marked escape during one haul and only close to the codend. The catch is this haul was approximately an order of magnitude higher than in the remaining hauls, suggesting a density dependent escape...|$|R
40|$|Since 1984, annual {{bottom trawl}} {{surveys of the}} west coast (California–Washington) upper {{continental}} slope (WCUCS) have provided information on the abundance, distribution, and biological characteristics of groundfish resources. Slope species of the deep-water complex (DWC) are of particular importance and include Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus; sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria; shortspine thornyhead, Sebastolobus alascanus; and longspine thornyhead, S. altivelis. In the fall of 1994, we conducted an experimental gear research cruise in lieu of our normal survey {{because of concerns about}} the performance of the survey trawl. The experiment was conducted on a soft mud bottom at depths of 460 – 490 m off the central Oregon coast. Treatments included different combinations of door-bridle rigging, groundgear weight, and scope length. The experimental design was a 2 ´ 2 ´ 2 factorial within a randomized complete-block. Analysis of variance was used {{to examine the effects of}} gear modifications on the engineering performance of the trawl (i. e. trawl dimensions, variation in <b>trawl</b> dimensions, and <b>door</b> attitude) and to determine if catch rates in terms of weight and number of DWC species and invertebrates were affected by the gear modifications. Trawl performance was highly variable for the historically used standard trawl configuration. Improvements were observed with the addition of either a 2 -bridle door or lighter ground gear. Changes in scope length had relatively little effect on trawl performance. The interaction of door bridle and ground gear weight had the most effect on trawl performance. In spite of the standard trawl’s erratic performance, catch rates of all four DWC species and invertebrates were not significantly different than the 2 -bridle/heavy combination, which did the best in terms of engineering performance. The most important factor affecting DWC catch rates was ground gear. Scope length and the type of door bridle had little effect on DWC catch rates. Subsequent revisions to survey gear and towing protocol and their impact on the continuity of the slope survey time series are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sea {{trials were}} {{performed}} on two zones with different fishing efforts on the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay ('Grande-VasiSre' area of muddy sand) {{in order to assess}} particulate matter resuspension and seabed disturbances (i. e., penetration, reworking, grain size changes) induced by different types of trawls. Optical and acoustic measurements made in the water column indicate a significant trawling-induced resuspension mainly due to the scraping action of doors. It manifests as a highly dynamic turbid plume confined near the seabed, where suspended sediment concentrations can reach 200 mg l(- 1). Concentration levels measured behind an "alternative" configuration (<b>trawls</b> with jumper <b>doors</b> instead of classical doors penetrating the sediment) are significantly lower (around 10 - 20 mg l(- 1)), which indicates a potential limiting impact regarding the seabed. Grain size analyses of the surficial sediment led to highlight a potential reworking influence of bottom trawling. On the intensively trawled zone, this reworking manifests as an upward coarsening trend in the first 5 cm of the cores. A significant decrease in mud content (30 %) has been also witnessed on this zone between 1967 and 2014, which suggests an influence on the seabed evolution. The geometric analysis of bottom tracks (4 - 5 -cm depth, 20 -cm width) observed with a benthic video sledge was used to compute an experimental trawling-induced erosion rate of 0. 13 kg m(- 2). This erosion rate was combined with fishing effort data, in order to estimate trawling-induced erosion fluxes which were then compared to natural erosion fluxes over the Grande-VasiSre at monthly, seasonal and annual scales. Winter storms control the annual resuspended load and trawling contribution to annual resuspension is in the order of 1 %. However, results show that trawling resuspension can become dominant during the fishing high season (i. e., until several times the natural one in summer). In addition, the contribution of trawling-induced resuspension is shown to increase with water depth, because of the rapid decay of wave effects. Finally, the seasonal evolution of the respective contributions for erosion (mainly trawling and waves) could be mapped for the whole study area...|$|R
