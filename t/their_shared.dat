5|$|According to <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E
5000|$|Closed-end funds {{generally}} issue {{shares to}} the public only once, when they are created through an initial public offering. <b>Their</b> <b>shares</b> are then listed for trading on a stock exchange. Investors who want to sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> must sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to another investor in the market; they cannot sell <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> back to the fund. The price that investors receive for <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> may be significantly different from NAV; it may be at a [...] "premium" [...] to NAV (i.e., higher than NAV) or, more commonly, at a [...] "discount" [...] to NAV (i.e., lower than NAV).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the trend in}} the importance of small producers in the Canadian and U. S. manufacturing sectors from the early 1970 s to the late 1990 s in order to investigate whether there was a common North American trend in changes in plant size. It finds that small plants in both countries increased <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of employment up to the 1990 s, but <b>their</b> <b>share</b> remained stable in the 1990 s. Small plants increased <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output up to the 1990 s, but then saw <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output decline. Over the entire time period, <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of output increased less than <b>their</b> <b>share</b> of employment and, therefore, their relative labour productivity has fallen. The similarity in the trends in the two countries suggests that causes of this phenomenon should be sought in similarities such as the technological environment rather than in country-specific factors like unionization or trade intensities.

5|$|Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, Duke of York, now {{second in}} line to the throne, evidently became close to May during <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a {{suitable}} candidate to marry a future king. In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, never took a mistress.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E

She was introduced to him by mutual friends {{of her husband and}} Univision producer Andres Baez. At the time, Chan was auditioning singers for the group Popvert. Chan said that he was first interested in collaborating with Chana due to her pitch; Chana reported that they initially bonded over <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> interest in 1980s music, such as that of Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Velocity Girl.|$|E

5000|$|In {{investment}} banking, {{the term}} [...] "securities lending" [...] {{is also used}} to describe a service offered to large investors who can allow the investment bank to lend out <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to other people. This is often done to investors of all sizes who have pledged <b>their</b> <b>shares</b> to borrow money to buy more shares, but large investors like pension funds often choose to do this to <b>their</b> unpledged <b>shares</b> because they will receive interest income. In these types of agreements, the investor still receives any dividends as normal, the only thing they cannot generally do is to vote <b>their</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R

At the same time, Brătianu kept a tight relationship with King Ferdinand.|$|E

In the context of chore division, envy-freeness means that each partner believes <b>their</b> <b>share</b> is at least as small as any other share. The crucial issue is that no partner would wish to swap <b>their</b> <b>share</b> with any other partner.|$|R

5|$|The New Age {{has also}} been {{identified}} by various scholars of religion {{as part of the}} cultic milieu.

5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. Even where they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. <b>Their</b> <b>shared</b> attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E

5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of his}} ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E

He agreed {{to write the}} musical score for Massot's film Wonderwall in October 1967, after the Bee Gees had become unavailable. It was Harrison's first formal music project outside the Beatles and coincided with his {{continued}} immersion in Indian classical music. Since 1966, this association with India had given Harrison a distinct musical identity beside the band's primary songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. While he had minimal interest in the Beatles' main projects during 1967 – the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and their television film Magical Mystery Tour – Harrison led the group in terms of <b>their</b> <b>shared</b> philosophical direction, as his bandmates followed him in embracing Transcendental Meditation {{under the guidance of}} Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.|$|E

After Jogaila's baptism, he was known in Poland by his baptismal name Władysław and the Polish version of his Lithuanian name, Jagiełło.
