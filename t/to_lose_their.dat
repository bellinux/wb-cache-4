5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights}} of Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E

Hopkins beat Maryland handily, 30–6, and the Aggies went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> next three games to finish the year with a 2–4 mark. The 1898 season saw the Aggies finish 2–5–1 and in 1899, the team {{canceled}} the remainder of its season after accumulating a 1–4 record. Maryland saw a marginal improvement to 3–4–1 in 1900, but then fell to a 1–7 season in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E

Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|Carey's {{actions were}} given mixed reception, with critics and {{executives}} both commending her bold actions towards a song she felt {{needed to be}} heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the scandal further. Soon after, Sony involved themselves further, stripping Carey's webpage of any messages and began trying {{to reach an agreement}} with her. Fearing <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> label's highest seller, and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon found out that the song had only been allowed a very limited and low-promotion release, not allowing the song to chart on the official US chart, and making international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.|$|E

5|$|England and France {{were in the}} {{concluding}} stages of the Hundred Years War. The French did not wish <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were {{in no position to}} do so. Spain was {{in the final stages of}} the Reconquista. The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{suffered}} a minor setback prior to Euro 2000 {{with a sore}} thigh muscle. However, he resumed training and was declared fit for the Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought about the only goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars' cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team's 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team's ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, {{but it was an}} unsuccessful campaign as they failed to qualify for the finals.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> {{next three}} games. Buffalo {{was unable to}} keep up with No.5-ranked Missouri, losing 42–21 in a game that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season. In the next contest, against MAC opponent Central Michigan, down ninepoints with under threeminutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard pass to James Starks, recovered an onside kick to retain possession, and attempted a game-winning field goal—but A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the right goalpost to give Central Michigan the victory. In the next game, against the Western Michigan Broncos, also in the MAC, Buffalo squandered a two-touchdown advantage with just over five minutes left, allowing the Broncos to win the game in overtime. Buffalo's overall record fell to 2–4, 1–2 in the MAC.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
5|$|Through {{their first}} nine {{games of the}} year, the Jets went 5–4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year consideration. The team {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> next three contests as the rookie Smith committed eight turnovers while failing to score during that stretch. This prompted speculation by analysts {{as to whether or}} not Ryan would be fired. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37–27 win over the Raiders that kept them in playoff contention. The following week, the Jets played the Carolina Panthers and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter. In the span of five minutes, the Panthers scored twice and the Jets were unable to complete a comeback attempt, losing 20–30. The loss eliminated the Jets from playoff contention.|$|E
50|$|Burrowing is a slang {{term used}} in the United States to {{describe}} the practice in which political appointees are given civil service protection. Except for judges, political appointees are subject <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> jobs when a new administration takes power. On the other hand, career government officials are protected from <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> jobs when a new administration takes over. Burrowing is therefore the practice of reassigning {{people who do not}} have civil service protection into jobs that have civil service protection.|$|R
50|$|A Thousand Times Repent, also stylized as ATTR, was a Christian metal {{band that}} was last signed to Tribunal Records, a record label that also holds bands such as He Is Legend, Century, and Prayer For Cleansing.

The EP has received multiple good reviews.|$|R
50|$|The White Lords of Law {{are much}} less {{developed}} than the Lords of Chaos. The stories are set in a cosmic cycle when Chaos is most powerful. Furthermore, Elric's alliance with Arioch means that he interacts chiefly with the Chaos Lords. When they appear, the Lords of Law are usually more benevolent than the Chaos Lords, who are seductive but also sinister and prone <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>their</b> temper.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, castles tended <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> {{military}} significance due to {{the advent}} of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.|$|E
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs {{in the weeks after}} the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E

The Tide went on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> final two games in the postseason to end the season 12–2. They lost to the Florida Gators (31–20) in the SEC Championship Game, and to the Utah Utes (31–17) in the Sugar Bowl. Alabama reached No.1 in the AP and Coaches' Polls {{for the first time}} since the final polls in 1992 and during the regular season {{for the first time since}} 1980 between weeks ten and fourteen.
