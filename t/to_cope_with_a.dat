5|$|In March 2015 {{work began}} on a £12m upgrade to the flood defence scheme {{to upgrade the}} {{protection}} <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 100-year flood. The scheme, which was due {{to be completed in}} December 2015, involves creating a flood storage basin {{to the north of the}} Castle Irwell student village. An area of 29 hectares will be excavated and the material will be used to construct a 3 metre high embankment around the site.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome able <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is too slow <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact {{after the first}} bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 {{there have been a}} total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E

5|$|The King's Speech is a 2010 British {{historical}} drama film {{directed by}} Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian {{speech and language therapist}} played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends {{as they work}} together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{end result}} of the air {{campaign}} against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched and was unable <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be}} a Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|While intensifying, Cyclone Favio {{brushed the}} {{southern}} tip of Madagascar while bringing heavy rains to the nation. Along the southeastern portion of the nation, road access was reduced. Favio disrupted relief operations to 582,000people, who were struggling <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drought in the southern portion of the nation. Moreover, the cyclone disrupted relief efforts during an aftermath of flood that killed three persons and displaced 33,000people throughout the country. Overall, the cyclone was one of several storms to affect the nation during the season.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had even begun. The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched and was unable <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> multi-front war.

5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E

5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

At the time Tulkarm was divided into four main sections, with the bulk of commercial activity concentrated along the north-south and east-west roads. Meanwhile, urban sprawl continued to expand past the northern fringes of the town, which had previously been characterized by green spaces.|$|E
