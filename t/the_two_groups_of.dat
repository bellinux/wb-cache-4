5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that occurred before the kick-off.

The disaster prompted UEFA to ban English clubs from European football for five years.|$|E
5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed.

5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E

They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe.

The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} 1984–85 European Cup as champions, {{and once again}} progressed to the final, where their opponents were Juventus of Italy. They aimed to win their fifth European Cup and keep the trophy. The 1985 European Cup Final {{was held at the}} Heysel Stadium in Brussels. The choice of venue had been criticised due to the {{dilapidated}} state of the stadium, and the club tried to persuade UEFA to change the venue. Before the kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> supporters and charged the Juventus fans.

Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years.
