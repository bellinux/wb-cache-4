5|$|To defeat <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
500|$|While the Sejm {{comprised}} representatives only of {{the nobility}} and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers (townspeople), who {{in the fall of}} 1789 organized a Black Procession, demonstrating their desire {{to be part of the}} political process. Taking a cue from similar events in France, and with the fear that if burghers' demands were not met, their peaceful protests could turn violent, the Sejm on April 18, 1791 adopted a law addressing the status of the cities and the rights of the burghers (the Free Royal Cities Act). Together with the legislation on <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Act</b> on Sejmiks of [...] March 24, 1791), it became incorporated into the final constitution.|$|R

5|$|Since 1985 the {{government}} of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected {{from each of the}} seven city council single-member districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business. This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.

Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E

2500|$|Modern US {{labor law}} mostly comes from {{statutes}} passed between 1935 and 1974, and changing {{interpretations of the}} US Supreme Court. However, laws regulated the rights of people at work and employers from colonial times on. Before the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the common law was either uncertain or hostile to labor rights. Unions were classed as conspiracies, and potentially criminal. It tolerated slavery and indentured servitude. From the Pequot War in Connecticut from 1636 onwards, Native Americans were enslaved by European settlers. More {{than half of the}} European immigrants arrived as prisoners, or in indentured servitude, where they were not free to leave their employers until a debt bond had been repaid. Until its abolition, the Atlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to do forced labor in the Americas. However, in 1772, the English Court of King's Bench held in Somerset v Stewart that slavery was to be presumed unlawful at common law. Charles Stewart from Boston, Massachusetts had bought James Somerset as a slave and taken him to England. With the help of abolitionists, Somerset escaped and sued for a writ of habeas corpus (that [...] "holding his body" [...] had been unlawful). Lord Mansfield, after declaring he should [...] "let justice be done whatever be the consequence", held that slavery was [...] "so odious" [...] that nobody could take [...] "a slave by force to be sold" [...] for any [...] "reason whatever". This was a major grievance of southern slave owning states, leading up to the American Revolution in 1776. The 1790 United States Census recorded 694,280 slaves (17.8 per cent) of a total 3,893,635 population. After independence, the British Empire halted the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and abolished slavery in its own territories, by paying off slave owners in 1833. In the US, northern states progressively abolished slavery. However, southern states did not. In Dred Scott v Sandford the Supreme Court held the federal government could not regulate slavery, and also that people who were slaves had no legal rights in court. The American Civil War was the result. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 made abolition of slavery a war aim, and the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 enshrined the abolition of slavery in the Constitution. Former slave owners were further prevented from holding people in involuntary servitude for debt by the Peonage Act of 1867. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment ensured equal access to justice, and the Fifteenth Amendment required that everyone would have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>vote.</b> <b>The</b> Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1875 was also meant to ensure equality in access to housing and transport, but in the Civil Rights Cases, the Supreme Court found it was [...] "unconstitutional", ensuring that racial segregation would continue. In dissent, Harlan J said the majority was leaving people [...] "practically at the mercy of corporations". Even if people were formally free, they remained factually dependent on property owners for work, income and basic services.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee was {{the first}} committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, {{but it did not}} file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E
