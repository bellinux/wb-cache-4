5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was {{embodied in the}} Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as {{acting on behalf of}} the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer on the field of battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

40|$|Emergency Blood Service using Android is an {{application}} {{that can be}} installed in any Android mobile phones {{and can be used}} at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> when someone is in need for blood. The project proposed will reveal the identity of the users only at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> donation of blood. The authentication is not provided for the application usage and hence the application can be accessed from anyone’s mobile at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> The identity <b>of</b> all the users of the application are hidden. Anyone can easily access the application from anyone’s mobile. Hence even a stranger can become a helping hand at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> The location <b>of</b> the users can’t be updated all the time. Hence the location of the requestor is also found at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> The users willing to donate blood can acknowledge the request. Misusing the numbers of any user of the application is totally avoided since even the user who is requesting for blood cannot view others details. The details of the donor will be provided to the requestor only at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> Updating the location is also not needed since the application tracks the location...|$|R

25|$|Besides this regular {{method of}} direct recruitment, the Republic {{occasionally}} used extraordinary methods.

These were troops hired on temporary contracts (in contradistinction with regular troops, who were hired for the duration) to perform guard duties in garrisoned cities when the regular troops were away on campaign during the summer months. But in time of emergency they sometimes {{were sent to the}} mobile army.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} amateur radio {{can be traced}} to the late 19th century, but amateur radio as practiced today began in the early 20th century. The First Annual Official Wireless Blue Book of the Wireless Association of America, {{produced}} in 1909, contains a list of amateur radio stations. This radio callbook lists wireless telegraph stations in Canada and the United States, including 89 amateur radio stations. As with radio in general, amateur radio was associated with various amateur experimenters and hobbyists. Amateur radio enthusiasts have significantly contributed to science, engineering, industry, and social services. Research by amateur operators has founded new industries, built economies, empowered nations, and saved lives in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> Ham radio can also be used in the classroom to teach English, map skills, geography, math, science, and computer skills.|$|E
25|$|In January 1953 the IAF {{formed the}} flight academy's fleet of Stearmans into a reserve liaison and {{surveillance}} unit, to be activated in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> Seconded to 100 Squadron, the unit was initially designated 1000 Squadron, but was redesignated 147 Squadron on January 1, 1955. It was activated on October 27, 1956, for the Suez Crisis. Commanded by Captain Meir Shefer, the unit had 25 servicable aircraft but only 12 pilots, consisting of both reserves and qualified students and including Rina Levinson, {{one of a}} handful of female pilots serving with the IAF. 147 Squadron flew 401 sorties during the war, clocking 233 hours. Flying from Ramla, next to IAF headquarters, the squadron flew communications, liaison, transport, patrol and reconnaissance missions, operating during both day and night. Once the fighting was over, the aircraft reverted to their original training role and the squadron was deactivated.|$|E

25|$|Special Constables {{were first}} {{introduced}} by the Special Constables Act 1831, empowering Magistrates to appoint ordinary citizens as temporary police officers in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> In 1834, the Act was extended to allow citizens appointed as Specials to act outside of their Parish area. In 1848, 150,000 Specials were sworn in, to assist regular officers in preventing Chartists from reaching Kennington, and then marching to Westminster. In 1912, the Specials were reorganised, scrapping the old system of anyone being liable to be appointed, instead they had to volunteer. In 1934, it was named the Metropolitan Special Constabulary(MSC), a name which it keeps today in its present form. For {{a short period of}} time after the MSC was formed, Specials did not receive uniforms like that of a full-time policeman. Instead, they were issued with armbands which identified them as Special Constables, along with being issued a truncheon and a whistle.|$|E
25|$|In a few cases, a {{national}} telecommunication agency may also allow hams to use frequencies {{outside of the}} internationally allocated amateur radio bands. In Trinidad and Tobago, hams are allowed to use a repeater which is located on 148.800MHz. This repeater is used and maintained by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), but may be used by radio amateurs in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> or during normal times to test their capability and conduct emergency drills. This repeater {{can also be used}} by non-ham NEMA staff and REACT members. In Australia and New Zealand ham operators are authorized to use one of the UHF TV channels. In the U.S., amateur radio operators providing essential communication needs in connection with the immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property when normal communication systems are not available may use any frequency including those of other radio services such as police and fire and in cases of disaster in Alaska may use the statewide emergency frequency of 5167.5kHz with restrictions upon emissions.|$|E
25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was helpless and could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> A Wireless transmitter-receiver station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide ships and boats through the jagged rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E

25|$|To {{a certain}} degree, kings acted {{as agents of}} the law. However, while other kings in Europe were able to {{promulgate}} law, such as Alfred the Great and his Doom book, the Irish had very little authority to do so. They could collaborate on law authored by the church. Cáin Adomnáin has the names of many kings attached to it who apparently enacted and enforced the law. Additionally, a king could issue a temporary law in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> But kings could not, by their own authority, issue permanent law codes. Kings also acted as judges, although {{the extent of their}} power compared to that of professional jurists has been debated. One law tract, Gubretha Caratniad, describes a brithem giving advice to a king (in this case, advice that seems flawed but is actually correct) who then gives it as judgment in a case. It is unclear, therefore, how much kings made judgments by themselves and how much they had to follow professional advice. It is clear, however, that a king had to judge in accordance with the laws. However, the kings do not appear to have stood as judges in all cases, and in some cases the professional jurists took that role.|$|E
25|$|The Governor of Indiana {{serves as}} the chief {{executive}} of the state and has the authority to manage the government as established in the Constitution of Indiana. The governor and the lieutenant governor are jointly elected to four-year terms, with gubernatorial elections running concurrent with United States presidential elections (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, etc.). The governor may not serve more than two consecutive terms. The governor works with the Indiana General Assembly and the Supreme Court of Indiana to govern the state and has the authority to adjust the other branches. Special sessions of the General Assembly can be called upon by the governor as well as have the power to select and remove leaders of nearly all state departments, boards and commissions. Other notable powers include calling out the Indiana Guard Reserve or the Indiana National Guard in <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency</b> or disaster, issuing pardons or commuting the sentence of any criminal offenders except in cases of treason or impeachment and possessing an abundant amount of statutory authority. The lieutenant governor {{serves as the}} President of the Senate and is responsible for ensuring that the senate rules are acted in accordance with by its constituents. The lieutenant governor can only vote to break ties. If the governor dies in office, becomes permanently incapacitated, resigns or is impeached, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If both the governor and lieutenant governor positions are unoccupied, the Senate President pro tempore becomes governor.|$|E
25|$|In 66 BC Catiline, {{the leader}} of the plot, {{presented}} his candidacy for the consulship, but he was charged with extortion and his candidacy was disallowed because he announced it too late. In 65 BC he was brought to trial along with other men who had carried out killings during the proscriptions (persecutions) of Lucius Cornelius Sulla when the dictator had declared many of his political opponents enemies of the state (81 BC). He received the support of many prominent men and he was acquitted through bribery. In 63 BC Catiline was a candidate for the consulship again. He presented himself as the champion of debtors. Catiline was defeated again and Marcus Tullius Cicero and Gaius Antonius Hybrida were elected. He plotted a coup d'état together with a group of fellow aristocrats and disaffected veterans as a means of preserving his dignitas. One the conspirators, Gaius Manlius, assembled an army in Etruria and civil unrest was prepared in various parts of Italy. Catiline was to lead the conspiracy in Rome, which would have involved arson and the murder of senators. He was then to join Manlius in a march on Rome. The plot was to start with the murder of Cicero. Cicero discovered this, exposed the conspiracy, and produced evidence for the arrest of five conspirators. He had them executed without trial with the backing of a final decree of the Senate – a decree the senate issued at <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>emergency.</b> This was done because it was feared that the arrested men might be freed by other plotters. Julius Caesar opposed this measure. When Catiline heard of this he led his forces in Pistoria (Pistoia) with the intention of escaping to northern Italy. He was engaged in battle and defeated.|$|E
