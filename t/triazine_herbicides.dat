Grain markets have changed substantially since that time; for example, {{the size of the}} US maize market increased by 170 % from 1990 – 1992 to 2007 – 2009. This paper reports a current {{assessment of the}} economic benefits of atrazine. RESULTS: Yield increases and cost changes implied by <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> are projected to reduce maize prices by 7 – 8 % and sorghum prices by 19 – 20 %. Projected consumer benefits from lower prices range from $US 3. 6 to 4. 4 × 109 annually, with the net projected economic benefit for <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> to the US economy ranging from $US 2. 9 to 3. 4 × 109 annually because lower prices imply reduced producer income. Productivity gains from <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> maintain an estimated 270 000 – 390 000 ha of land in non-crop uses that generate environmental benefits not accounted for in this analysis.

40|$|This {{technical}} report describes {{a method to}} use the AGSIM policy model to estimate changes in soil erosion and diesel fuel consumption for tillage that result from agricultural policy changes. This report uses <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> {{as a case study}} to explain the development of the method and illustrate its use. The method assumes farmers shift their adoption of different tillage systems {{as a result of the}} agricultural policy being examined. Based on these shifts in tillage adoption rates, changes in farmer costs, erosion rates, and consumption of diesel fuel for tillage occur. The changes in farm costs are used as input by AGSIM, along with other changes in costs and/or yields due to the agricultural policy being examined. Based on these inputs, AGSIM then projects crop acreage and prices, as well as changes in consumer surplus, that would occur as a result of the policy. Based on projected crop acreage changes, the method estimates changes in soil erosion and consumption of diesel fuel for tillage, as well as the monetary value of soil erosion changes and the carbon dioxide emission changes resulting from the fuel use changes. As an illustration of the method, this report presents an updated assessment of the benefits of <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> to the U. S. economy. For the base year of 2009, this assessment finds that <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> provide total benefits to the U. S. economy of $ 3. 8 to $ 4. 8 billion per year. Because the <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> increase the total supply of corn and sorghum, which decreases grain prices, most of these benefits accrue to consumers, especially the livestock and ethanol industries that are major users of corn. These consumer benefits are the sum of the benefits flowing to everyone along the supply chain [...] livestock farmers, processors and handlers, distributors, retailers, and final consumers. <b>Triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> also reduce the use of tillage for crop production and the conversion of land to crop production, which reduces soil erosion from U. S. cropland by 56 to 85 million tons per year. Based on these reductions, <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> provide $ 210 to $ 350 million per year in benefits from reduced soil erosion as part of this total benefit to the U. S. economy. In addition, <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> reduce consumption of diesel fuel for tillage by 18 to 28 million gallons per year, implying a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions of 180, 000 to 280, 000 metric tons per year. This total benefit of $ 3. 8 to $ 4. 8 billion is a lower bound on the full value of <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> to the U. S. economy, because several benefits are not accounted for in this assessment. Among the most substantial benefits missing from this assessment are estimates of the resistance management benefits of <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> for other herbicides and crops, environmental benefits other than reduced soil erosion, and the benefits to crops not modeled by AGSIM (e. g., sweet corn, sugarcane, citrus, grapes, and other fruits and nuts). ...|$|E

40|$|U. S. crop {{producers}} derive substantial {{economic benefits}} from the chloro-s-triazine herbicides atrazine, simazine and propazine. These <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> generate yield gains for U. S. crop farmers, and in many cases, also reduce total costs for herbicides. Atrazine, {{the most widely used}} triazine herbicide, is the keystone of herbicide-based weed control in corn and other regionally important crops in the U. S. Corn acreage, yields and prices have increased over time so that the three-year average value of corn produced in the U. S. has increased more than 2. 7 times, from $ 18. 6 billion in 1990 - 1992 to $ 50. 9 billion in 2007 - 2009. Over this same period, crop production practices also evolved, including the widespread adoption of transgenic crops and reduced tillage systems. Given these and other changes since previous economic assessments of the producer benefits from <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides,</b> an update assessment seems warranted. The primary benefit of atrazine and the other <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> to farmers is improved weed control that increases harvested yields and usually reduces costs, as alternative herbicides are less effective and/or more expensive. Based on yield loss and herbicide cost changes estimated using models, the economic value of the yield losses prevented by the <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> are estimated to range between $ 3. 0 and $ 3. 3 billion per year for U. S. corn, sorghum, sweet corn, and sugarcane farmers. Most of these benefits accrue to Midwestern field corn farmers using atrazine, but farmers in other regions and growing these other crops also derive substantial benefits. The annual yield benefits and net herbicide cost savings from <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> are worth an estimated $ 2. 36 to $ 2. 65 billion for U. S. field corn growers, $ 341 million for U. S. sorghum growers, $ 210 million for U. S. sweet corn growers, and between $ 60 and $ 120 million for U. S. sugarcane growers. Atrazine and the other <b>triazine</b> <b>herbicides</b> generate other types of benefits for farmers not accounted for in these reported values. Atrazine works well with other herbicides, often enhancing the value of less efficacious herbicides. Atrazine also increases the value of crop rotations by reducing weed populations and weed seed banks in crops commonly rotated with atrazine-treated crops. Atrazine also serves as an important tool for managing herbicide resistance, helping to preserve future weed control benefits for other herbicides. Finally, atrazine provides effective weed control that has aided adoption of conservation tillage and no-till systems in corn and other crops. Reducing or eliminating tillage reduces soil erosion and associated negative environmental impacts of agriculture, which improves water quality and further enhances the sustainability of U. S. crop production. Because specific dollar-denominated estimates of the value of these benefits to farmers are not included in this assessment, the estimated $ 3. 0 to $ 3. 3 billion in benefits per year should be considered a lower bound on the full value of the benefits generated by atrazine and the other chloro-s-triazine herbicides in U. S. crop production. ...|$|E

Phase 1 of the study consists of the screening of 54 Austin area springs for total triazine compounds. A low-cost rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening indicated that 55 % of spring samples had total triazine concentrations of between 0. 035 and 0. 881 µg/l, relatively low compared to the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 3 µg/l. Variability of the concentration of triazine compounds was examined by sampling selected springs during various antecedent weather conditions. The data indicate that antecedent weather condition and rainfall affect triazine compound concentrations to differing degrees depending upon the spring. However, at least two springs, Backdoor and Stillhouse Springs, showed relatively consistent triazine concentrations on all sampling dates. In addition, two springs, Upper Barton and Spicewood Springs, respond similarly to a similar size rainfall event...|$|R

Our {{research has shown}} that the presence of macrophytes and a hydrologic regime aid in the transfer and transformation of pesticides associated with agricultural runoff. This study consisted of application of both atrazine (<b>triazine</b> <b>herbicide)</b> and lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid insecticide) to vegetated and unvegetated microcosms in order to measure the fate and effects of pesticides applied at suggested field application rates. Exposures focused on monocultures of Ludwigia peploides (water primrose) and Juncus effusus (soft rush). Pesticide sorption was evident through concentrations of atrazine and lambda-cyhalothrin in plant tissue as high as 2461. 4 and 86. 50 g/kg, respectively. Toxicity was measured in water from unvegetated microcosms for 28 days and in Chironomus tentans (midge larvae) exposed to sediment collected from 3 h to 56 days in microcosms receiving the pesticide combination. The comparative survival of test organisms in this study suggests that effective mitigation of pesticides from runoff can depend on the macrophyte contact an...|$|R
