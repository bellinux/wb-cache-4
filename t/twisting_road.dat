500|$|An {{aspect of}} Abbas Kiarostami's artistry that eludes those {{unfamiliar}} with Persian poetry {{and that has}} therefore remained inaccessible to many {{is the way he}} turns poetic images into cinematic ones. This is most obvious in those Kiarostami films that recall specific texts of Persian poetry more or less explicitly: Where's the Friend's Home? and The Wind will Carry Us. The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayyám or modern Persian poets Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad. One of the most poetic moments in Wind Will Carry Us is a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter down a <b>twisting</b> <b>road.</b> In response to his comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam: ...|$|E

60|$|She {{shook the}} whip, {{and as they}} clattered away down the steep, <b>twisting</b> <b>road,</b> Nasmyth glanced with {{satisfaction}} to left and right. He had seen wilder and grander lands, {{but none of them}} appealed to him like this high, English waste. On one hand dim black hills rose out of fleecy mist; on the other a leafless birch wood, close by, stood out in curiously fragile and delicate tracery against a paling saffron glow, though overhead the sky was barred with motionless gray cloud. A sharp smell of peat-smoke followed them as they clattered past a low white cottage with a yellow glow in one window; and then the earthy scent of rotting leaves replaced it as they plunged into the gloom of an oak wood beneath the birches. A stream splashing down a hollow made faint music in the midst of it. When they had emerged from the shadow and climbed a steep rise, wide moors stretched away in front, rising and falling in long undulations, streaked with belts of mist. The crying of restless plovers came out of the gathering dimness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{search for}} {{the origins of the}} Holocaust began almost as soon as World War II ended. At the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials of 1945-6, the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question in Europe" [...] was {{represented}} by the prosecution as part of long-term plan {{on the part of the}} Nazi leadership going back to the foundations of the Nazi Party in 1919. Subsequently, most historians subscribed to what would be today considered to be the extreme intentionalist interpretation. Starting in the late 1960s with the publication of such work as Martin Broszat's The Hitler State in 1969 and Karl Schleunes' The <b>Twisted</b> <b>Road</b> to Auschwitz in 1970, a number of historians challenged the prevailing interpretation and suggested there was no master plan for the Holocaust. In the 1970s, advocates of the intentionalist school of thought were known as [...] "the straight road to Auschwitz" [...] camp or as the [...] "programmeists", because they insisted that Hitler was fulfilling a programme. Advocates of the functionalist school were known as [...] "the <b>twisted</b> <b>road</b> to Auschwitz" [...] camp or as the [...] "structuralists", because of their insistence that it was the internal power structures of the Third Reich that led to the Holocaust.|$|R
