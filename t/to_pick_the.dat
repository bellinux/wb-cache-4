5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> painted turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.|$|E
5|$|In episode 8, Team GSP {{had to pick}} which {{team members}} would fight each other (considering they had 5 members in the quarter-finals). St. Pierre asked each member <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> fighter they wanted to fight. Johnson and Alex Caceres picked each other and a fight was scheduled. Johnson won by {{unanimous}} decision after two rounds, earning himself {{a spot in the}} semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|Once an all-human {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now {{used to determine}} future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involve many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.|$|E
50|$|Example: The pool {{contains}} Ace, 2, 2, 4 and 10 {{in varying}} suits. A player needs {{to play a}} 10 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> ace, a 9 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up either {{by one of the}} both twos, an 8 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> Ace and one of the 2’s, a 7 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 4 or both of the 2’s, a 6 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> Ace and either the 4 or both 2’s, a 5 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 4 and one of the 2’s, a 4 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 4, a 2 and the Ace, a 3 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 4 and both 2’s, a 2 <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 4, both 2’s and the Ace, or an Ace <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up <b>the</b> 10.

5|$|As a {{particularly}} conspicuous forest flower, T. grandiflorum was designated the provincial emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Flora Emblem Act), {{and as the}} state wild flower of Ohio in 1987. As a symbol of Ontario, a stylized trillium flower features prominently on the official flag of the province's French-speaking community. It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike widely believed, specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> species in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> forward pass {{out of the air}} on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action quite like that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E

5|$|After {{having a}} {{particularly}} bad day at school, Bart gets {{caught in a}} downpour and loses control of his skateboard. He crashes down the stairwell of the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club, a Mafia bar owned by the Springfield Mafia. Fat Tony, {{the leader of the}} Mafia, and his henchmen Legs and Louie are initially inhospitable towards Bart, but they are impressed by his ability <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> winning horse in a horse race on the radio. When Bart makes up an excellent Manhattan cocktail for the mobsters, Fat Tony hires him as their bartender and errand boy. As Bart adopts more and more gangster-like traits, Marge grows anxious and tells Homer to go and meet the Mafia, but Homer approves of them after they let him win at poker.|$|E
5|$|On the June 21 {{episode of}} Raw, after Ted DiBiase fired Virgil, Maryse became DiBiase's new {{personal}} assistant. At Money in the Bank, on July 18, Maryse accompanied DiBiase in his Money in the Bank ladder {{match for the}} WWE Championship contract, which she tried <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> briefcase, but was stopped by John Morrison. Along with DiBiase, Maryse was announced as a mentor for Brodus Clay for the fourth season of NXT on November 30. On Raw, on December 13, Maryse {{was involved in a}} battle royal to determine the winner of the Diva of the Year Slammy Award, but was eliminated by Natalya. Clay traded his mentors, Maryse and DiBiase, for Alberto Del Rio on the January 25, 2011 episode of NXT. In late September 2010, Maryse was involved in an storyline with Goldust, in which he stole the Million Dollar Championship from DiBiase, and lost a subsequent mixed tag team match against Goldust and Aksana on October 26.|$|E
5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, {{and knowledge of}} model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange for the right <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million. The combined $5.65million payout was the seventh-largest among all {{college football}} bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game payout.|$|E

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly shook English {{confidence}} in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who {{up to that point}} had been untroubled, failed <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. Bob Wyatt came in and was clean bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just {{before the end of the}} first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O'Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.|$|E

At the Destination X episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys were defeated by The Wolves in a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The next week, Matt {{was one of many}} TNA wrestlers who stopped Dixie Carter from running away from Team 3D, which led to Carter being put through a table. On the August 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Team 3D (formerly the Dudley Boyz) challenged The Hardys to a match, which Team 3D won. At the Hardcore Justice episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D talked about a match involving themselves and The Wolves. When The Wolves were asked by the two teams, they agreed. Later that night, Kurt Angle announced all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with the winners of the first match choosing the stipulation of the next one. The Hardys won the second match of the series on the September 10 episode of Impact Wrestling in a tables match and choose a ladder match for the third match of the series. The Hardys were unsuccessful in winning that match on the September 17 episode of Impact Wrestling, as the Wolves won that match. The Wolves then went on <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> final match of the series to be a Full Metal Mayhem match to take place on the October 8 episode of Impact Wrestling. The Hardys were unsuccessful in that match as the Wolves won that match.|$|E
