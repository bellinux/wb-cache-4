5|$|Criminal mastermind <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin.

Arriving at the danger zone, Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, <b>the</b> <b>Hood,</b> disguised {{as one of the}} airport police detachment, breaks into the unmanned Thunderbird 1 and photographs the cockpit. Scott is alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> flees, chased along the M1 motorway by the police.|$|E

5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back <b>the</b> <b>hood,</b> and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face.

5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft.

5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E

50|$|To reduce lab {{ventilation}} energy costs, variable {{air volume}} (VAV) systems are employed, which reduce {{the volume of}} the air exhausted as <b>the</b> fume <b>hood</b> sash is closed. This product is often enhanced by an automatic sash closing device, which will close <b>the</b> fume <b>hood</b> sash when <b>the</b> user leaves <b>the</b> fume <b>hood</b> face. <b>The</b> result is that <b>the</b> <b>hoods</b> are operating at the minimum exhaust volume whenever no one is actually working in front of them.|$|R
5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9.

He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
