5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking.</b> Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, fluid catalytic cracking was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking</b> processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking,</b> still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. <b>Thermal</b> <b>cracking</b> remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke, and more sophisticated forms of <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking</b> have been developed for various purposes.

Although the bond dissociation energy D for a carbon-carbon single bond is relatively high (about 375 kJ/mol) and cracking is highly endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the extremely high temperature, makes T∆S° term larger than the ∆H° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction.|$|E

40|$|Thermally induced {{fractures}} or <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks,</b> {{and pronounced}} seismic events as snowquakes were studied at Mizuho Station, East Antarctica from June 1976 to January 1977. Fractures due to thermal stress {{were found in}} the uppermost 50 cm of the snow cover as a result of snow temperature decrease at the surface, and fracture under tensile thermal stress occurs when the stress exceeds the tensile strength of snow. Once <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks</b> are initiated, stress concentration occurs at tips of cracks, and fractures occur more easily in the smaller thermal stress than the tensile strength of snow and accompany more easily pronounced seismic events, that is, snowquake. Snowquakes occur during the decrease of temperature and then thermally induced strain rate corresponds to ductile fracture of snow. The individual snowquakes occur in the near surface and the epicenters of snowquakes located by seismic observations are found near <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks,</b> which indicates that snowquake is caused by the formation of cracks. The epicenters are not distributed in a well-ordered sequence, thus the fractures of snow cover occur at random in the near surface which is under the tensile stress during the decrease of snow temperature...|$|R
25|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking</b> {{reaction}} is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.|$|E

Since then, most plants now are using integrated, balanced DC– EDC – Oxy – EDC –VCM processes and more than 90% of the vinyl chloride presently produced in the Western World is derived from ethylene.|$|E
25|$|Cracking breaks larger {{molecules}} {{into smaller}} ones. This {{can be done}} with a thermal or catalytic method. The <b>thermal</b> <b>cracking</b> process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free-radicals. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites), which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C–C scission in position beta (i.e., cracking) and intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.|$|E

40|$|We report {{simultaneous}} laboratory {{measurements of}} seismic velocities and fluid permeability on lava flow basalt from Etna (Italy). Results {{were obtained for}} dry and saturated samples deformed under triaxial compression. During each test, the effective pressure was first increased up to 190 MPa to investigate the effect of pre-existing crack closure on seismic properties. Then, the effective pressure was unloaded down to 20 MPa, a pressure which mirrors the stress field acting under a lava pile of approximately 1. 5 – 2 km thick, and deviatoric stress was increased until failure of the specimens. Using an effective medium model, the measured elastic wave velocities were inverted in terms of two crack densities: ρi the crack density of the pre-existing <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks</b> and ρv the crack density of the stress-induced cracks. In addition a link was established between elastic properties (elastic wave velocities Vp and Vs) and permeability using a statistical permeability model. Our {{results show that the}} velocities increase with increasing hydrostatic pressure up to 190 MPa, due to the closure of the pre-existing <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks.</b> This is interpreted by a decrease of the crack density ρi from ~ 1 to 0. 2. The effect of pre-existing cracks closure is also highlighted by the permeability evolution which decreases of more than two orders of magnitude. Under deviatoric loading, the velocities signature is interpreted, in the first stage of the loading, by the closure of the pre-existing <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks.</b> However, with increasing deviatoric loading newly-formed vertical cracks nucleate and propagate. This is clearly seen from the velocity signature and its interpretation in term of crack density, from the location of the acoustic emission sources, and from microstructural observations. This competition between pre-existing cracks closure and propagation of vertical cracks is also seen from the permeability evolution, and our study shows that mechanically-induced cracks has lesser influence on permeability change than pre-existing <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perforatability {{and thermal}} damages of dental hard tissues with {{two kinds of}} YAG laser are {{investigated}} {{for the purpose of}} making the cavity and forming the abutment tooth. The perforatability of dentin with laser beam depends on the absorptivity for laser beam, the laser power, the pulse duration and the number of laser pulses. Approximately 65 % of Er:YAG laser beam is absorbed at irradiated surface of dentin, but the absorptivity for Nd:YAG laser beam is only 17 %. High perforatability is accomplished using Er:YAG laser because of its higher absorptivity. There is a linear relation between the perforated depth and the number of pulses. Higher laser power and larger pulse duration improve the perforatability, in the same time, induce thermal damages on dental hard tissue such as <b>thermal</b> <b>cracks</b> and burning of dentin.

Schimmelmann et al. confirmed that alkane fractions have almost the same D/H ratios as whole oils. Depending on source material type and maturity, δD of n-alkanes can vary from -100‰ to -180‰. A common phenomenon of various oil and matured rock derived n-alkanes is a trend of increasing δD with chain length.
