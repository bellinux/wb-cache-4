5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Fiver's visions {{have promised}} them {{a safe place}} in which to settle, and the group {{eventually}} finds Watership Down, which matches Fiver's description of the perfect home exactly. There they are soon reunited with Holly and Bluebell, who were with Bigwig in the Owsla. The two are nursing severe injuries which, <b>they</b> <b>reveal,</b> were inflicted as they escaped the violent human destruction of Sandleford and then later at Cowslip's warren. Holly also confesses that it was he who had tried to stop them leaving that first night, but Fiver's vision coming true has left him a changed rabbit and he is there to join them in whatever way they will have him.|$|E

5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E
5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E

5|$|There are Han-era {{literary}} {{references to}} tall towers {{found in the}} capital cities; they often served as watchtowers, astronomical observatories, and religious establishments meant to attract the favor of immortals. The court eunuchs Zhao Zhong and Zhang Rang discouraged the aloof Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 CE) from ascending to the top floors of tall towers (claiming it would cause bad luck), in order to conceal from him the enormous palatial mansions the eunuchs built for themselves in Luoyang. It is not known for certain whether or not miniature ceramic models of residential towers and watchtowers found in Han-dynasty tombs are completely faithful representations of such timber towers, yet <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> vital clues about lost timber architecture.|$|E

Roddick and Millie go with them on their spacecraft to help them find a cure. They learn that Fellpool blood could be used to process a special, invisible material which could give them a massive advantage in the war. Upon coming in contact with Lezonians, <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> that they were being forced into war by a shadowy, powerful third party with a disgust for the Federation.|$|E
5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. <b>They</b> <b>reveal</b> that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. <b>They</b> <b>reveal</b> certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
5|$|Even after publication, the book's status {{remained}} vague {{because the}} king had not given his full support to it. In a draft letter, Henry noted {{that he had not}} read the book, but supported its printing. His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour and the birth of the male heir, Edward, that Henry had sought for so long. Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November. That month Henry started to work on the Bishops' Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment. Cranmer's responses to the king were far more confrontational than his colleagues' and he wrote at much greater length. <b>They</b> <b>reveal</b> unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or sola fide (faith alone) and predestination. However, his words did not convince the king. A new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King's Book.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet).

Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to see him and informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself. Will refuses to abandon his friend, and Uncle Tam formulates a plan for him to rescue Chester and to take him back to the surface.|$|E

When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, <b>they</b> <b>reveal</b> that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
