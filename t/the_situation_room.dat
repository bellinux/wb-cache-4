25|$|While Ventura has {{not held}} public office {{since the end}} of his term as {{governor}} in 2003, he has remained politically active and has occasionally hinted at intentions of possibly running again for political office. In an interview on CNN's <b>The</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> on April 7, 2008, Ventura said that he was considering entering the race for the United States Senate seat then held by Norm Coleman, his Republican opponent in the 1998 Gubernatorial race. A poll commissioned by Twin Cities station Fox 9 put him at 24 percent, behind Democratic candidate Al Franken at 32 percent and Norm Coleman at 39 percent in a hypothetical three-way race. However, Ventura announced on Larry King Live on July 14, 2008, that he would not run; Ventura's decision not to join the race was partly rooted from a fear of a potential lack of privacy for his family, a concern that contributed to his refusal to seek a second term as governor.

The following day, the Hollywoodinterrupted.com blog alleged that Comedy Central parent Viacom canceled the rebroadcast due to threats of Cruise to boycott the publicity tour of his upcoming film [...] These assertions were soon also reported by E!

Fox News attributed threats from Tom Cruise, stating, [...] "to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode", as evidence of [...] "bad blood" [...] between Cruise and Viacom (which also owns Paramount Pictures, the distributor of MI:III). CNN's <b>The</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> with Wolf Blitzer also cited [...] "industry sources" [...] who believed the episode was pulled [...] "because the network and Tom Cruise's current movie studio are both owned by the same corporation."

Kings' General Manager Dean Lombardi stated that the clock was correct and no extra time had been added due to the way the clock self-corrects at various times. Howson stated on the team's blog that [...] "It is an amazing coincidence that with the Kings on a power play at Staples Center and with a mad scramble around our net in the dying seconds of the third period of a 2–2 hockey game that the clock stopped for at least one full second," [...] adding that, [...] "Either there was a deliberate stopping of the clock or the clock malfunctioned."
