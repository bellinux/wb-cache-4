5|$|In the spring, {{when the}} water reaches , the turtle begins {{actively}} foraging. However, if <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> exceeds , the turtle will not feed. In fall, the turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.|$|E
5|$|The pH {{and calcium}} {{carbonate}} concentration have both {{increased in the}} upper reaches of Buffalo Creek since September 2009, as has <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> The phosphorus concentration at the point where Buffalo Flat Road passes over Buffalo Creek has increased by at least tenfold since September 2009.|$|E
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
30|$|<b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> {{showed a}} regular {{seasonal}} cycle (Fig.  6). <b>The</b> maximum <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> {{was recorded in}} February 2009 (29.70  ±  0.55  °C) and the minimum was in July 2008 (25.70  ±  0.46  °C). <b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> differed significantly among the sampling months (F 11, 96  =  89.545, p <  0.001). February 2009 had significantly <b>the</b> highest <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> of all <b>the</b> months (p <  0.05). On the other hand, July 2008 had significantly <b>the</b> lowest <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> of all <b>the</b> months (p <  0.05).|$|R
50|$|In a {{conventional}} boiler, fuel is burned {{and the hot}} gases produced pass through a heat exchanger where much of their heat is transferred to <b>water,</b> thus raising <b>the</b> <b>water's</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{concerns}} of outflow <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> {{and its effect}} on fish populations led to regular careful measurements of the lake's thermocline characteristics and <b>the</b> inlet <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> Concrete pier blocks were installed to minimize <b>the</b> effect of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> shock on downstream aquatic life.|$|R
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.|$|E
5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{along the}} river and stream sides also help regulate <b>the</b> <b>water’s</b> <b>temperature</b> during <b>the</b> long and hot summers. It also provides decaying leaves and plants that are an essential part {{to the survival of}} all organisms living in <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> mean <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> value (22.2  °C) in {{the present}} study was higher than the average value (16.7  °C) in Tinishu Akaki River, Ethiopia, {{reported}} by Samuel et al. (2007), but it was substantially lower than <b>the</b> mean <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> value (25.65  °C) in Upper Awash River, Ethiopia (Fasil et al. 2013).|$|R
5000|$|Achieving cooler temperatures: Tankless {{water heaters}} often have minimum flow {{requirements}} before the heater is activated, {{and this can}} result in a gap between <b>the</b> cold <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> and <b>the</b> coolest warm <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> that can be achieved with a hot and cold water mix.|$|R
5|$|This grebe eats mostly insects, of both {{adult and}} larval stages, {{as well as}} crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When {{moulting}} at lakes with high salinity, although, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The behaviour of black-necked grebes changes {{in response to the}} availability of brine shrimp; bodies of water with more shrimp have more grebes, and grebes spend more time foraging when the amount of shrimp and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change may}} well affect populations of seabirds in the {{northern}} Atlantic. The most important demographic may {{be an increase in}} the sea surface temperature which may have benefits for some northerly Atlantic puffin colonies. Breeding success depends on there being ample supplies of food at the time of maximum demand, as the chick grows. In northern Norway the main food item fed to the chick is the young herring. The success of the newly hatched fish larvae during the previous year was governed by <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> which controlled plankton abundance and this in turn influenced the growth and survival of the first-year herring. The breeding success of Atlantic puffin colonies has been found to correlate in this way with the water surface temperatures of the previous year.|$|E
5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after absorbing the subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} Clifton's 4 beaches involves <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> and annual denudation and re-deposit of the bay's sugar-white sands, although {{for the most}} part protected in the 'wind shadow' of Lion's Head mountain that stands behind Clifton (on its Eastern side).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> hatchery's <b>water</b> supply {{comes from}} Lake Cumberland {{at a depth}} ranging from 25 to 100 feet below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> will range from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 65 degrees Fahrenheit {{depending}} {{on the time of}} year. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> gravity flows through the hatchery at rates up to 15,000 gallons per minute.|$|R
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
25|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (between 4°C and 0°C {{in fresh}} water, {{approximately}} -1.9°C for normal salinity sea water), exposure suits are mandatory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> due {{to climate}} change can be {{estimated}} using the air temperature because <b>the</b> air and <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> are closely related and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{have been widely used}} as the indicators of the environmental and ecological changes. It is highly necessary to estimate the frequency distribution of <b>the</b> air and <b>water</b> <b>temperatures,</b> for <b>the</b> climate change derives the change of <b>the</b> coastal <b>water</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In this study, the distribution function of the air temperatures is estimated by using the long-term coastal air temperature data sets in Korea. The candidate distribution function is the bi-modal distribution function used in the previous studies, such as Cho et al. (2003) on tidal elevation data and Jeong et al. (2013) on <b>the</b> coastal <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> data. <b>The</b> parameters of the function are optimally estimated based on the least square method. It shows that the optimal parameters are highly correlated to the basic statistical informations, such as mean, standard deviation, and skewness coefficient. The RMS error of the parameter estimation using statistical information ranges is about 5 %. In addition, the bi-modal distribution fits good to the overall frequency pattern of the air temperature. However, it can be regarded as the limitations that the distribution shows some mismatch with the rapid decreasing pattern in the high-temperature region and the some small peaks...|$|R
25|$|Several {{hot springs}} {{are in the}} Vasai Taluka {{in the bed of}} the Tansa River. They are near Akloli, Ganeshpuri and Vajreshwari villages.

25|$|When a {{stratified}} {{hot water}} storage tank has closed <b>water</b> circuits, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> can be up to 90 to 95°C at the top and 20 to 40°C at the bottom.

25|$|For cold-water use, {{especially}} diving under ice, {{the user}} will usually wear a thick undersuit in a membrane dry suit.

25|$|Eel-tailed catfish spawn {{in spring}} and midsummer, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> {{increases}} to between 2024°C (6875°F. The nest is built about one or two weeks before spawning. They build large nests up to a metre in diameter with small stones and gravel, within which the eggs are laid. One parent, sometimes both, guard the eggs until they hatch.|$|E
25|$|Thermoclines, or sudden {{changes in}} {{temperature}}. Where the air temperature {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> shallow water may be warmed by {{the air and the}} sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} {{extensive}} {{investigation of the}} disappearance of the golden jellyfish medusae, Dawson et al. determined that the most likely cause was an El Niño weather event that raised <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> with the result that the symbiotic algae (Zooxanthellae) that live within the golden jellyfish medusae and the syphistomae (scyphozoan polyps) could not survive.|$|E
