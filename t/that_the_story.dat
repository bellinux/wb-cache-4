5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> itself was very effective.

Upon this volume's publication, Donald Wandrei, one of Arkham House's founders, wrote letters to reviewers complaining <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> were essentially Derleth's own works, incorporating fragments of unpublished Lovecraft prose. Gahan Wilson agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> [...] "should really be billed as his Derleth's own, and merely based on the notes and letters of Lovecraft, and on the Lovecraftian mythos as he Derleth saw it, {{and no more than}} that." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> had not developed enough {{even though it was}} only the first part.

5|$|Written by Philip Martin, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on 28 December 1983 and had the Doctor travel into the Egyptian underworld to save Peri. On 9 March 1984 Saward felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> idea needed further work {{before it could be}} considered for commissioning.|$|E
5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E
5|$|An EastEnders {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} programme-makers {{were working in}} close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims {{to raise awareness of}} real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. Sara Nathan of The Sun reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> had been planned since the previous year, and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony's release from prison and the effect it would have on her family.|$|E
5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was overloaded {{with too many}} elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Bhandarkar, who {{is known}} for {{studying}} his subject matter to make his films as realistic as possible, researched the fashion industry for nearly eight months, attending fashion events and shows. He spoke with designers, buyers, choreographers and models. Several media publications reported that the film was inspired by the lives of fashion models such as Shivani Kapur, Geetanjali Nagpal, Kate Moss and Alicia Raut; however, Bhandarkar stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is fictional and does not resemble anyone's life. The media also reported that the film revolved around two homosexual fashion designers; Bhandarkar denied these rumours, saying the film did not revolve around male characters but had female protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producers}} Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall {{and asked}} him to write a two-part episode involving Silurians and a drill. Moffat wished to redesign the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces. Being in the fourth production block of the series, the episode was filmed in October and November 2009, with location filming in Llanwynno, Wales. McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress, portraying Madame Vastra, another Silurian character. The episode was watched by 6.49million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised the horror, some noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was very simplistic, and critics disagreed about the redesigned Silurians.|$|E
5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Critics generally {{felt that the}} game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons cooperative campaign as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
