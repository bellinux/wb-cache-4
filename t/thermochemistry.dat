25|$|A {{particularly}} important objective, called computational <b>thermochemistry,</b> is to calculate thermochemical quantities {{such as the}} enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is {{generally considered to be}} 1kcal/mol or 4kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods.|$|E

25|$|More {{quantitative}} {{studies by}} James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, {{and helped to}} place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, {{was still trying to}} explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of the}} 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as <b>thermochemistry.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the 1870s, Josiah Willard Gibbs unified a large {{quantity}} of 19th century <b>thermochemistry</b> into one compact theory.

2500|$|Jobs for chemists usually require {{at least}} a bachelor's degree, but many positions, {{especially}} those in research, require a [...] Master of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD.).

At the Master's level and higher, students tend to specialize in a particular field. Fields of specialization include biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, quantum chemistry, environmental chemistry, and <b>thermochemistry.</b> Postdoctoral experience may be required for certain positions.|$|E
