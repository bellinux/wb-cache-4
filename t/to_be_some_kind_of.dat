25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E

500|$|According to Pattie Boyd's {{recollection}} in 2007, {{her marriage}} to George Harrison was already [...] "in trouble" [...] {{by the time he}} wrote his 1969 hit song [...] "Something", dedicated to her. Harrison and Boyd were married in January 1966, having met two years before on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night, but by 1968, his dedication to meditation and Eastern mysticism had begun to divide the couple. Boyd writes of an associated issue at this time: [...] "And there were other women... George was fascinated by the god Krishna who was always surrounded by young maidens. He came back from India [...] wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Krishna figure, a spiritual being with lots of concubines. He actually said so." ...|$|E

An MI6 agent reported that [...] "a concrete chamber was to be built near one of the tunnels for the installation of a tube, 40 to 50 metres long, which he referred to as a 'rocket launching cannon.

[...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ...

500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone.

2500|$|The {{course for}} the race was flat {{with a number of}} turns and was grassy and {{reasonably}} dry underfoot.

2500|$|In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, {{writing for}} Sports Illustrated, named Paige as the hardest thrower {{in the history}} of baseball.

Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige's fastball made his own look like a changeup." [...] Posnanski further noted that: for most of his career Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs. Nothing. Oh, he named them {{different}} names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable {{for the better part of}} 15 years. One pitch. It's a lot like Mariano Rivera, except he wasn't doing it for one inning at a time. He was pitching complete games day after day. That had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> incredible fastball.... perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard.

2500|$|FEMM's {{music has}} been {{described}} by several music critics and scholars as electronic dance music (EDM), with a variety of sub-elements including hip-hop, electronica, eurodance, and house music. According to Mike Kanert from Metropolis Magazine, he felt FEMM's music moved towards Americanized music, including hip-hop and club culture. A staff member from Arcadey.net commented that [...] "FEMM's music mostly consists of regurgitated American EDM, dance-pop, and hip-hop, all of which is just as enjoyable as it is generic. I'm guessing it's supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> meta commentary on mainstream music and manufactured pop stars or something...". FEMM's debut studio album Femm-Isation shows several elements of electronic dance music; Greg Hignight from Nekopop.com reviewed the album and noted they album's ability in sending J-Pop music and English language to convey messages to the Western audience; [...] "Each song is its own little pop universe. The album’s English lyrics also allow for an instant emotional connection with listeners, circumventing the language barrier that’s often been a challenge for J-Pop." [...] For FEMM's 2014 pop ballad [...] "Unbreakable", the entire production relied on live orchestral instruments and was considered a [...] "versatile" [...] move by both fans and critics; According to W-Trouble, the song [...] "relies on human feelings rather than of a mannequin."

2500|$|UNIT's {{status is}} {{supported}} by enabling legislation that allows it to assume emergency powers when necessary. Although it operates {{under the authority of}} the United Nations, its members are seconded from the host country's military and are still bound to obey that chain of command. Ranks, within the UK section of UNIT at least, thus mirror those in the British Army — Lethbridge-Stewart is a Brigadier, Yates is a Captain, a Major appears in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] (2005), and a Colonel and Captain appear in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem"/"The Poison Sky" [...] (2008). UNIT personnel are seconded from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force, and are still bound by the UK chain of command, and the commander reports to the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence through Department C-19. However, if the commander feels it appropriate and necessary, the commander can request that Geneva overrule the national government. Lethbridge-Stewart, for example, reports to the Ministry of Defence and the Prime Minister, and Major Blake reports to the Prime Minister in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". UNIT is able to call on the conventional military branches for support, such as the RAF for precision air-strikes. Due to the international nature of the organisation, it is sometimes viewed with suspicion by local military and national security agencies, who feel that it might impinge on their sovereignty. UNIT's existence is known to the public, but mainly as a security organisation with scientific expertise; its actual agenda is classified, some believing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> covert counter-terrorist unit. Although the Brigadier originally states that UNIT do not arrest people, as of the 21st century, UNIT has the authority to detain persons indefinitely without trial, appeal, outside contact or legal representation, as experienced by Toshiko Sato before she was recruited to work for the British government by the Torchwood Institute in a flashback in the Torchwood episode [...] "Fragments" [...] (2008). The organisation was rearranged by Kate Stewart, the daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. In [...] "The Power of Three" [...] (2012), Kate heads UNIT's scientific research department, which now has authority over the military branch.|$|E
