5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Hazards {{magazine}} {{reported that}} workers in various industries were taking to wearing diapers because their bosses denied them toilet breaks during working hours. One woman said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> to spend 10% of her pay on incontinence pads for this reason.|$|E
25|$|Despite her situation, Marie {{wrote letters}} to her school friends pretending <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a happy {{domestic}} life. She also tried to help her husband by writing letters of recommendation for Charles to Paris, where he hoped to raise money. Before he left on a business trip, in December 1839, she made a will bequeathing to her husband her entire inheritance, {{with the proviso that}} he would do the same for her. This he did, but without her knowledge, he made another will soon after, leaving the Le Glandier property to his mother instead.|$|E

25|$|As he rose {{to power}} {{as leader of the}} Nazi Party, Hitler was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping a tight rein on her. When he {{discovered}} in December 1927 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his personal service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.|$|E
25|$|Hedgepeth left Rosario there {{briefly and}} {{returned}} around 11:30, {{after which they}} returned to their apartment together, arriving there around midnight. A half-hour later they left again, heading for Thrill, a nightclub in downtown Chapel Hill which admitted customers under the legal drinking age of 21 to dance. The two young women arrived at Thrill around 12:40 a.m. After almost {{an hour and a}} half of dancing, Rosario told police later <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an upset stomach and wanted to leave. Security cameras at the club show she and Hedgepeth leaving at 2:06 a.m.; it is the last visual record of her presence anywhere before the killing.|$|E
25|$|After Sheila's birth, Theresa began {{drinking}} heavily. She regularly drank at {{the local}} American Legion Hall where she met Estelle Lee Thornsberry, a disabled United States Army veteran. The two began a relationship and eventually moved in together. During the relationship, Theresa would routinely leave her children with Thornsberry while she went out drinking. Thornsberry began to question Theresa when she stayed out {{for days at a}} time and ended the relationship a few months later after he discovered <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an affair with his best friend. Shortly after the relationship with Thornsberry ended, Theresa met and began a relationship with a United States Marine private named Robert Knorr. She soon became pregnant and the couple married on July 9, 1966.|$|E

25|$|After {{a decade}} in American films, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli (1950), {{following}} the revelation <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage with Rossellini created a scandal in the US that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, after which she made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in Anastasia (1956), for which she won her second Academy Award but which was entirely filmed in Britain and Europe. Although she made many films for Hollywood studios in subsequent years, they were all made in Europe {{and she did not}} actually film in Hollywood again until 1969. Many of her personal and film documents {{can be seen in the}} Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.|$|E
25|$|Williams was the {{defending}} champion {{and one of the}} favorites to win the singles title at Wimbledon. However, she lost in the third round to 26th-seeded Jelena Janković. After the loss, Williams said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> pain in her left wrist, although she admitted that the injury was not the cause of her loss. Williams did not play in the US Open series or the US Open itself due to the wrist injury. In October, during her first tournament in almost three months, she reinjured her wrist at the tournament in Luxembourg and lost in the second round to qualifier Agnieszka Radwańska. Williams finished the season as world No. 46, her lowest finish since she began to play on the WTA Tour full-time in 1997. It was the second consecutive year she finished higher than Serena, who finished the year at world No. 95.|$|E
25|$|Adelaide attempted, perhaps unsuccessfully, to {{influence}} the King politically. She never spoke about politics in public; however, she was strongly Tory. It is unclear how much of William's attitudes during {{the passage of the}} Reform Act 1832 were due to her influence. The Press, the public and courtiers assumed that she was agitating behind the scenes against reform, but she was careful to be non-committal in public. As a result of her partiality, she became unpopular with reformers. Unbelievable rumours circulated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an affair with her Lord Chamberlain, the Tory Lord Howe, but almost everyone at court knew that Adelaide was inflexibly pious and was always faithful to her husband. The Whig Prime Minister, Lord Grey, had Lord Howe removed from Adelaide's household. Attempts to reinstate him after the Reform Bill had passed were not successful, as Lord Grey and Lord Howe could not come to an agreement as to how independent Howe could be of the government.|$|E

500|$|TV Guide {{introduced}} Angelina as: [...] "the Jersey girl {{daughter of}} mob boss Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr). She comes to Genoa City with dreams {{of being a}} chart-topping vocalist. And what Angelina wants, Angelina gets!" [...] Fred Bronson of The Hollywood Reporter noted that DeGarmo already had experience of playing {{the part of a}} [...] "Jersey Girl" [...] because she had once starred in the musical The Toxic Avenger, which is set in New Jersey. Bronson also noted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a fun time playing the part. Describing Angelina, DeGarmo labeled her as [...] "over-the-top" [...] and a [...] "gum-smacking, tone-deaf princess whose hair is as large as her attitude." [...] She said [...] "I'm having a blast! Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion." [...] The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a [...] "blast" [...] picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: [...] "Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake" [...] she stated. Additionally, she noted that [...] "Angelina’s style has taken a few notes from the cast of Jersey Shore." [...] Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: [...] "There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid." [...] She is also described as a [...] "mafia princess". DeGarmo said: [...] "You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone on their toes. One minute she's nice, the next she snaps". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: [...] "she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. She loves the perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it." [...] Also, her character was probably based off of Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, Manning became pregnant; {{the couple}} were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, {{becoming}} less critical of others, including her own mother, {{with whom she had}} long had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, she rested, walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month, however, the baby died in utero, and as was the practice at the time, Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. [...] "I am like a walking cemetery", she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Reggie would be assassinated. Reggie decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a nervous breakdown, and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month's holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this [...] "strange and difficult woman", and Reggie's [...] "wonderfully patient" [...] behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss, and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats.|$|E
500|$|Her second collection, The Rosary (or Beads – Chetki) {{appeared}} in March 1914 and firmly established her {{as one of}} the most popular and sought after poets of the day. Thousands of women composed poems [...] "in honour of Akhmatova", mimicking her style and prompting Akhmatova to exclaim: [...] "I taught our women how to speak, but don't know how to make them silent". Her aristocratic manners and artistic integrity won her the titles [...] "Queen of the Neva" [...] and [...] "Soul of the Silver Age," [...] as the period came to be known in the history of Russian poetry. [...] In Poem Without a Hero, the longest and one of the best known of her works, written many decades later, she would recall this as a blessed time of her life. [...] She became close friends with Boris Pasternak (who, though married, proposed to her many times) [...] and rumours began to circulate <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> an affair with influential lyrical poet Alexander Blok. In July 1914, Akhmatova wrote “Frightening times are approaching/ Soon fresh graves will cover the land"; [...] on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia, marking the start of [...] "the dark storm" [...] of world war, civil war, revolution and totalitarian repression for Russia. The Silver Age came to a close.|$|E

500|$|The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and {{the parish}} had some {{difficulty}} {{in finding a}} replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter {{in a room with}} no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed. On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by [...] "something horrible". Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; {{in the middle of the}} first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the Daily Mirror, these incidents attracted the attention of several psychic researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> a sexual relationship with the lodger, Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons. The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.|$|E

Dragun initially told her mother that she was optimistic about the switch, but after less than three weeks, she told her mother over the phone <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> thoughts of suicide and that she felt [...] "worthless." [...] Dragun died by suicide a few days later.|$|E

She did another celebrity boxing match, on The Man Show, and won against co-host Doug Stanhope.

[...] Meanwhile, Empress Dowager He was having her ladies in waiting Aqiu (阿秋) and Aqian (阿虔) passing messages between her and Jiang, begging him to have her life and that of the young emperor spared when the transition would occur. [...] This led to Wang Yin (王殷) and Zhao Yinheng falsely accusing Jiang being in a conspiracy with the empress dowager to restore Tang imperial power. [...] In late 905, Zhu had Jiang and Liu put to death and replaced Jiang with Wang and Zhao. [...] Wang and Zhao then accused Empress Dowager He of having carried on an affair with Jiang. [...] Zhu had them put the empress dowager to death by strangulation, with Aqiu and Aqian beaten to death, and had Emperor Ai issue an edict claiming <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> affair with Jiang and committed suicide to offer alopogy, posthumously demoting her to commoner status.|$|E
