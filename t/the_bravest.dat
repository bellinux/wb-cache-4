5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing, Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among <b>the</b> <b>bravest</b> of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{two-thirds of}} the Shahnameh {{is devoted to the}} age of heroes, {{extending}} from Manuchehr's reign until the conquest of Alexander the Great (Eskandar). The main feature of this period is the major role played by the Saka or Sistānī heroes who appear as the backbone of the Persian Empire. Garshāsp is briefly mentioned with his son Narimān, whose own son Sām acted as the leading paladin of Manuchehr while reigning in Sistān in his own right.

Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield), intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.|$|E
25|$|Datames {{appears to}} have {{obtained}} the highest reputation in his day for courage and ability in war, which caused his fame to extend even among the Greeks, {{though he did not}} come into personal collision with them. Cornelius Nepos (to whose biographical sketch we owe the only connected narrative of his life) calls him <b>the</b> <b>bravest</b> and most able of all non-Greek and non-Roman generals, except Hamilcar and Hannibal; but there is much confusion in the accounts transmitted to us, {{and it is difficult to}} assign the anecdotes of him recorded by Polyaenus to their proper place in his history. The chronology of the events related by Nepos is also very obscure; but according to that author and Diodorus it would appear that Datames must have died before Artaxerxes, probably 362 BC.|$|E

25|$|Final Fantasy All <b>the</b> <b>Bravest</b> {{features}} the player controlling {{a party of}} characters, and controlling them to fight an opposing enemy party of characters. Characters traverse an overhead map between battles, and engage {{in a series of}} battles culminating in a boss fight. Player parties can hold up to 40 characters. The game {{features the}} Active Time Battle (ATB) system. In this system, battles are turn-based, with turns being taken when the gradually increasing ATB gauge reaches its capacity. Upon attacking, the bar is emptied and gradually starts refilling again. Defeating enemies grants experience points the player needs to level up and in turn gain character slots to use for the player's party. When weaponry is found, it's auto equipped to all characters that can wield it. Once every three hours, the Fever option is made available, granting the player the ability to attack without needing the ATB gauge to be refilled.|$|E
25|$|Weapons, battle {{formations}} and deployment. As noted previously, Kongo region battle formations were {{in relatively}} open order. This allowed the peculiar dodging, twisting and leaping noted in Portuguese accounts as warriors {{tried to avoid}} arrows and spears delivered by their opponents. A battle generally opened with a brief volley of arrows from relatively weak bows. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>bravest</b> soldiers went into battle {{with only a few}} arrows, which were poisoned in some cases by a potent mixture called cabanzo. Once these were released, the contenders closed for a decision by hand-to-hand combat. Several thousand men could take place in these set-piece battles, and the affair was usually decided by superior skill and aggression. Basic formations were known, and three divisions were sometimes used- a center and two wings. A complex system of drums, horns and signals aided in maneuver of the warrior hosts, and distinctive battle-flags and pennants identified the location of elite troops or their commanders. See the Battle of Mbwila for a detailed example of a Kongo army in action, including the 3-part division of the host, and its use of reserves.|$|E
25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly <b>the</b> <b>bravest</b> gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E

25|$|The Sarmatians had a near-religious {{fondness for}} their swords: tribal worship was {{directed}} at a sword sticking up from the ground, similar to the sword in the stone. They carried standards {{in the form of}} dragons. Ossetian Nart sagas contain a number of interesting parallels to the Arthurian legends. First, the life of the Nart warrior (batraz) is tied to his sword, which must be thrown into the sea at his death. When one wounded Batraz asks his last surviving comrade to do the task for him, his companion tries to fool him twice before finally hurling the weapon into the sea; rather like Arthur's wondrous sword Excalibur which had to be returned to the Lady of the Lake at his death by his last surviving knight, Bedivere, who only did the deed on his third trip to the lake. The Nart heroes Soslan and Sosryko, collect the beards of vanquished enemies to trim their cloaks like Arthur's enemy Rience: the subjects of both stories have one last beard to obtain before the cloak is complete. Two other similar motifs are the Cup of the Narts (Nartyamonga), which appeared at feasts, delivered to each person what he liked best to eat, and which was kept by <b>the</b> <b>bravest</b> of the Narts ('Knights') - somewhat similar to the Holy Grail connected to the Arthurian cycle – and the magical woman, dressed in white, associated with water, who helps the hero acquire his sword – similar to the Lady of the Lake.|$|E
