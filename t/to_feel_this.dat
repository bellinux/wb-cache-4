5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for a patient <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> way about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
25|$|Originally, WXP {{planned for}} The Fellowship {{to be an}} RPG, but they soon came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> might {{alienate}} potential players, and as they wanted to attract {{as many people as}} possible to the title, including people who had never read the books, they decided to develop the game as a third-person action-adventure instead. At the time, Frodo was the only controllable character, with the other members of the fellowship featuring as NPCs, although the player was to have the choice as to which character(s) to fight alongside at each point in the game. The developers were also working closely with Tolkien Enterprises to ensure any action sequences or enemies that moved beyond the immediate events of the novel kept with the general tone of the narrative and were true to the spirit of Tolkien's legendarium.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. <b>To</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E

Your mama has <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> record, your daddy has <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> record, {{everybody}} has <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it}} would have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with {{the sense that he}} felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing this out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E

2500|$|Madetoja {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> way {{throughout his}} life. A decade later, {{he sought to}} defend Sibelius against the (growing) conventional wisdom {{that he was a}} poor teacher around whom no appreciable school of thought had formed (unlike, for example, Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School). In Aulos, a volume published on the occasion of Sibelius's sixtieth birthday in 1925, Madetoja argued for a more nuanced, less [...] "superficial" [...] definition of the word 'teacher' and recounted with fondness his personal experiences as one of Sibelius's pupils.|$|E
2500|$|At each concert, Brooks {{and crew}} {{return to the}} stage and perform [...] "The Fever". Brooks dances on a {{conveyor}} belt as the drummer's sphere rises above the stage. Following the performance, the band leaves the stage once again. Brooks then returns, often unaccompanied, for what he dubs the [...] "housekeeping segment", in which he scans the crowd for fans with signs requesting songs, performing them acoustically. In some instances (such as the Atlanta concerts in September 2014), he may also perform acoustic covers of songs like [...] "Amarillo By Morning", [...] "Night Moves", and [...] "Piano Man". Regardless, the encore set commonly concludes with the band returning to perform [...] "Much Too Young (<b>To</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>This</b> Damn Old)".|$|E
60|$|I {{gazed at}} him with unmixed admiration. He was squarer, sterner, and in every way smarter and more {{remarkable}} than ever.

2500|$|Despite {{offers from}} various record labels, LeDoux {{refused to sign}} a {{recording}} contract, instead choosing to retain his independence and control over his work while enjoying his regional following. [...] In 1989, however, he shot to national prominence when he was mentioned in the debut song of Garth Brooks' Top 10 country hit [...] "Much Too Young (<b>To</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>This</b> Damn Old)." [...] Capitalizing on the sudden attention, LeDoux {{signed a contract with}} Capitol Records subsidiary Liberty Records and released his first national album, Western Underground, in 1991. His follow-up album, Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy, was certified gold and reached the Top 10. The title track, a duet with Brooks, became LeDoux's first and only Top 10 country single, reaching No. 7 in 1992. In concert, he ended the song by saying, [...] "Thanks, Garth!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to viewer {{concern about the}} direction the writers seemed to be taking Todd and Marty's bond, Carlivati assured Soap Opera Digest {{that he would have}} never written this under different circumstances. [...] "We're not talking about Marty with all her memories. She would never get close to Todd in any way," [...] he said. [...] "This is about a Marty who doesn't remember anything about him, and he starts to feel close to this new person and starts <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> gratitude for the fact that she doesn't remember this horrible thing he did." [...] Carlivati added, [...] "It is like this new chapter and this new arc. I don't think I would ever attempt to tell this relationship the way we're telling it if she knew who she was." [...] He said, [...] "I think that's a much different scenario. If we had Marty just come back to town and we started to build a relationship between the two of them...I can't imagine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Law again {{wrote to}} Strachey {{saying that he}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> policy was the correct one, and only regretted that the issue was splitting the party {{at a time when}} unity was needed to fight the Home Rule problem. At the meeting of the Lancashire party the group under Derby condemned Law's actions and called for a three-week party recess before deciding {{what to do about the}} repeal of the Referendum Pledge. This was an obvious ultimatum to Law, giving him a three-week period to change his mind. Law believed that Derby was [...] "unprincipled and treacherous", particularly since he then circulated a questionnaire among Lancashire party members with leading questions such as [...] "do you think the abandonment of the referendum will do harm?" [...] Law met the Lancashire party on 2 January 1913 and ordered that they must replace any food tariff based resolutions with a vote of confidence in him as a leader, and that any alternative would result in his resignation.|$|E

2500|$|On his 13th birthday, Osbourne {{got drunk}} {{for the first}} time on whisky; by the time he was 14, he was {{drinking}} regularly and had started smoking marijuana. He started partying heavily, and made headlines on 21 April 2003 when he was admitted to a child psychiatric ward for an addiction to OxyContin. Osbourne's drug addiction escalated after his mother was diagnosed with cancer; he was as well battling with his own depression. His self-destructive behaviour came to a head when he attempted suicide by taking a cocktail of prescription pills and cutting his hands with shards of glass after hearing his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend pick up her phone when he called her. He woke up 12 hours later. Osbourne continued with his drug use until he realised that he [...] "never wants <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> way ever again" [...] and admitted himself into an adolescent psychiatric ward. He spent 10 days detoxing and was moved to an adolescent rehabilitation centre in Malibu, where he enrolled in a recovery programme.|$|E
