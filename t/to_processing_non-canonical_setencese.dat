40|$|Post-transcriptional, RNA-based {{regulation}} {{is a major}} contributor to alterations in gene expression, and γ-herpesviruses interface with the host RNA targeting machinery in a variety of ways. Several of these interactions involve coordination with cellular ribonucleases, for example <b>to</b> direct <b>non-canonical</b> <b>processing</b> of viral microRNAs or widespread degradation of cellular messenger RNAs. Conversely, select viral transcripts use both cis-acting and trans-acting mechanisms to evade degradation. The diversity of mechanisms used by these viruses to both engage and escape the cellular RNA decay machinery underscores the influence these pathways exert on cellular and viral gene expression. Further research in this field should help reveal new mechanisms of RNA-based regulation in both infected and uninfected cells. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{insights}} into a possible role of microRNAs in myeloproliferative neoplasms, we performed short RNAs massive sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analysis in the JAK 2 V 617 F mutated SET 2 cell line. Overall, 652 known mature miRNAs were detected, of which 21 were highly expressed, thus being responsible of most of miRNA-mediated gene repression. microRNA putative targets were enriched in specific signaling pathways, providing information about cell activities under massive post-transcriptional regulation. The majority of miRNAs were mixtures of sequence variants, called isomiRs, mainly due <b>to</b> alternative, <b>non-canonical</b> <b>processing</b> of hairpin precursors. We also identified 78 novel miRNAs (miRNA*) derived from known hairpin precursors. Both major and minor (*) form of miRNAs were expressed concurrently from half of expressed hairpins, highlighting the relevance of miRNA* and the complexity of strand selection bias regulation. Finally, we discovered that SET 2 cells express a number of miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs), short RNAs derived from genomic regions flanking mature miRNAs. We provide novel data about the possible origin of moRNAs, while their functional role remains to be elucidated. Overall, this study {{shed light on the}} complexity of microRNA-mediated gene regulation in SET 2 cells and represents the basis for future studies in JAK 2 V 617 F mutated cellular models...|$|R

In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated that the <b>processing</b> of <b>non-canonical</b> word orders could be more challenging for older adults. As optional structures with non-canonical word orders in Chinese, SOV and OSV might be subject to age-related changes. However, little work has been done to investigate whether the use or perception of SOV and OSV could change with age. By comparing the acceptability in the younger adults and the older adults, we were able to detect the possible differences in their subjective perception of the well-formedness of these word orders.|$|R

In the Czech Republic, shipments of broilers <b>to</b> <b>processing</b> plants were monitored from 1997 to 2004. It was found that the mortality of broilers during transport was 0. 247 %, but it varied according to the transport distance <b>to</b> the <b>processing</b> plant from 0. 146 % (50 km maximum) to 0. 862 % (> 300 km).
