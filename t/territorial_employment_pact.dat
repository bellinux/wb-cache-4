The paper {{deals with}} the issue of Territorial Employment Pacts as a tool of {{horizontal}} non-hierarchical Europeanization in the field of social policy. The authors examine the functioning of these pacts in Austria, and understand them as an example of political learning, experience and policy transfer that is suitable for designing Territorial Employment pacts in the Czech republic. Subsequently, the implementation of a <b>Territorial</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Pact</b> in the Moravian-Silesian Region is discussed from the perspective of policy learning processes as well as mechanisms of horizontal Europeanization...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{more recent}} approaches in regional employment policy which {{are intended to}} promote innovation and cooperation. The {{point of departure for}} the paper is the insufficient growth in the Federal Republic of Germany, which is attributed among other things to a lack of innovation. First of all the question is asked as to what economic theory says, in particular neo-classicism and the regional theory on the origin of dynamicinnovative environments. It is brought out that state interventions in market processes are justified if they are limited as regards time, become established after a certain time and start out from the flow of information between the players. A creative regional environment is characterised by measures that are responsible for a positive innovation climate. Policy can support innovative regional environments by participating in a network itself or by creating the communication structure for such a network. On the basis of the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Pacts</b> (Territoriale Beschäftigungspakte) and the InnoRegio Project the paper examines how the state can build up such regional cooperation structures and what different forms of cooperation and networks can develop. Practice shows that quite different partners covering a large range of subjects work together in regional development partnerships; the projects that a regional network produces are accordingly diverse. The key requirements for the success of regional alliances are a cooperative climate in the region and a common basic attitude to solving the employment problems together. A critical appreciation of these new ways of promoting employment rounds off the paper. " (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en)) Beschäftigungspolitik, Regionalpolitik, regionales Netzwerk...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s the European Commission {{launched}} an initiative called “Territorial <b>Employment</b> <b>Pacts</b> ” (TEPs). TEPs are contractual alliances between protagonists from various sectors on local level {{in order to}} develop innovative measures for job creation and job protection in their area. This initiative therefore leads to the emergence of regional policy networks. These policy networks can be characterized as stable but only on a low level formalized communication and cooperation networks between governmental and non-governmental actors, involved in a political process. In the province of Styria (Austria) there were built up six TEPs on regional level and a research project was set up to evaluate their performance and to ensure their future development. This evaluation strongly focussed on the analysis of the policy networks themselves by using the method of Social Network Analysis (SNA). This paper sums up the results of this research project. On the one hand we are going to discuss our experiences in evaluating policy networks in labor market policy using the instrument of SNA in the field of the Styrian TEPs. We are going to unfold our research design and its features developed for initiating policy learning among the pact protagonists. On the other hand we are going to focus on a more methodologic question: Is SNA an appropriate tool for evaluating policy networks in general? We will try to outline a possible answer by deriving abilities as well as constraints of the method based upon experiences from the TEP evaluation. Our aim is to offer general thoughts on this topic and not a detailed universal statistical or explanatory model of policy networks. 1 <b>Territorial</b> <b>employment</b> <b>pacts</b> (TEPs) For over 20 years Europe has had to face certain labour-market problems that seem to be intractable toward national measures which had been set up to defeat them.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{substantiate}} the need for eliminating the excessive spatial polarization of territorial socio-economic development as a necessary condition for advanced development of human resources potential. The authors explore the basic problems and contradictions of modern regional and local labor markets in Russia. Based on generalization and systematization of foreign and domestic research outcomes, the paper reveals the main condition for eliminating the territorial polarization threats, which implies formation of a new institutional environment in order to provide co-operation of participants in the territorial interest zone in personnel training and new jobs creating. The research findings demonstrate the increased disproportions between the workforce and labor markets of municipal formations in Sverdlovsk region, and emphasize the need for territorial industrial educational clusters maximizing the network co-operation of the involved parties. The scientific novelty combines adaptation of theoretical concepts of the “new economic geography” applied to reorganization processes in the Russian economy; and elaboration of the cluster model of advanced development of territorial human resources potential by means of territorial centers coordinating the interests of administration, business society, and households.

30|$|In Southern Europe the {{hierarchical}} layering of agreements {{based on the}} favourability principle has usually found strict legal application (Sciarra 2006). However, under heavy international pressure, recent legal changes have opened Pandora’s box. In Italy lowering sectorally agreed pay norms had been possible from 2001 in some ‘underdeveloped’ regions with high unemployment {{if there is a}} tripartite <b>employment</b> <b>pact.</b> The tripartite national pact of 2009, without approval of the largest union confederation, conceded the possibility to suspend the sectoral wage increase in firms that had fallen on hard times. In 2010 Fiat tested the pact by a round of concession bargaining including radical changes in working practices and dismissal protection in two of its plants, on threat of closure and relocation. Workers voted in favour in ballots organized by the company and the two plants were removed from the sector agreement. Soon after Fiat withdrew from the sector agreement. In June 2011 a new central agreement, with the signature of all three union confederations, stipulated that enterprise agreements can introduce temporary and experimental modifications of provisions in sector agreements within established limits and with approval by a majority of union delegates at the local level. These new rules have been applied in a few industry agreements since. When in August 2011 the government introduced, under pressure of the ECB, a decree-law with the possibility of derogation, by collective agreement, from legally-established dismissal protection guarantees, the main employers’ confederation could only rescue the central agreement it had just signed by promising not to use the new law.

Not a Hispano identity, an Anglo identity, or an affluent one, this gendered identity embodied {{a representation of the}} man territorial authorities defined as the ideal New Mexican, an image deemed necessary to merit and achieve equal inclusion in the United States. I argue that New Mexico's underfunded institutions of the Territorial Penitentiary, Mounted Police Force, Bureau of Immigration, and territorial courts [...] institutions designed to facilitate New Mexico's transition from a demeaned site of Spanish, Mexican, and indigenous Pueblo authority to a celebrated site of U.

This dissertation interrogates how and why territorial institutions differentially recognized those with whom they interacted, directly or tangentially, including immigrant miners, an incarcerated pregnant African American teenager and her veteran father, an elderly Anglo female murder victim, imprisoned Hispano husbands, Hispana business owners in need of police protection, and young Anglo "cowmen" seeking employment. New Mexico's status as a peripheral participant in the nation propelled a milieu of unbelonging and rigorous racialization. Scrutinizing demands for entitlements found in the correspondence, advertisements, and judicial proceedings of territorial institutions illuminates a gendered rhetorical pattern that determined whose labor would be considered most valuable, whose testimony would be granted the most consideration in court, whose family would merit wages from <b>territorial</b> <b>employment,</b> and whose presence would be most welcome outside of the penitentiary. New Mexico's territorial institutions are spaces where the enmeshment of race, gender, working-class masculinity, and political disenfranchisement is highly visible.

How women [...] whether Hispana, Anglo, African American, immigrant, native-born, young, elderly, domestic worker, or business owner [...] negotiated this space in political transition challenges the ubiquitous performances of masculinity harnessed to obtain privileges from territorial institutions...|$|R

In addition, I discuss the implications for employers and employees of flexible working time, and the lessons the German experience with flexible working time has for the United States.
