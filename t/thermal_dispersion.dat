5000|$|The {{operation}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> mass flow meters {{is attributed to}} L.V. King who, in 1914, published his famous King's Law revealing how a heated wire immersed in a fluid flow measures the mass velocity {{at a point in}} the flow. King called his instrument a [...] "hot-wire anemometer". However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s and 1970s that industrial-grade <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> mass flow meters finally emerged.|$|E

FCI has two divisions, one serving customers with measurement needs in industrial process and plant applications and an aerospace division, which produces sensors for aircraft manufacturers. FCI was a pioneer in developing <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> technology and holds numerous design and technology patents for its application in flow and level measurement.|$|E

30|$|Processes {{affecting}} {{recovery efficiency}} were detailed by Doughty et al. (1982). These include <b>thermal</b> conduction, <b>dispersion,</b> regional groundwater flow and {{the properties of}} the reservoir. Recently, much emphasis has been put on evaluating the effect of density-driven flow or buoyancy flow on recovery (Drijver et al. 2012; Schout et al. 2014). These factors should be kept in mind when evaluating results.|$|R
40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} cosmological N-body simulations, {{we study}} how the density profiles {{of dark matter}} halos {{are affected by the}} filtering of the density power spectrum below a given scale length and by the introduction of a <b>thermal</b> velocity <b>dispersion.</b> In the warm dark matter (WDM) scenario, both the free-streaming scale, Rf, and the velocity dispersion, vw th, are determined by the mass mW of the WDM particle. We found that vw th is too small to affect the density profiles of WDM halos. Down to the resolution attained in our simulations (∼ 0. 01 virial radii), there is not any significant difference in the density profiles and concentrations of halos obtained in simulations with and without the inclusion of vw th. Resolved soft cores appear only when we increase artificially the <b>thermal</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> to a value which is much higher than vw th. We show that the size of soft cores in a monolithic collapse is related to the tangential velocity dispersion. The density profiles of the studied halos with masses down to ∼ 0. 01 the filtering mass Mf can be described by the Navarro-Frenk-White shape; soft core...|$|R

50|$|Both types measure fluid {{mass flow}} rate {{by means of the}} heat convected from a heated surface to the flowing fluid. In the case of the <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> or immersible, type of flow meter, the heat is {{transferred}} to the boundary layer of the fluid flowing over the heated surface. In the case of the capillary-tube type, the heat is transferred to the bulk of the fluid flowing through a small heated capillary tube. The principles of operation of the two types are both thermal in nature, but are so substantially different that two separate standards are required. Additionally, their applications are much different. <b>Thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> flow meters are commonly used for general industrial gas flow applications in pipes and ducts, whereas capillary types are primarily used for smaller flows of clean gases or liquids in tubes. This type is most widely used for thermal mass flow meters in industry. Nevertheless, the capillary type is not the subject of this discussion.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{mass flow}} meter (also called <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> or thermal {{displacement}} flowmeter) technology is used for compressed air, nitrogen, helium, argon, oxygen, and natural gas. In fact, most gases can be measured {{as long as they}} are fairly clean and non-corrosive. For more aggressive gases, the meter may be made out of special alloys (e.g. Hastelloy), and pre-drying the gas also helps to minimize corrosion.|$|E
40|$|Data {{provided}} by Italian Ministry of Environment {{say that in}} 5 years you consume, just for heating of an apartment, an amount of energy equal to that required for the all construction of the same apartment. The years come down to three if one includes other energy consumption. In terms of primary energy, the building-plant system is responsible for about 45 % of the national energy demand. The rolling-shutter box system, in most cases, is the first responsible for <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersions</b> and input of free heat coming from outside. In addition, the window frames have the obligation of the CE marking to be sold on the free European market. Among the basic requirements, the thermal transmittance is the parameter responsible for the energy performance. The research concerned the energy study of different window frames and rolling-shutter boxes {{through the use of}} finite element methodology and experiments in situ. This study was carried out on six different types of windows frames (PVC, wood, and wood-aluminium) and four different models of rolling shutters-boxes (all with structure made by expanded polystyrene). The experimental analysis allowed the comparison between the thermal transmittance values calculated according to the UNI EN ISO 10077 - 1 / 2 and measured in accordance with ISO 9869...|$|R
40|$|The last Century {{witnessed}} {{an increasing}} awareness about energy efficiency {{in the construction}} sector, seen as the only possible solution to smooth {{the negative effects of}} buildings on the environment. Therefore energy efficient design and envelope innovation have been pushed, decreasing the <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersions</b> through enclosures and minimizing flows exchange. The adiabatic concept of dwellings, however, brings to a criticism: increasing internal gains and the risk of overheating, especially in warm climate. The analysis proposed aims to understand the robustness of the design choices in the Mediterranean climate, defining the resilience associated to different architectural and technical solutions. A model of Active house is taken as case-study and different technological scenarios are created. The results are compared both on the energy needs and the indoor thermal comfort provided. The results show that, to increase the resilience of buildings in Mediterranean climates, it is important to act on the exchange flows with the outdoor, integrate a proper shading system (or closing the south façade and opening the northern one) and avoid over insulated skins, which easily bring to overheating. This work shows the importance of coupling comfort and energy consumption in buildings performances evaluation to achieve a reliable and robust design.

40|$|Accounting {{for nearly}} 40 % final energy consumption, {{buildings}} {{are central to}} European energy policy. The Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings establishes a benchmarking system known as cost-optimality to set minimum energy performance requirements in new and existing buildings. This paper applies the cost-optimal methodology to an existing structure located in the Mediterranean area (Southern Italy). The building is composed of two units that have been considered for different uses: hotel and multi residential. Several energy efficiency and renewable measures have been implemented both individually {{and as part of}} packages of measures. The cost-optimal solution has been identified as able to balance energy consumption and costs from financial and macroeconomic perspectives. In comparison with the reference buildings, the cost-optimal solution decreases primary energy up of 90 % and CO 2 emissions up to 87 % at the lowest cost. <b>Thermal</b> <b>dispersions</b> through the envelope can be limited using a suitable combination of insulating materials while a variety of technical variants are selected, such as VRF (variant refrigerant flow) systems, heat pumps with fan coils associated with controlled mechanical ventilation, solar thermal and photovoltaic. This paper illustrates how the development of cost-optimal retrofit projects. It shows the most suitable efficiency measures for a building having two different uses and provides guidance for similar case studies related to a warm climate. JRC.

50|$|Thermal {{mass flow}} meters, {{also known as}} <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> or immersible mass flow meters {{comprise}} a family of instruments for the measurement of the total mass flow rate of a fluid, primarily gases, flowing through closed conduits. A second type is the capillary-tube type of {{thermal mass flow meter}}. Many mass flow controllers (MFC) which combine a mass flow meter, electronics and a valve are based on this design. Furthermore, a thermal mass flow meter can be built by measuring temperature differential across a silicon-based MEMS chip.|$|E
50|$|Proponents are {{advocating the}} Jaitapur Project as safe, {{environmentally}} benign and economically viable source of electrical energy {{to meet the}} increasing electricity needs of India. They argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing India's dependence on foreign oil. The promoter of Jaitapur project is Nuclear Power Corporation of India. It is a public Sector Enterprise under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy (India). I know the environmentalists will not be very happy with mydecision, but it is foolish romance to think that India can attain highgrowth rate and sustain the energy needs of a 1.2 billion populationwith the help of solar, wind, biogas and such other forms of energy.It is paradoxical that environmentalists are against nuclear energy, Jairam Ramesh, Environment Minister. The Hindu November 28, 2010 As of 2010, India is sixth in rank, after USA, France, Japan, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Korea, to have twenty or more nuclear power reactors in operation.According to former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission Anil Kakodkar, the Jaitapur site is the best as it fulfilled the technical and scientific requirements for a nuclear power plant. It is proposed that the spent fuel generated at this nuclear power plant be recycled. Only five per cent of it would be encapsulated and stored for 30 to 40 years, till scientists develop some technology to treat it.The environmental impact assessment and other associated studies of the Jaitapur project {{have been carried out}} in detail {{over the last few years}} by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur in collaboration with several other reputed organisations specializing in specific environment studies.These studies include Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Pre-operational Baseline Radiological Survey of the Area around JNPP Site, Central Water and Power Research Station Pune, <b>Thermal</b> <b>Dispersion</b> Studies for Condenser Cooling Water (CCW) Discharges, Konkan Krishi Vidyapith, College of Forestry, Dapoli, Baseline Biodiversity Study of the area around JNPP Site.|$|E

Besides the classical analysis of the photoacoustic part of the signals, which involves fitting surface acoustic wave dispersion curves, the photothermal part of the signals is analyzed by introducing <b>thermal</b> wave <b>dispersion</b> curves to represent and interpret their grating wavelength dependence.

The continuity, momentum and energy equations are solved for representative elementary volumes (REVs) of the porous media to obtain microscopic velocities in the voids between the rods and temperature distribution for entire of the REVs. Volume averaging method is employed to compute the macroscopic velocity and temperature values. There are velocity and temperature deviations between the macroscopic and microscopic values. These deviations are computed numerically and <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> coefficients of the porous media are determined. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze {{the effects of}} pore to throat size ratio on the longitudinal and transverse <b>thermal</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the porous media.
