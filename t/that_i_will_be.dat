500|$|On July 6, 1902, Flick hit three triples in one game. Between 1900 and 2010, 49 players {{accomplished}} that feat. By early 1904, Flick did {{not want}} to re-sign with Cleveland for the offered $2,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Plans were being made to run a railroad through a corner of Flick's farm and Flick hoped to hire some of his horses to the construction team. [...] "After July 4, my farm work will be along so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to give considerable attention to independent ball", he said.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{narrowly}} won the Democratic primary election, defeating Elwood Caudill Jr., {{a deputy}} clerk in the Rowan County property valuation administrator's office, by 23 votes and {{advancing to the}} general election against Republican John Cox. Davis won the election, with Cox subsequently alleging that nepotism was to blame for his loss. After winning the race, Davis told The Morehead News, [...] "My words can never express the appreciation but I promise {{to each and every}} one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the very best working clerk that I can be and will be a good steward of their tax dollars and follow the statutes of this office to the letter." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Gara {{used his}} inaugural {{column for the}} Irish Examiner to comment on his {{decision}} to retire: [...] "I have ambitions {{in the years ahead}} to coach at a high level and, with this in mind, I can confirm now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> joining Racing Métro's coaching staff in July. I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|While Bush {{endorsed}} the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, {{he declined to}} endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump {{and he did not}} attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, [...] "I'm worried <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the last Republican president." [...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.|$|E

500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E

2500|$|Although Bradley {{believed}} his actions caused Allen's relief, recent scholarship suggests that Allen's {{return to the}} United States was planned by Eisenhower and Patton before the Sicilian campaign began.

The answer to this one is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> glad to have General Allen again as a division commander.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Morris {{published}} his second book, , about Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret physician convicted of killing {{his wife and}} two daughters on February 17, 1970. Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research. Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: [...] "What happened here is wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances.

[...] Bragg dealt with this rivalry in the Tullahoma Campaign by assigning Wheeler to guard the army's right flank while Forrest guarded the left. A Union cavalry advance on Shelbyville on June 27 trapped Wheeler and 50 of his men {{on the north side}} of the Duck River, forcing Wheeler to plunge his horse over a 15-foot embankment and escape through the rain-swollen river.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 {{interview}} when a Canadian interviewer {{mentioned the}} Rastafari {{belief that he}} was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he responded by saying: [...] "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." [...] His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is [...] "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement". For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God. However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.|$|E

Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E
