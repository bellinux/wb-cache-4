25|$|The Israelites {{imagined}} the Earth to be a disc floating on water; an arched firmament separated the Earth from the heavens. Like most ancient peoples, the Hebrews believed <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> solid dome with the Sun, Moon, planets and stars embedded in it.|$|E

25|$|The Aztec world {{consisted}} of three main parts: the earth world on which humans lived (including Tamoanchan, the mythical origin of human beings), an underworld which belonged to the dead (called Mictlan ("place of death")), and the upper plane in the sky. The earth and the underworld were both open for humans to enter, whereas the upper plane in the sky was impenetrable to humans. Existence was envisioned as straddling the two worlds in a cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. Thus {{as the sun was}} believed to dwell in the underworld at night to rise reborn in the morning and maize kernels were interred to later sprout anew, so the human and divine existence was also envisioned as being cyclical. The upper and nether worlds were both thought to be layered. Mictlan had nine layers which were inhabited by different deities and mythical beings. The sky had thirteen layers, the highest of which was called Omeyocan ("place of duality") and served as the residence of the progenitor dual god Ometeotl. The lowest layer of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> verdant spring-like place with abundant water called Tlalocan ("the place of Tlaloc").|$|E
500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as it scared the horses. However, the snow falling from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> foam substance. The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) to just be the [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|E

60|$|We {{got up at}} five-thirty. At dawn <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> cold leaden gray, with a dull {{gold and}} rose in the east. A hard wind, eager and nipping, blew up the canyon. At six o'clock the sky brightened {{somewhat}} and the day did not promise so threatening.|$|E
60|$|With a {{sense of}} unreality she {{perceived}} that the night had gone. Over the quiet street below there brooded that strange, metallic light which ushers in {{the dawn of a}} fine day.
