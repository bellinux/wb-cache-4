The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E

The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 {{vote in the}} Senate.

5|$|The Reform Act itself did {{not affect}} {{constituencies}} in Scotland or Ireland. However, reforms there were {{carried out by the}} Scottish Reform Act and the Irish Reform Act.

5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China.

5|$|During {{and shortly}} after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were {{inserted}} into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11thand 12thcenturies, settlement in <b>those</b> <b>countries</b> was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked {{with the creation of}} a castle.|$|E
