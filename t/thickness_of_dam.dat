40|$|The {{flexibility}} coefficient is popularly used {{to implement the}} macroevaluation of shape, safety, and economy for arch dam. However, the description of {{flexibility coefficient}} has not drawn a widely consensus all the time. Based on {{a large number of}} relative instance data, the relationship between influencing factor and flexibility coefficient is analyzed by means of partial least-squares regression. The partial least-squares regression equation of flexibility coefficient in certain height range between 30 [*]m and 70 [*]m is established. Regressive precision and equation stability are further investigated. The analytical model of statistical flexibility coefficient is provided. The flexibility coefficient criterion is determined preliminarily to evaluate the shape of low- and medium-sized arch dam. A case study is finally presented to illustrate the potential engineering application. According to the analysis result of partial least-squares regression, it is shown that there is strong relationship between flexibility coefficient and average <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>dam,</b> thickness-height ratio of crown cantilever, arc height ratio, and dam height, but the effect of rise-span ratio is little relatively. The considered factors in the proposed model are more comprehensive, and the applied scope is clearer than that of the traditional calculation methods. It is more suitable for the analogy analysis in engineering design and the safety evaluation for arch dam...|$|E

Take the Shi-Men reservoir water district as example, the three large-scale check dam on the upstream of the Shi-Men reservoir are choked with silt already. Their block the soil sand function has already lost. When the Shi-Men reservoir meet the typhoon or torrential rain each time, turbid degree of the source water will raise, and this make the people of Tao Yuan lack for water. We use flume experiment to test the silt particle poisoning effect of the Porous media check dams on this research. This research adapts the fixed-bed model to proceed the flume experiment. We use regular depth of water and provide 20 kilograms of fine sand in each experiment to test different <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>dam</b> and stone material. We use the digital camera to shoot the under water delta moving situation and discuss each topic like the under water pile up development and movement, sediment trapping efficiency, ration of sand imprisoning, and the concentration of slit. We found that the situation of sand imprisoning and moving under water is similar between porous media check dams and close check dams. They both develop from hydraulic jump to the downstream. We also find that the thicker of the dam, the better sediment trapping result we get. The river is the stronger in intensity, the heavier the ability that the rivers can entrain the silt particle is. The lager stone particle size in the dame, the greater the hole rate is, the less silt particle that can block is. Above all, we can know that dam body thickness, rivers intensity, and the stone particle size in the dame can influence the sediment trapping efficiency of dam. 近年來台灣各集水區上游所建構之防砂工程，現今都已呈現接近淤滿之情況；以石門水庫集水區為例，石門水庫上游三座大型防砂壩均已淤滿，攔阻土砂功能已喪失，使得石門水庫每遇颱風豪雨，庫區內源水濁度便會升高，使得大桃園地區社會民眾面臨缺水危機。故本研究針對孔隙型壩體對泥砂囚砂效果，利用渠槽實驗進行孔隙型防砂壩對泥砂囚砂效果之研究。 本研究採用定床模型進行渠槽實驗，於每組實驗針對不同壩體厚度及填充石材，以固定水深方式，於每組實驗供以 20 公斤細砂，並以數位攝影機拍攝水下三角洲運移情形加以討論。本研究分別就水下堆積體之發展及運移方式、壩後流速剖面量測、囚砂率及水體中泥砂濃度加以討論。研究發現，本孔隙型壩體水下堆積體運移情形與全封閉壩體相似，均從水躍處開始向下游發展；而實驗中亦發現壩體厚度越厚，囚砂效果越佳；水流強度越強，水流所能挾帶泥砂之能力越大，壩體囚砂效果越差；當壩體填充石材粒徑越大，孔隙率越大，所能攔阻之泥砂越少。綜合以上幾點，可發現壩體厚度、水流強度及填充石材粒徑大小均會影響壩體囚砂效益。 本研究亦提出利用連續式孔隙型防砂壩之使用原則，希冀對未來工程上施作防砂壩構想上，能有所突破及依據。謝 誌	I 摘 要	II ABSTRACT	III 目 錄	IV 圖 目 錄	VI 表 目 錄	X 一	前言	 1 1. 1 	研究動機	 1 1. 2 	研究目的及內容	 1 二	前人研究	 3 2. 1 	國內外壩體之討論	 3 2. 1. 1 	全封閉型防砂壩	 3 2. 1. 1. 1. 	義大利山區：	 3 2. 1. 1. 2. 	奧地利山區	 5 2. 1. 1. 3. 	大陸黃土高原之淤地壩	 6 2. 1. 2 	孔隙型防砂壩	 7 2. 1. 3 	開口型防砂壩	 9 2. 1. 3. 1. 	義大利山區開口型防砂壩	 9 2. 1. 3. 2. 	奧地利山區開口型防砂壩	 10 2. 1. 4 	小結	 12 2. 2 	壩體囚砂理論	 12 2. 2. 1 	全封閉型壩體囚砂理論	 13 2. 2. 2 	開口型壩體囚砂理論	 13 2. 3 	水流強度與泥砂運移方式	 16 2. 4 	水下堆積體	 18 三	壩體實驗構想	 20 四	渠槽實驗設計及實驗流程	 23 4. 1 	壩後流速剖面量測設計	 23 4. 2 	孔隙型壩體囚砂特性研究之實驗設計	 25 4. 3 	孔隙型壩體間填充石材設計	 28 4. 4 	供砂系統	 28 4. 5 	實驗流程	 31 4. 5. 1 	壩後流速剖面量測實驗步驟	 31 4. 5. 2 	壩體囚砂特性實驗步驟	 33 4. 6 	實驗條件	 35 五	實驗結果與分析	 37 5. 1 	實驗現象概述	 37 5. 1. 1 	壩後流速剖面探討	 37 5. 1. 2 	實驗現象描述	 44 5. 2 	水下堆積體運移速度之比較	 48 5. 2. 1 	加入粗砂後水下堆積體運移速度之比較	 49 5. 2. 2 	加入細砂後水下堆積體運移速度之比較	 49 5. 2. 3 	小結	 50 5. 3 	壩體囚砂之探討	 50 5. 3. 1 	加入粗砂後之改良型壩體囚砂結果	 53 5. 3. 2 	加入細砂後之改良型壩體囚砂結果	 55 5. 4 	泥砂濃度關係之探討	 58 5. 4. 1 	供給粗砂時泥砂濃度關係之探討	 59 5. 4. 2 	供給細砂時泥砂濃度關係之探討	 61 5. 4. 3 	小結	 63 5. 5 	囚砂率與壩體形狀因子之關係	 63 5. 6 	全封閉型防砂壩之探討	 66 5. 6. 1 	全封閉壩體水下堆積型態及運移情形	 67 5. 6. 2 	全封閉型壩體囚砂效率之探討	 67 5. 6. 3 	全封閉型壩體泥砂濃度之探討	 68 5. 6. 4 	小結	 68 5. 7 	孔隙型壩體與全封閉型壩體之探討	 69 六	結論	 70 參考文獻	 71 附 錄	 7...|$|E

In this study, slit dam with varied slit width, i. e., slits of different heights, was proposed to achieve the safe and economical objectives. To ensure the stability <b>of</b> slit <b>dam</b> with varied slit width, four different conditions with two different heights were analyzed in this study: (1) filled dam with normal flow under maximum earthquake, (2) filled dam with maximum flow, (3) empty dam impacted by debris flow, and (4) nearly filled dam striken by giant boulder at the top <b>of</b> <b>dam.</b> For illustrative purpose, an 8 meters high slit dam with varied slit width under condition (4) was designed to illuminate the mechanics analysis, <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> at different elevation, and the reguired amounts of steel bar.

Seismic risk {{analysis}} is greatly helpful to seismic safety evaluation <b>of</b> <b>dams.</b> A preliminary study on seismic {{risk analysis}} <b>of</b> arch <b>dam</b> based on numerical simulation is presented. The numerical procedure approximately {{takes into account}} the influence of concrete heterogeneity, it can model the response <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> from elastic vibration to ultimate failure. Five seismic damage levels including no damage, minor damage, medium damage, serious damage and collapse <b>of</b> <b>dam</b> are defined. Through Monte-Carlo analysis of nonlinear response <b>of</b> the <b>dam,</b> which considers uncertainty persistent in ground motion input as well as material properties of concrete, status <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> after subjected to earthquakes is obtained. The final seismic risk <b>of</b> the <b>dam,</b> which conforms to the norm distribution, is reached based on data fitting. The results provide meaningful reference to seismic safety evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b> 1...|$|R

Certain management decisions regarding dam removal, however, may be required before resources may be allocated to provide sufficient data to evaluate whether dam removal is a viable option. Here, we present a case study and demonstrate that {{some aspects of the}} sediment transport characteristics following dam removal can be evaluated with very limited information. The case study in question involves J. C. Boyle, Copco, and Iron Gate Dams on the Klamath River, California which together have an estimated 12 million m 3 {{of sediment}} deposited in their reservoirs. With a reconnaissance field observation and upon examination of the very limited existing field data, we determined {{that it is possible to}} evaluate the potential for sediment deposition downstream <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> following the removal <b>of</b> the <b>dams</b> under the worst-case-scenario assumptions. The evaluation was carried out with the help of DREAM- 1, one <b>of</b> the <b>Dam</b> Removal Express Assessment Models developed at Stillwater Sciences. Results of the assessment indicate that potential sediment deposition would occur only for a brief period within approximately 10 km downstream <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> with a maximum <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> sediment deposition no more than 1. 2 m...|$|R

Study area was divided with up- and downstream <b>of</b> Chungju <b>Dam</b> in the upper Han River <b>of</b> Paldang <b>Dam.</b> The model was calibrated and verified for the flood event of 1995 - 2008. The effects of flood control <b>of</b> Chungju <b>Dam</b> were compared with the simulation results without the dam, and the rising effects of stage in the main observation stations were analyzed by the variation <b>of</b> released <b>dam</b> discharge.
