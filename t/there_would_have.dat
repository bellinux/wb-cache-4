5|$|The current 63rd Street Line was {{the final}} version of {{proposals}} for a northern midtown tunnel from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the Second and Sixth Avenue lines, which date back to the IND Second System of the 1920s and 1930s. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the MTA's Program For Action. In the original 1960s plans, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a station (in addition to or as an alternative to 21st Street–Queensbridge) located farther east at Northern Boulevard, one block north of the Queens Plaza station of the Queens Boulevard line. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a pedestrian transfer passageway between the two stations.|$|E

5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. At ground level, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the street junction Elisenbergveien–Frognerveien.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm postponed the bi-annual Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda sailboat {{race for}} two consecutive days {{due to the}} forecast one of the storm.

5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|The Scott Wilson Report did not {{consider}} extending the line beyond Tweedbank due to the increased capital and operating costs of continuing further without a corresponding increase in passenger demand. The Campaign for Borders Rail consider nevertheless that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{a strong case for}} reaching Melrose {{on the basis of the}} town's role in Borders tourism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a caudal keel present {{on either side of}} the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further work {{being carried out}} on the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although peace was declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly what shape the fort took; archaeological investigations suggest that it was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been battery positions {{on either side of}} the main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had been spent on building and developing the fortification.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and {{it appears to have}} become extinct {{by the end of the}} 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a leaning tower {{to the side of the}} building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was dismasted to the point that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike. The show's head writer and {{executive}} producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was “not in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading {{to the end of}} the season , we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again,” and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a strong football element as well, Katims said. Seven of the 22 episodes NBC ordered for Season 2 weren’t made.|$|E

5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic has {{implications}} for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary may have given some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E
