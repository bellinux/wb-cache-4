5|$|Crickets {{often appear}} as {{characters}} in literature. <b>The</b> <b>Talking</b> Cricket features in Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, The Adventures of Pinocchio, and in films {{based on the}} book. The eponymous insect is central to Charles Dickens's 1845 The Cricket on the Hearth, as is the chirping insect in George Selden's 1960 The Cricket in Times Square. Crickets are celebrated in poems by William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Du Fu. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets are efficient at converting their food into body mass, making them a candidate for food production. They are used as food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold deep-fried in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals. In Brazilian folklore, crickets feature as omens of various events.|$|E
5|$|Hanson {{remained}} silent during the team's interviews while Hawk {{did most of}} <b>the</b> <b>talking.</b> The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka to win the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Talk</b> Test is {{a widely}} {{recommended}} form of prescribing exercise intensity, however very few studies have specifically evaluated its physiological validity. This study evaluated the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> Test and physiologic changes occurring with exercise. We examined healthy volunteers during incremental exercise. Each subject (N = 28) completed two maximal exercise tests. One test used gas analysis to identify ventilatory threshold (VT). The second was identical, except without respiratory measurements. During this test, the subject read a standard paragraph and reported {{whether or not they}} passed <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> Test. Outcomes at VT and the last positive, positive/negative, and negative stages of <b>the</b> <b>Talk</b> Test were compared.

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe began {{competition}} in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which {{were used to}} select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz's seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was <b>the</b> <b>talking</b> point. He claimed the 100m and 200m events in times outside his best, making {{it the first time}} that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.|$|E
