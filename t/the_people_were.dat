5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> transported to shelters provisioned with supplies.

5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. There is evidence {{at some point in}} the past that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the colonial}} period, {{most of the}} {{surviving}} Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque {{as a result of}} the Spanish policy of congregaciones; <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns. After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating informal settlements and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century the small {{population}} of Ch'ol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{absorbed into the}} Q'eqchi' population. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century. By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because {{of a combination of}} high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians. At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal. Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén, compared to ten times that number in 1697. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.|$|E

5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E

5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities {{that may not have}} been anywhere near the epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population (where <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were)</b> and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events. Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E
5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 {{is regarded}} as a turning point in medieval history, marking a return of the Western Roman Empire, since the new emperor ruled over much of the area previously controlled by the Western emperors. It also marks a change in Charlemagne's relationship with the Byzantine Empire, as the assumption of the imperial title by the Carolingians asserted their equivalence to the Byzantine state. There were several differences between the newly established Carolingian Empire and both the older Western Roman Empire and the concurrent Byzantine Empire. The Frankish lands were rural in character, with only a few small cities. Most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> peasants settled on small farms. Little trade existed and much of that was with the British Isles and Scandinavia, in contrast to the older Roman Empire with its trading networks centred on the Mediterranean. The empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor, as well as approximately 300 imperial officials called counts, who administered the counties the empire had been divided into. Clergy and local bishops served as officials, as well as the imperial officials called missi dominici, who served as roving inspectors and troubleshooters.|$|E
