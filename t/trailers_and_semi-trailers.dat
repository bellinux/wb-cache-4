40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to obtain an insight into various secondary braking systems for goods vehicles. Practical tests were carried out with a tractor- semi-trailer combination. The performance of various split braking systems as well as spring brake actuators are shown. With {{nearly all of the}} secondary braking systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal requirements for the braking path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations for legal requirements concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors for semi-trailers should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles <b>and</b> <b>trailers</b> (<b>semi-trailers)</b> should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|R

50|$|McKillops Road is the {{northern}} park boundary, with the Alpine National Park {{to the north}} of the road. The road is designated unsuitable for caravans, <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> due to its long, narrow, and steep descent down to McKillops Bridge which crosses the Snowy River near its juncture with the Deddick River. A camping site near McKillops Bridge provides an excellent site for swimming, launching canoes and rafting through the rugged gorges downstream, or the start for the 18 km Silver Mine Walking Track and the short Snowy River Trail. The park is also located adjacent to the Errinundra National Park, the Coopracambra National Park, and the nearby Croajingolong National Park and Cape Conran Coastal Park.|$|E
50|$|An {{air brake}} or, more formally, a {{compressed}} air brake system, {{is a type}} of friction brake for vehicles in which compressed air pressing on a piston is used to apply the pressure to the brake pad needed to stop the vehicle. Air brakes are used in large heavy vehicles, particularly those having multiple trailers which must be linked into the brake system, such as trucks, buses, <b>trailers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> in addition to their use in railroad trains. George Westinghouse first developed air brakes for use in railway service. He patented a safer air brake on March 5, 1872. Westinghouse made numerous alterations to improve his air pressured brake invention, which led to various forms of the automatic brake. In the early 20th century, after its advantages were proven in railway use, it was adopted by manufacturers of trucks and heavy road vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Registration {{numbers for}} caravans <b>and</b> <b>trailers</b> : {{a study of}} vehicle stocks and a survey of owners of caravans <b>and</b> <b>trailers.</b> From February 1 st 2002, <b>trailers</b> (or <b>semi-trailers)</b> <b>and</b> caravans with a mass of more than 750 {{kilograms}} must have a registration number. For RDW Vehicle Technology and Information Centre, SWOV has determined how many <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> caravans require a registration number {{and to what extent}} owners are willing to apply for a registration number. The number of owners possessing a registration certificate which belongs to a (semi-) trailer or caravan heavier than 750 kg also had to be determined. The necessary data for answering the research questions was obtained in two ways: - personal interviews with various organisations (Central Bureau of Statistics, trade organisations, etc.) to determine the vehicle stocks in 2002; - a written survey of owners, with questions about the willingness to apply for a registration number, possession of a registration certificate, and the number of kilometres travelled. For answering the RDW questions, only the results for caravans <b>and</b> <b>trailers</b> heavier than 750 kg. were relevant. The object was to make the best estimate that was then possible. On account of the method used and the statistical margins the estimates can differ from the real numbers. The estimate for the number of caravans heavier than 750 kg. in 2002 is 405, 000. For <b>trailers</b> between 750 <b>and</b> 3, 500 kg. and those heavier than 3, 500 kg. the estimates are 206, 000 and 152, 000 respectively. About 4 % of the owners of a caravan heavier than 750 kg. do not have a registration certificate. For the lighter <b>and</b> heavier <b>trailers</b> this is 16 % and 3 % respectively. About 97 % of the owners of a caravan heavier than 750 kg. will apply for a registration number. For both weight classes of trailers this is 96 %. SWOV was concerned about the risks of driving with a trailer, but especially with a caravan. The survey of <b>trailer</b> <b>and</b> caravan owners made it possible to (also) ask questions about kilometres travelled per year, accidents, and safety inspection. For the time being, SWOV considers this data as basic data that is useful for other SWOV research...|$|R

In an attempt to reverse this situation, cooperative work was started between a Brazilian university and local car and truck industries, whose main goals were to design, construct and test reliable underride guards and to present solutions to government authorities. To meet these goals, to date two new retractile underride guards have been designed and three crash tests carried out.

30|$|The main {{findings}} of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, on average, TFP with CO 2 emissions over time has grown faster than TFP without CO 2 emissions, particularly for periods 1, 2, and 4. Second, efficiency change {{is the source of}} productivity growth in periods 1 and 2, whereas technical progress is the basis of productivity growth in periods 3 and 4. Third, climate change mitigation policy might lead to the increase of additional burden for the high energy-intensive sectors. And the best-performing sectors, based on their ability to maintain the positive growth of TFP with CO 2 emissions over time in response to changes in the prices of oil commodities during all periods are shown by (i) motor vehicle, <b>trailers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>semi-trailers,</b> (ii) electrical machinery and apparatus, and (iii) basic metals. Fourth, the change in environmental productivity is significantly associated with adjusted energy prices.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to map, analyze and compare the production multipliers and the overflow effect related to the manufacturing sector of motor vehicles, <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> <b>semi-trailers</b> to 43 countries plus {{the rest of the}} world - focusing on Brazil - for the years of 2000 and 2014. For this purpose, a theoretical and empirical discussion was held that contemplates theories about the Global Value Chains and a retrospective of the Brazilian automobile industry. The work used the global input-output analysis to estimate the production multipliers based on data available from WIOD (2017). As the main result the research indicates an increase of the multipliers of global production, occurring the same for this sector in Brazil. Another important result was the reduction of the overflow effect for Brazil going against the global effect, that is, this sector, which is supported by the State, decreased its external dependenc...|$|E
30|$|As expected, FIS establishments generate, on average, more freight (freight {{attraction}} plus production) than SIS ones, with 135 and 42.7 daily kg/establishment respectively. Among freight-related establishments, recycling establishments, fuel distribution, wholesale {{and medium}} manufacturing have particularly high freight generation with 519.7, 491.3, 235.8, and 189.2 daily kg/establishment, respectively. It {{is noteworthy that}} establishments in mining, heavy manufacturing and transport/warehousing are among {{the ones with the}} lower freight generation for freight-intensive sectors with 55.7, 56.8, 82.9 daily kg/establishment respectively. The latter could be a result of the type of activities covered by these sectors in the area of study. Mining covers extraction of stones and oil, and other mining support activities, which are not very common in Medellin. Heavy manufacturing covers motor vehicles, <b>trailers</b> <b>and</b> <b>semi-trailers,</b> machinery and equipment, and the like that is not very common in Medellin either, that could explain the low values of freight generation in those sectors in the city. Those values are much higher in other places of the country (e.g., el Cerrejón) and Medellin just receives the cargo (freight attraction) more than sending the cargo (freight production).|$|E
