500|$|In {{the third}} season, Ryan takes charge of Division {{to clean up}} its own mess by recalling all the agents at which point President Kathleen Spencer (Michelle Nolden) will grant the agents freedom (as all were {{recruited}} against their will). However, Nikita later learns <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> Division terminated should they fail. Nikita and others work to find rogue agents who refused the recall order, nicknamed the [...] "Dirty Thirty", until her efforts are focused on Amanda, who {{is also on the}} run and later working with a company nicknamed [...] "The Shop", who developed sophisticated technologies, some of which was used by Division. Michael and Nikita become engaged, but their relationship faces further tention after Nikita cuts off his right hand to save his life. An advanced prosthetic is eventually discovered, but it is later revealed to have been laced with nano-cells that would kill Michael unless Nikita assassinates Spencer. [...] When Michael lies to her that a cure has been found, Nikita stands down. However Spencer shoots herself in the head (she is later revealed to be a double by The Shop; the real Spencer was captured and imprisoned). Framed for her death, Nikita becomes that most wanted person in the United States. She goes on the run, but leaves Michael behind.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, a (US) congressionally {{mandated}} space commission {{headed by}} Donald Rumsfeld recommended that “the U.S. government should vigorously pursue the capabilities {{called for in}} the National Space Policy to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the option to deploy weapons in space to deter threats to, and, if necessary, defend against attacks on U.S. interests." ...|$|E

Some overlap between the roles of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire.

25|$|In May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan {{approved}} {{a constitutional amendment}} which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election {{as many times as}} he wishes.

2500|$|Reviewers, such as Bruce Ramsey, {{have sought}} to compare Berg's book with other biographies of Wilson: [...] "Berg’s {{biography}} has a fine feeling for Wilson {{and the story of}} his life, but he does present Wilson mostly from Wilson’s point of view.

50|$|A President can {{resign from}} office by {{writing a letter}} by hand to the Speaker. The President can also be impeached by the Parliament.

The independents have five, while the Nacionalista Party and Lakas Kampi CMD have four each. It is expected that Manny Villar of the Nacionalistas and Francis Pangilinan from the Liberals be the top contenders to be Senate President; incumbent Juan Ponce Enrile (PMP) originally said he would not seek the office, but with the inability of either of the frontrunners to garner the required thirteen votes, he has presented himself as a compromise candidate to avoid deadlock.|$|R

60|$|The {{system of}} {{committees}} {{appears to me}} to be good as regards the work of legislation. It seems well adapted to effect economy of time and the application of special men to special services. But I am driven to think that that connection between the chairmen of the committees and the ministers which I have attempted to describe is an arrangement very imperfect in itself, but plainly indicating the necessity of some such close relation between the executive and the legislature of the United States as does exist in the political system of Great Britain. With us the Queen's minister has a greater weight in Parliament than <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> minister could hold in Congress, because the Queen is bound to employ a minister in whom the Parliament has confidence. As soon as such confidence ceases, the minister ceases to be minister. As the Crown has no politics of its own, it is simply necessary that the minister of the day should hold the politics of the people as testified by their representatives. The machinery of <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> government cannot be made to work after this fashion. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> himself is a political officer, and the country is bound to bear with his politics for four years, whatever those politics may be. The ministry which he selects, on coming to his seat, will probably represent a majority in Congress, seeing that the same suffrages which <b>have</b> elected <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> also <b>have</b> elected <b>the</b> Congress. But there exists no necessity on the part of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to employ ministers who shall carry with them the support of Congress. If, however, the minister sat in Congress--if it were required of each minister that he should have a seat either in one House or in <b>the</b> other--the <b>President</b> would, I think, find himself constrained to change a ministry in which Congress should decline to confide. It might not be so at first, but there would be a tendency in that direction.|$|R

The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient enough number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> control of the House of Representatives.|$|E
