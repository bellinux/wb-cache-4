5000|$|With {{less than}} a minute {{remaining}} in the half, Elway completed a 31-yard pass to receiver Steve Watson and an 11-yard pass to Willhite, giving the Broncos a first down at the Giants 20-yard line. But the Giants defense forced three consecutive incompletions, the last of which saw Elway lead tight end Orson Mobley too far on a throw to the end zone and cause him to collide with the goal post. Then Karlis, who had made 11 of 12 field goals from inside 40 yards during the season, missed the ensuing field goal, ending another Denver drive with nothing to show for it. Karlis later admitted his two misses in the first half were devastating to the Broncos. [...] "Both times I didn't get my hips {{all the way through the}} kicks.

2500|$|The {{sciences}} {{of geology}} and geophysics has benefited from Danish scientists who have been - and are - heavily involved in the description {{and understanding of the}} geology of Greenland, {{one of the most important}} regions in the world to study the geological evolution of Earth. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) was founded in 1888 and Inge Lehmann (1888–1993) revealed that Earth have a solid inner core in 1936, by the use of seismology.

40|$|The {{landscape}} {{of early childhood}} education and care is changing. Governments world-wide are assuming increasing authority in relation to child-rearing {{in the years before}} school entry, beyond the traditional role in assisting parents to do the best they can by their children. As part of a social agenda aimed at forming citizens well prepared to play an active part in a globalised knowledge economy, the idea of ‘early learning’ expresses the necessity of engaging caregivers right from the start of children’s lives. Nichols, Rowsell, Rainbird, and Nixon investigate this trend over three years, in two countries, and three contrasting regions, by setting themselves the task of tracing every service and agent offering resources under the banner of early learning. Far from a dry catalogue, the study involves in-depth ethnographic research in fascinating spaces such as a church-run centre for African refugee women and children, a state-of-the-art community library and an Australian country town. Included is an unprecedented inventory of an entire suburban mall. Richly visually documented, the study employs emerging methods such as Google-mapping to trace the travels of actual parents as they search for particular resources. Each chapter features a context investigated in this large, international study: the library, the mall, the clinic, and the church.

40|$|We report {{here the}} use of Aevol, a {{software}} developed in our <b>team</b> to <b>unravel</b> the indirect selective pressures (i. e. pressures for robustness and/or evolvability) that act on the genome and transcriptome structures. Using Aevol, we have shown that these structures are under strong – although indirect – pressure due to the mutagenic effect of chromosomal rear-rangements. Individuals undergoing high spontaneous re-arrangement rates show more compact structures than indi-viduals undergoing lower rates. This phenomenon concerns genome size and content (non-coding DNA, presence of oper-ons, number of genes) as well as gene network (number of nodes and links) thus reproducing parsimoniously a large panel of known biological properties.

50|$|Beginning in 1997, Frail {{was part}} of a Caltech-NRAO <b>team</b> that helped <b>unravel</b> the long-standing mystery of the origin of gamma-ray bursts. They used an optical {{spectrum}} taken with the Keck Telescope toward the optical afterglow of GRB 970508 to establish that gamma-ray bursts were at cosmological distances. They then used the Very Large Array radio telescope discovery of radio afterglow emission from this same burst to measure the object's size and infer that the source was expanding relativistically. These two observations have remained cornerstones in the cosmological fireball model for gamma-ray bursts. In 2009 Thomson ISI listed Frail {{as one of the top}} three most cited researchers in the field of gamma-ray bursts over the last decade.|$|R

40|$|Christchurch, {{the second}} largest city in New Zealand, has varied natural environments {{including}} flood plains, sand dunes, wetlands, river banks, tidal estuaries {{and part of a}} volcanic crater rim (Christchurch City Council, 2004). Many of these environments have been modified by urban development, and currently the plant community covering the largest area of urban Christchurch is the lawn. Landcare Research received funding from the Foundation of Research Science and Technology (FRST) to develop Low Impact Urban Design and Development (LIUDD) technologies. Lincoln University, in conjunction with Landcare research, has an urban ecology <b>team</b> focused on <b>unravelling</b> the ecological processes of plant communities and classifying different biotopes in Christchurch.

40|$|Spiders {{are often}} underestimated as {{suitable}} behavioural models {{because of the}} general belief that due to their small brains their behaviour is innate and mostly invariable. Challenging this assumption, this fascinating book shows that rather than having a limited behavioural repertoire, spiders show surprising cognitive abilities, changing their behaviour to suit their situational needs. The <b>team</b> of authors <b>unravels</b> the considerable intra-specific as well as intra-individual variability and plasticity in different behaviours ranging from foraging and web building to communication and courtship. An introductory chapter on spider biology, systematics and evolution provides the reader with the necessary background information to understand the discussed behaviours and helps to place them into an evolutionary context. Highlighting an under-explored area of behaviour, this book will provide new ideas for behavioural researchers and students unfamiliar with spiders {{as well as a}} valuable resource for those already working in this intriguing field. 1.

40|$| {{distributed}} leadership, teachers seem to {{feel and}} act more as part a real team, with higher engagement in team learning as a consequence. Based {{on the findings of}} Chapters 2 to 5, three central findings of this dissertation are discussed in Chapter 6. First, it is concluded that a symbiotic relationship exists between team-oriented HRM and team leaders’ behaviour in stimulating teachers’ engagement in team learning: team leaders need team-oriented HR practices to stimulate their teachers to engage in team learning, {{but at the same time}} influence the effectiveness of these HR practices through their enactment of these practices. Second, team leaders’ ambidextrous leadership style is suggested to be crucial for stimulating teachers’ engagement in team learning. This implies that both a transactional leadership style and transformational leadership style contribute to stimulating teachers’ engagement in team learning, and that it depends on the team’s needs, tasks and challenges which leadership style is needed. Third, team empowerment and opportunities for distributed leadership are concluded to be potential catalysts for engagement in team learning. Empowerment and distributed leadership only seem to be catalysts when teacher teams are ready to take their additional responsibilities and when teachers know why and how they need to take these responsibilities. Team leaders play an important role in meeting these conditions: they can stimulate, coach and monitor teachers in taking their responsibilities and incrementally increase their team’s responsibilities.   Given these central findings, it is concluded that it is impossible for VET colleges to take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to stimulate teachers’ engagement in team learning, because teacher teams have different needs and operate in diverse situations that require different supportive approaches. Therefore, to stimulate teachers’ engagement in team learning, VET colleges should adopt a tailor-made approach that is characterised by a flexible team-oriented HRM system, flexible leadership and team empowerment.   Theoretical contributions and implications for future research Several theoretical contributions and implications for future research are discussed in Chapter 6. The contributions and implications that are related to the found relationships between team-oriented HRM, transformational leadership and distributed leadership on the one hand and engagement in team learning on the other hand are summarised here. A significant contribution made by this dissertation is that the gap between team learning literature and HRM literature is bridged by providing insights into the relationship between team-oriented HRM and engagement in team learning and into the role that team leaders play in this relationship. Moreover, recommendations are given for future research on HRM in the educational context. Because research on HRM in the educational context is still relatively limited, it is suggested that insights from this dissertation and from HRM literature in other work contexts should be incorporated in future studies: multiple HR practices should be studied simultaneously and the role of line managers or team leaders should be taken into account to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of team-oriented HRM in the educational context. Another contribution is that insights are provided into how team leaders’ transactional leadership style may affect teachers’ engagement in <b>team</b> learning by <b>unravelling</b> underlying mechanisms. Because the results suggest that unidentified underlying mechanisms may also be at play, it is recommended that future research aims to expose these mechanisms. In addition, it is recommended to examine more in-depth how transformational leaders can incrementally empower teams to stimulate engagement in team learning. The final contribution mentioned here is that this dissertation also bridges the gap between team learning literature and distributed leadership literature. The results regarding the relationship between distributed leadership and team learning suggest a reciprocal relationship and possibly a gain spiral. Future research is needed to obtain a better understanding of this reciprocity. Practical implications Because this dissertation suggests that VET colleges play a central role in stimulating teachers’ engagement in team learning, it is recommended in Chapter 6 that these colleges should invest in the development of a supportive environment for teams. Four recommondations are given that may contribute to the development of this enviroment. First, it is suggested that VET colleges invest in the continued development of a consistent and visible team-oriented HRM system, so that teachers know that they are expected to act as part of a real team and to engage in team learning. Second, because line managers or team leaders play a crucial role in the implementation of a consistent and visible team-oriented HRM system, it is recommended that VET colleges monitor and evaluate team leaders’ enactment of HR practices. Monitoring and evaulation enables VET colleges to gain insights into effective enactments and to intervene when enactments are ineffective. Inverventions could include the development of competence profiles of team leaders, the deployment of coaches for team leaders, the establishment of peer coaching meetings for team leaders, and the inclusion of HRM enactment in team leaders’ professionalisation trajectories. Third, similar interventions are suggested for developing the necessary competencies of team leaders for correctly assessing their team’s needs, tasks and challenges, and for adapting their leadership style in accordance with their assessment. Fourth, it is recommended that team leaders use an incremental approach to empower teacher teams, because teachers need time to learn why and how to take extra responsibilities and to establish leader-follower relationships. In this way, teachers are given the time to get accustomed to their extra responsibilities and to learn how to behave as informal leaders, with more engagement in team learning as a consequence...|$|R
