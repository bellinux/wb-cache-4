5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{certificate}} authority in the conventional SSL system is to vouch for {{the identity of a}} site, by checking its SSL certificate. Without some vouchsafing, one is open to a man-in-the-middle attack. A single site is vouched for by only a single certificate authority (CA), and <b>this</b> <b>CA</b> has to be trusted by the user. Web browsers typically include a list of default trusted certificate authorities, and display a warning about an [...] "untrusted connection" [...] when a site cannot be vouchsafed by a trusted CA. A problem with this system is that if a user (or browser vendor) loses trust in a CA, removing the CA from the browser's list of trusted authorities means losing trust in all the sites that used that CA. This happened when major browsers lost trust in the DigiNotar CA and sites registered with <b>this</b> <b>CA</b> had to get new certificate authorities (see Certificate authority#CA compromise for more examples of trust breaches).|$|E

Because of this, visiting the site or downloading the ISO will generate a browser security warning indicating that the certificate is not trusted. Military-issued devices already include this certificate authority in their list of trusted CAs, and so will not see these errors.|$|E

50|$|The {{states of}} our CAs have two parts, which are treated in {{different}} ways. The {{first part of}} the cell-state contains the cell's type and activity level and the second part serves as an interface to the cell's neighborhood by containing the input signals from the neighbors. Characteristic of our CA is that only part of the state of a cell is passed to its neighbors, namely the signal and then only to those neighbors specified in the fixed part of the cell state. <b>This</b> <b>CA</b> is called partitioned, because the state is partitioned into two parts, the first being fixed and the second is variable for each cell.|$|E
50|$|A {{public key}} infrastructure, such as Transport Layer Security, may harden Transmission Control Protocol against Man-in-the-middle-attacks. In such structures, clients and servers {{exchange}} certificates which are issued and verified by a {{trusted third party}} called a certificate authority (CA). If the original key to authenticate <b>this</b> <b>CA</b> has not been itself {{the subject of a}} MITM attack, then the certificates issued by the CA may be used to authenticate the messages sent by the owner of that certificate. Use of mutual authentication, in which both the server and the client validate the other's communication, covers both ends of a MITM attack, though the default behavior of most connections is to only authenticate the server.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of ground}} states {{information}} {{is stored in}} stable states of the CA. These are states such that the spins on the lattice do not change when acted upon by the CA. It is easy {{to show that the}} all +1 and the all -1 states are stable states when q=p=0. Therefore the majority vote CA can be used to store information. We can define terms analogous to thermal noise and magnetic field as T=p+q and h=(p-q)/(p+q) respectively. Similarly to the Ising model the majority vote CA can reliably store information for small values of T provided that h=0. Notice that h=0 when p=q. In other words the errors are unbiased. For even small values of h <b>this</b> <b>CA</b> fails to preserve the information.|$|E

50|$|Every cell is {{assigned}} a Cell Allocation (CA) Table. This is {{the set of}} ARFCNs that are used within the Cell. The Mobile Allocation (MA) Table is a subset of <b>this</b> <b>CA</b> Table. This table contains a list of ARFCNs that the traffic channels of that cell will hop through. The MAIO gives the index into this list from which the first ARFCN will be picked by the cell to start the hopping sequence. Every mobile station will be supplied with the MA Table and MAIO for a given dedicated connection. Using the MA table and the MAIO, the mobile station will hop in the exact sequence as the cell in dedicated mode to achieve frequency diversity. Thus, the MA Table, MAIO and the Hopping Sequence Number (HSN) completely configure a hopping sequence procedure which the mobile station and the cell will follow.|$|E
