5|$|Amid a push by Senate Democrats in July 2013 to {{eliminate}} <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> for all executive-branch nominees, senators {{struck a deal}} {{to pave the way}} for a final, up-or-down vote on Cordray's nomination. With that senators voted 71–29 on July 16, 2013 to invoke cloture on Cordray's nomination. The U.S. Senate confirmed Cordray in a 66–34 vote on July 16, 2013.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end {{debate on}} the bill: a cloture vote to end <b>the</b> <b>filibuster.</b> The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by the AMA and AARP.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} going to join <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
50|$|He {{also led}} the combat against <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> in Puebla, Rivas.|$|R

5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, {{threatened}} another filibuster, {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. <b>The</b> <b>filibuster</b> was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, {{as his own}} campaign manager. Paul's endorsement {{was seen as a}} major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, while favoring <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> and {{threatening}} {{to use it in}} 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed <b>the</b> <b>filibuster.</b> In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill <b>the</b> <b>filibuster.</b> “The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress,” Lieberman told the Hartford Courant (January 6, 1995).|$|E
25|$|Obama {{favored the}} {{increase}} in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25, and he voted to end <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> against a bill to accomplish that.|$|E
50|$|Legitimist forces {{attempted}} {{to bring up}} a small cannon to shell <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> out of <b>the</b> homes, but it was disabled in a sally by the mercenaries. The Legitmists then {{attempted to}} burn <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> out of <b>the</b> homes, succeeding in setting one alight. At this point, after four hours of combat, the order to retreat was called by Walker. The first men out of the houses surprised the Nicaraguans closest to them, and {{the remainder of the}} Legitimist forces were momentarily stunned by the American advance. As a result of <b>the</b> confusion, <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> were able to withdraw with only one more fatality.|$|R
50|$|Three of <b>the</b> <b>filibustered</b> nominees (Estrada, Pickering, and Kuhl) had withdrawn.

50|$|Juan Alfaro Ruiz was {{responsible}} for clearing <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> from <b>the</b> church. He died of cholera after the battle. One of Alajuela's cantons was named after him.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Kamber led {{the battle}} to end a Republican {{filibuster}} of the nomination of William B. Gould IV to be chair of the National Labor Relations Board. The Republicans eventually gave up <b>the</b> <b>filibuster,</b> and Gould was confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In 1850, John A. Quitman, Governor of Mississippi, was {{approached}} by <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> Narciso López to lead his filibuster expedition of 1850 to Cuba.

25|$|On October 12, 1856, Guatemalan Colonel José Víctor Zavala {{performed}} {{an act of}} courage: he crossed {{the square of the}} city to the house where Walker soldiers took shelter; under heavy fire, he made it to the enemy's flag and carried it back with him shouting to his men that <b>the</b> <b>Filibuster</b> bullets did not kill.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>filibuster</b> {{began on}} April 2 with the Abbeywood Trail {{amendment}} and occupied the legislature day and night, the members alternating in shifts. On April 4, exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let {{one of the}} NDP amendments pass, and the handful of residents of Cafon Court in Etobicoke were granted {{the right to a}} public consultation on the bill, although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own. On April 6, with the alphabetical list of streets barely into the Es, Speaker Chris Stockwell ruled that {{there was no need for}} the 220 words identical in each amendment to be read aloud each time, only the street name. With a vote still needed on each amendment, Zorra Street was not reached until April 8. The Liberal amendments were then voted down one by one, eventually using a similar abbreviated process, and <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> finally ended on April 11.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{judicial}} nominees prior to Estrada {{had been kept}} off the courts, when the Senate refused to let the nomination out of committee for a floor vote. A filibuster {{had been used in}} 1968 to extend debate regarding the elevation of Associate Justice Abe Fortas to Chief Justice of the United States, but <b>the</b> Estrada <b>filibuster</b> was different in multiple ways. Estrada's was <b>the</b> first <b>filibuster</b> ever to be successfully used against a judicial nominee who had clear support of the majority in the Senate. Estrada's was <b>the</b> first <b>filibuster</b> of any court of appeals nominee. It was also <b>the</b> first <b>filibuster</b> that prevented a judicial nominee from joining a court.|$|R
50|$|Primarily, Costa Rica {{remembers the}} Battle of Santa Rosa won by their army over <b>the</b> forces of <b>filibuster</b> William Walker. On March 20, 1856, when the Costa Rican forces reached this point, <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> were {{housed in the}} main farm building, La Casona. The ensuing battle lasted all of 14 minutes with the {{national}} militia victorious in ousting the invaders.|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 2015, Gyimah {{contributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>filibustering</b> of <b>the</b> opposition-proposed Compulsory Emergency First Aid Education (State-Funded Secondary Schools) Bill {{to make the}} {{teaching}} of first aid in primary schools compulsory.

25|$|One of {{the first}} known {{practitioners}} of <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> was the Roman senator Cato the Younger. In debates over legislation he especially opposed, Cato would often obstruct the measure by speaking continuously until nightfall. As the Roman Senate had a rule requiring all business to conclude by dusk, Cato's purposefully long-winded speeches were an effective device to forestall a vote.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable filibusters of the 1960s {{occurred}} when Southern Democrats attempted to block {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 by filibustering for 75 hours, including a 14 hour and 13 minute address by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>filibuster</b> failed when the Senate invoked cloture {{for only the second time}} since 1927.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{supported}} {{racial segregation}} and co-authored the Southern Manifesto with Strom Thurmond. Russell {{and his fellow}} Southern Senators blocked the passage of civil rights legislation via <b>the</b> <b>filibuster.</b> After Russell's protege, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, Russell led a Southern boycott of the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Russell served in the Senate until his death from emphysema in 1971.|$|E
50|$|For Costa Ricans {{the war was}} {{postponed}} until October 1856, {{the starting point for}} The Second Campaign. The emphasis of the Second Campaign was to cut off Walker's supply route which used the San Juan River and the steamboats taken by <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> from <b>the</b> Accessory Transit Company.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, William Walker, an American filibuster, began incursions into Central America. After {{landing in}} Nicaragua, he proclaimed himself as {{president}} of Nicaragua and re-instated slavery, which had been abolished. [...] He intended to expand into Costa Rica and after he entered that territory, the country declared war against his forces. Led by Commander in Chief of the Army of Costa Rica, President Juan Rafael Mora Porras, <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> were defeated and {{forced out of the}} country. Costa Rican forces followed <b>the</b> <b>filibusters</b> into Rivas, Nicaragua, where in a final battle, William Walker and his forces were finally pushed back. Juan Santamaría, a drummer boy from Alajuela who lost his life torching the filibusters' stronghold, was killed in this final battle. He is today remembered as a national hero.|$|R
50|$|Some sources cite Canales as one <b>the</b> Mexican <b>filibusters.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the United States House of Representatives, <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> (the {{right to}} {{unlimited}} debate) was used until 1842, when a permanent rule limiting {{the duration of}} debate was created. The disappearing quorum was a tactic used by the minority until Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed eliminated it in 1890. As {{the membership of the}} House grew much larger than the Senate, the House had acted earlier to control floor debate and the delay and blocking of floor votes.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, 2005, Coleman {{voted in}} favor of invoking cloture on, thus advancing, a defense {{appropriations}} bill that included oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Critics viewed this as a contradiction of 2002 pledge to oppose such drilling. Coleman stated that he did so because although he planned to vote against the bill, he did not believe that a filibuster was warranted. His vote notwithstanding, <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> held, and Coleman voted to strip the ANWR provision from the bill in a subsequent vote.|$|E
25|$|McCain {{opposes the}} federal minimum wage; instead he {{believes}} that each state should decide its own minimum wage. On January 24, 2007 he voted Yes on legislation that would allow employers to pay less than the federal minimum wage if the state set a lower minimum. He also {{voted in favor of}} maintaining <b>the</b> <b>filibuster</b> against a bill to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25. This would effectively repeal the federal minimum wage. McCain has voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the first farmers from Rivas, Nicaragua came to this region, {{beginning}} the formation of ranches.

25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the deal, <b>the</b> two <b>filibustered</b> nominees not {{mentioned}} in it (David W. McKeague and Richard Allen Griffin) were confirmed.
