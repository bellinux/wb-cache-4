After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an engine failure) and China, in which Alonso had tyre problems, Schumacher led in the championship standings {{for the first time}} during the season. Although he and Alonso had the same point total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Coolsma {{published}} a {{revised version of}} his grammar. Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, who had also preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a revised version of his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917. Her death led him <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> workload, although he found time to publish his memoirs, Terugblik op mijn levensweg, 1840–1924 (Looking Back on my Life, 1840–1924), in 1924. He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E

Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger {{was then}} made the Lord Warden in 1792. Pitt was badly {{in debt and}} King George III {{believed}} that the post, which came with a salary of £3,000 a year, would usefully supplement Pitt's income. Pitt made extensive use of the castle and by 1803 he used it as his main residence in an effort <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> living costs. Pitt's niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, joined him at Walmer between 1803 and 1806; together with Pitt, she carried out extensive work on the castle gardens, transforming them from a simple kitchen garden into a set of landscaped ornamental enclosures; Stanhope enlisted the Dover militia {{to help with the}} landscaping and planting.|$|E

After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon {{distanced himself from}} Duhalde, and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the {{government}} <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from all {{the social and political}} spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners. Cristina Kirchner won those elections.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> car {{speed on}} his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} {{the effects of}} losing second position. Glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his lollipop man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It {{was the second time}} that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg by taking the inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed Button for twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E

During the 1984–85 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he {{had to deal with}} the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort and saw that the Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of The Finished Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E

5|$|The race's first caution was necessitated on {{the same}} lap when Papis spun on the frontstretch, and slid {{backwards}} towards the first corner before getting his car facing in the racing direction. Vasser made contact with Tora Takagi who was sent into the frontstretch barrier. Bruno Junqueira and Memo Gidley spun in avoidance; the latter regained control of his car while Junqueira collided with the outside wall, causing him to become the race's first retirement. Max Wilson spun while gaining optimum tyre temperature {{and fell to the}} rear of the field. The race restarted on the ninth lap with de Ferran leading Bräck and Andretti. Bräck was held up by Wilson on the 23rd lap allowing de Ferran to establish a two-second lead over him. Wilson received a warning from the series' race control. Castroneves was passed by Franchitti for the fourth position seven laps later. Christian Fittipaldi attempted to lap Gidley on lap 37, but the latter drove defensively causing Fittipaldi <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> speed, and he was overtaken by Vasser, Adrián Fernández, and Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} in Prince Rainier III of Monaco's Royal box to collect their trophies {{and in the}} subsequent press conference. Coulthard was delighted as securing victory at the Grand Prix which he considered {{as one of the}} races he wanted to win during his career because of the challenges the drivers take on the circuit. He also commented that he wanted to wait until the pit stop stages to get ahead of Michael Schumacher and Trulli to prevent unnecessary repairs to his car. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving his tyres and fuel, as well as being informed by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> pace towards the race's latter stages. Fisichella said that he was pleased at taking third place. He also revealed that he wanted to remain at Benetton for the 2001 season after his strong result.|$|E
5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by oversteer and struggled with driving on his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove hard but experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused him to feel vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd. Both Hispania drivers lined up {{at the back of the}} field (with Karun Chandhok ahead of Senna).|$|E

5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence that they could do so with the exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only for the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also a problem with the return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive for the pilot and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran {{gained the}} lead and {{maintained}} it at the lap-104 restart. Bräck attempted to pass de Ferran around {{the outside of the}} first turn for first place but was unable to get ahead. De Ferran pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Dixon drove into the pit lane and became the race's fifth (and final) retirement on the 106th lap. His pit crew claimed his car was damaged following contact with Servià during the caution period. Kanaan was closely following Andretti but was held up by the driver which allowed Paul Tracy to pass him. The move caused Kannan's car to develop understeer and Vasser got ahead of him. Carpentier set the race's fastest lap during the 134th lap, completing a circuit in 25.521 seconds. On lap 138, Bräck drafted off slower cars while de Ferran was slowed by Papis in turn four. Bräck got ahead of de Ferran around the outside driving into the first turn to take over the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, Bräck led de Ferran by two-tenths of a second. As the two drivers went onto the backstraight, De Ferran drafted up to the outside of Bräck and closed up to him in the second and third corners. De Ferran steered right and overtook Bräck for the lead in the fourth turn's entrance. Both drivers avoided making contact at the corner's edge and de Ferran drove defensively causing Bräck <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> speed to avoid colliding with him.|$|E
5|$|Having had two frigates {{confirm that}} the French fleet was still at Brest, and {{realising}} that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone. On the same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements. At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail {{in an attempt to}} reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May and some of these ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>his</b> numbers by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.|$|E
