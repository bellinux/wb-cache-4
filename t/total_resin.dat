A preliminary economic {{evaluation of the}} process indicated that {{about one-third of the}} capital cost was attributed to the <b>total</b> <b>resin</b> inventory, and one-third of the operating cost was required for reagents to remove iron from the ion-exchange eluates. An agitated Pachuca elution system was investigated in place of a fixed-bed elution system. The Pachuca system reduced the resin inventory by 27 pet when compared with the fixed-bed elution system. Processing fresh spent copper leach solution reduced the resin inventory by 20 pct and resin iron loading by 80 pct. Reagent requirements for removing iron from the eluates were decreased because less iron was extracted. The Pachuca system, along with processing fresh spent copper leach solution, reduced the <b>total</b> <b>resin</b> inventory by 47 pct.

A series of CFRP laminates were prepared by the RTM technique varying the fibre volume content (30 to 60 %), reinforcement material (woven fabrics vs. unidirectional fibre reinforcements), curing temperatures (40 °C to 120 °C), additives (SiO 2 nanoparticles as matrix fillers) and using a surface finish applied as an in-mould coating.

These results correlate very well with the performed analysis of surface roughness.

Thus, using of unidirectional fibre reinforcement (no weft or sewing threads; very fine filaments), low curing temperatures (slow curing processes) and an in-mould coating are most successful for reduction of fibre print through effect and getting surface similar to Class A properties. In addition, the surface quality is quite positively affected by the application of nanoparticles and also strongly controlled by roughness of tooling...|$|E

Samples of each soil were subjected to one of three methods of increasingly aggressive dispersion in the order water (WD), mechanical (MD) or chemical (CD). A general, although not exclusive, inverse relationship existed between the concentration of various attributes (these included organic carbon, oxalate and dithionite iron contents, <b>total</b> P, <b>resin</b> and water extractable P) and particle size. The quantity, composition and physico-chemical properties of individual size separates were sensitive to the dispersion method used.

The total P content of the whole soil could be reasonably obtained by summing the appropriate quantities of each particle size material, however, resin and water extractable P were not adequately predicted using this approach. Together these observations have implications for laboratory and field situations where artificial disaggregation and/or selective separation and transport of fine soil material may occur.

Potential determinants of exposure were documented concurrently, including weather conditions, tree species, wood conditions, jobs, tasks, equipment used, and certain control measures. Over 220 personal samples were taken for each contaminant. Geometric mean concentrations were 0. 98 mg/m 3 for inhalable particulate, 0. 49 mg/m 3 for estimated wood dust, 8. 04 mg/m 3 for <b>total</b> <b>resin</b> acids, and 1. 11 mg/m 3 for total monoterpenes. Multiple regression models for all contaminants indicated that spruce and pine produced higher exposures than alpine fir or mixed tree species, cleaning up sawdust increased exposures, and personnel enclosure was an eective means of reducing exposures. Sawing wood in the primary breakdown areas of the mill was the main contributor to monoterpene exposures, so exposures were highest for the barker operator, the head rig operator, the canter operator, the board edgers, and a roving utility worker in the sawmill, and lowest in the planer mills (after kiln drying of the lumber) and yard.

40|$|Conifers, {{especially}} pines, {{produce and}} store under pressure monoterpene-laden resin in canals located throughout the plant. When {{the plants are}} damaged and resin canals punctured, the resin is exuded and the monoterpenes are released into the atmosphere, a process that {{has been shown to}} influence ecosystem-level monoterpene emissions. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the small amounts of resin that are exuded from branches, expanding needles, developing pollen cones, and terminal buds in the absence of any damage. The goal of this study was to provide the first estimate of the potential of this naturally-exposed resin to influence emissions of monoterpenes from ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystems. When resin is first exuded as small spherical beads from undamaged tissues it emits monoterpenes to the atmosphere at a rate that is four orders of magnitude greater than needle tissue with an equivalent exposed surface area and the emissions from exuded beads decline exponentially as the resin dries. We made measurements of resin beads on the branches of ponderosa pine trees in the middle of the growing season and found, on average, 0. 15 cm² of exposed resin bead surface area and 1250 cm² of total needle surface area per branch tip. If the resin emerged over the course of 10 days, resin emissions would make up 10 % of the ecosystem emissions each day. Since we only accounted for exposed resin at a single point in time, this is probably an underestimate of how much <b>total</b> <b>resin</b> is exuded from undamaged pine tissues over the course of a growing season.

Expansion of high amylose corn starch (gelatinisation and retrogradation) yielded a high surface area material. The formulation with 20 % wt. of gelatinised starch yielded a film with 227 % improvement in tensile strength and 166 % enhancement in Young’s modulus, compared to those with no added starch. Moreover, expanded starch granules uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix, resulting in a complete disappearance of phase separation. This was attributed to better interfacial adhesion of porous expanded starch and the polymer matrix. Thermal analysis revealed retardation in the cure process in the presence of starch, however the hydroxyl groups of starch were likely to enhance the extent of curing, as indicated by the higher total enthalpy of reaction. Furthermore, these bio-based composites demonstrated excellent thermal stability. Esterification of expanded starch dramatically decreased the water uptake of the resins however, the mechanical properties were compromised, owing to low thermal stability of the esterified starch.

40|$|Due to the {{exceptional}} advantages of sol-gel process, organically modified silane (ormosil) coating {{has been applied}} to study the corrosion protection of aluminum alloy. In the present work, GPTMS/MTMS sol-gel solution was prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimetoxysilane (GPTMS) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) in aqueous solution of 0. 05 M acetic acid in molar ratios 3 : 1. To prepare the ormosil coating solutions, a crosslinking agent hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM) and a blocked acid catalyst p-toluenesulphonic (p-TSA) were combined with the sol-gel solution. Aluminum substrates were dip coated and cured at 130 degrees C for 45 min. Effectiveness of HMMM as a crosslinking agent was analyzed by evaluating corrosion resistance, chemical resistance and hydrophobicity of coating using potentiodynamic polarization method, immersion test and water contact angle, respectively. UV stability of sol-gel solution, ormosil coating formulation and coated substrate was also studied using UV-vis spectroscopy and UV-weatherometer to see performance of coating in outdoor application. Thermal behavior of ormosil was characterized using TGA and DSC. Surface morphology and structural characteristics were also characterized using SEM, AFM and FIF-IR-RAS (reflection absorption spectroscopy). Pencil hardness, impact test and bend test were carried out to determine the adhesion, hardness and flexibility of coating. Results show that the coatings were uniform, transparent and crack free. Corrosion resistance and hydrophobicity of coating system with 20 H- 30 H (20 - 30 wt% HMMM of <b>total</b> <b>resin)</b> of HMMM were found excellent. All the coatings have good resistance to isopropanol, toluene, 3. 5 % NaCl and methyl ethyl ketone. However, it degraded in nitric acid solution. UV-vis spectroscopy and UV-weathering suggest that these coatings are stable in sunlight. The gloss retention for 25 H coating was found about 83. 32 % without any visible pit or corrosion product. The coatings are thermally stable upto 325 degrees C and none of coatings show evidence of glass transition temperature. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Past {{research}} has implied {{that differences in}} blender performance between commercial and laboratory particleboard blenders may not be attributed to resin distribution between screen fractions, as is commonly believed in the industry today, but to which particles within a screen fraction have resin and which do note To test this, the effect of varying resin distributions within screen fractions was studied and related to internal bond, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, and linear expansion. A commercial particleboard furnish was screened into four different fractions, and boards {{were made in the}} laboratory in such a manner that each board had a different percentage of unblended particles of different screen fraction size. Test results showed that as the ratio of unblended particles in a board increased from 0 to 50 percent, strength properties decreased, probably due to an increasing lack of bonding sites between particles coming into contact with each other as the ratio increased. A significant finding in this study was that when the entire fines fraction (- 20 - mesh Tyler) was unblended, strength properties were lower than when the entire coarse fraction was unblended (+ 20 -mesh Tyler). The reason the unblended fines had such a great influence on reducing strength properties was attributed to the extremely large relative surface area (87. 8 percent of the total surface area in the board) that the fines have. When such a high percentage of surface area in a board goes unblended, strength properties tend to decrease. When the average internal bond was plotted at each ratio of unblended particles, it was determined present commercial standards (CS 236 - 66 Type 1 B 1) for internal bond of a 43 pounds per cubic foot board could be met with the laboratory blender by not blending 50 percent of the furnish in a board. If a commercial blender could obtain the efficiency of the laboratory blender, a greater percentage of particles could be blended resulting in greater internal bond properties. Substantial resin savings could then be realized by reducing the <b>total</b> <b>resin</b> content of the furnish to the point where standards could still be met. Obtaining optimum relative spread rates of resin to relative surface area in each fraction is throught to be the best solution for increasing resin efficiency in commercial particleboard blenders. The particleboard industry may be able to make resin savings by utilizing blenders in parallel to accomplish obtaining optimum relative spread rates...|$|E
40|$|Pinus species exhibit fast {{growth and}} are good {{producers}} of wood, cellulose and resin. Brazil {{is the second}} largest producer of resin. The People?s Republic of China is the main producer with approximately 90 % world?s resin production. Turpentine, volatile fraction, and rosin, solid fraction, are two major fractions or resin. The distillation process continues up to 170 ° C can be extracted about 95 % of the <b>total</b> gum turpentine <b>resin,</b> preserving its constituents. There is little research using thermal analysis to study pine resin properties. This work involved evaporating volatile fraction of resins in an oven at 170 ºC consisted of 20 different samples from Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis and was compared with results obtained in thermal analysis to quantify the same fraction for each one. The volatile fraction in the oven (170 ºC) was from 14. 69 % to 24. 05 %. This fraction obtained through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was from 13. 37 % to 23. 64 %. The results demonstrate that the TGA technique is capable of accurately determining the volatile and non-volatile fractions of the resin and this technical proved to be suitable for further analyses. 2014 CBRATEC...|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{titanium}} {{engine driven}} rotary instruments are used increasingly in endodontic practice. One frequently mentioned problem is fracture of an instrument in the root canal. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate wear characteristics of Nimbi files with usage, which represent warning signs that may occur before breakage and the incidence of breakage. Profile 0. 04 taper rotary NiTi files from size 20 to size 40 were used in this study. These files were used in a <b>total</b> of 20 <b>resin</b> simulated toot canal blocks (ALSO) (21 mm length and 20 degree curvature) for 14 cycles. The total number of files used was 33 files. The analysis showed that most incidents of fracture occur in file size 20 (46 %) as a result of torsional failure, while the incidence of fracture was 27 % in size 25, 15 % for size 30, 6 % for size 35 and 6 % for size 40. It was concluded that torsional failure occurred more frequently than flexure fatigue and small files were more liable to fracture than large ones, indicating that rotary instruments should be used less than 8 cycles before being discarded, depending on curvature and complexity of the canal, instrument size and the method of instrumentation.

40|$|Statement of the problem: Improving the {{adaptation}} of fiber reinforced posts through relining may affect the retention of the posts. Purpose: To investigate the effect of post relining, cement type, and thermocycling on the push-out bond strength of fiber reinforced posts. Materials and methods: (48) endodontically treated human teeth were excessively flared using diamond stones. The teeth {{were divided into two}} groups; group (1) (n =  24) received glassix glass fiber posts adapted to the flared canals by relining with composite resin and group (2) (n =  24) received non-relined glassix glass fiber post. Samples of each group were divided into three subgroups (n =  8) according to the type of cement used; subgroup (a) : luted using Metacem Refill, a <b>total</b> etch <b>resin</b> cement, subgroup (b) : luted using Rely X Unicem, a self-adhesive resin cement and subgroup (c) : luted using RelyX Luting, a resin modified glass ionomer cement. Half the samples of each subgroup (n =  4) were subjected to thermocycling. The samples were sectioned horizontally into 2  mm thick slices yielding 3 sections for each sample. Retention was evaluated using push out bond strength test using universal testing machine. The maximum failure load was recorded and used to calculate the push-out bond strength. Data was statistically analyzed and mode of failure was assessed using magnifying glass. Results: Relined posts showed statistically significantly higher mean push-out bond strength than non-relined posts. Rely X Unicem showed the statistically significantly highest mean push-out bond strength among tested cements. Metacem showed significantly lower mean push-out bond strength than Rely X Unicem. Rely X Luting showed the statistically significantly lowest mean push-out bond strengths. There was no statistically significant difference between mean push-out bond strength with and without thermocycling. Most failures occurred at the cement–dentin interface in the relined group, while adhesive failure occurred at the cement-post interface in non-relined group. Conclusions: Relining glass fiber posts with composite resin in order to fit wide flared canals instead of using cement for compensating the discrepancy, improves the push out bond strength of glass fiber posts to root canal dentin. Moreover the use of resin cement with high mechanical properties to lute glass fiber post is highly recommended...|$|R
