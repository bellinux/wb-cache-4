He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about <b>the</b> <b>segregated</b> nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E

5|$|Born to a {{coal mining}} family in West Virginia in 1929, Charlton moved to The Bronx in New York City during World War II. Enlisting {{out of high}} school in 1946, Charlton served first in {{occupied}} Germany, then occupied Japan in administrative duties before requesting transfer to the front. An African American, Charlton was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>segregated</b> 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division fighting in the Korean War. During a battle for Hill 543 near the village of Chipo-ri, Charlton took command of his platoon after its commanding officer was injured, leading it on three successive assaults of the hill. Charlton continued to lead the attack despite mortal wounds until Chinese troops occupying it were destroyed, saving his platoon. For these actions, Charlton was awarded the medal.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's future {{had been}} {{referred}} to Sixth Army Group, the controlling formation, for further consideration; after some debate, they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on the enlisted men of the unit. The second inspection showed that the enlisted men were broadly competent at their duties, but {{that most of them}} preferred rear-area duties over combat roles. The inspection recommended that the enlisted men be transferred to one of <b>the</b> <b>segregated</b> infantry divisions. In the event, the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters, where it was used in a service role. It remained nominally active—to avoid the political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit—but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of <b>the</b> <b>segregated</b> 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} mean-field {{study of the}} binary Bose-Einstein {{condensate}} mixtures {{as a function of}} the mutual repulsive interaction strength. In <b>the</b> phase <b>segregated</b> regime, we find that there are two distinct phases: <b>the</b> weakly <b>segregated</b> phase characterized by a `penetration depth' and <b>the</b> strongly <b>segregated</b> phase characterized by a healing length. In <b>the</b> weakly <b>segregated</b> phase <b>the</b> symmetry of the shape of each condensate will not take that of the trap because of the finite surface tension, but its total density profile still does. In <b>the</b> strongly <b>segregated</b> phase even <b>the</b> total density profile takes a different symmetry from that of the trap because of the mutual exclusion of the condensates. The lower critical condensate-atom number to observe the complete phase segregation is discussed. A comparison to recent experimental data suggests that <b>the</b> weakly <b>segregated</b> phase has been observed. Comment: minor change...|$|R
40|$|Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282 are {{relatively}} new precipitation hardening nickel based superalloys with good high temperature mechanical properties. In addition, the weldability of these superalloys enhances easy fabrication. The combination of high temperature capabilities and superior weldability is unmatched by other precipitation hardening superalloys and {{linked to the}} amount of the γ’ hardening precipitates in the materials. Hence, it is these properties that make Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282 desirable in the manufacture of hot sections of aero engine components. Studies show that cast products are less weldable than wrought products. Segregation of elements in the cast results in inhomogeneous composition which consequently diminishes weldability. Segregation during solidification of the cast products results in dendritic microstructure with <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> elements occupying interdendritic regions. These segregating elements are trapped in secondary phases present alongside γ matrix. Studies show that in Allvac 718 Plus, <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> phase is Laves while in Haynes 282 <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> phase is not yet fully determined. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of homogenization heat treatments in eliminating segregation in cast Allvac 718 Plus and Haynes 282. Paramount to the study was the effect of different homogenization temperatures and dwell time in the removal of <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> phases. Experimental methods used to both qualify and quantify <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> phases included SEM, EDX analysis, manual point count and macro Vickers hardness tests. Main results show that there is a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>segregating</b> phases in both materials as homogenization proceeds hence a disappearance of the dendritic structure. In Allvac 718 Plus, plate like structures is observed to be closely associated with the Laves phase at low temperatures and dwell times. In addition, Nb is found to be <b>segregating</b> in <b>the</b> interdendritic areas. The expected trend of increase in Laves {{as a result of the}} dissolution of the plate like structures at the initial stage of homogenization is only detectable for few cases. In Haynes 282, white and grey phases are clearly distinguished and Mo is observed to be segregating in interdendritic areas...|$|R
5|$|Offscreen, Mutual {{remained}} an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule {{of news and}} opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis. The network aired that year's NFL Championship Game on December 8, the first national broadcast of the annual event. Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own {{with that of the}} wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS. At 2:26p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship station WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier. In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück. The following month, Meet the Press premiered with Martha Rountree as moderator. For {{a year and a half}} in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow. In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and the network's own affiliates in <b>the</b> <b>segregated</b> South.|$|E
