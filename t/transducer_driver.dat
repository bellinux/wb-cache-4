The technique {{is based on a}} time domain analysis of the transient response of a loudspeaker voice coil circuit to a current step of excitation. By sampling the damped sinusoidal transient generated by such an excitation, the loud-speaker parameters can be calculated from a linear predictive analysis of the recorded data.

40|$|Power-converters or {{amplifiers}} {{are required}} to drive high power piezoelectric transducers and attached processing equipment, at the optimum resonance mode for best processing efficacy, while under varying loading conditions. The driving power converter must synthesize relatively low-distortion sinusoidal output current to prevent harmonic-current excitation of neighbouring, less-productive or desirable resonant modes. Continuously-variable output-voltage capability is required to maintain output power at a level which optimises processing. Three output synthesis methods have been reviewed in this paper for the Class-D amplifier constituting the <b>transducer</b> <b>driver.</b> Typical output-waveform quality is assessed, and PSPICE simulation and laboratory results are presented to illustrate performance...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn order to function autonomously {{in the real}} world a mobile robot must first be able to sense the boundaries of it's operating space. Once the enclosing features and/or obstacles have been sensed they must be interpreted and represented in some way meaningful to the robot's controlling algorithms. The objective of this work is the development of a system of ultrasonic sensors, or sonars, for the mobile robot YAMABICO- 11 at the Naval Postgraduate School, and the implementation of a user friendly set of sonar language functions for the robot's control language MML. The sonar hardware includes twelve <b>transducer</b> pairs, their <b>drivers</b> and a bus mounted control card. The sonar control system operates autonomously under direction of the robot's central processor. Extraction of linear features is accomplished by the use of a least-square-fit algorithm of cartesian coordinate pairs to a parametric representation of the including line segment. [URL] U. S.

40|$|Three {{identical}} {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) sensor rings {{have been}} inserted in different locations of an ultrasonic wire bonding <b>transducer</b> <b>driver</b> {{in order to measure}} the bonding parameters. Voltage outputs from these three sensors were compared in order to find an optimal position for the sensor placement. One side of the PZT sensor ring is partially coated with a specially designed electrode pattern and the rings are only poled in this small region. With this specific electrode pattern, sensor resonance can be eliminated and the sensor has a flat frequency response. From the sensor signals, different bonding qualities can be distinguished. Hence, the transducer can provide a feedback for real-time bond quality control and thus can be called a ‘smart transducer’. The optimum position is found to be near the back of the transducer if second harmonic detection is used. By placing the sensor at this optimized position, an in situ automatic wire bonding process control system can be implemented. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{present a}} CMOS {{integrated}} <b>transducer</b> <b>driver</b> for high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) applications. Because this driver {{will be used}} in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment, no magnetic components such as inductors and transformers have been used in this design. The transducer is directly connected to the driver without a matching network. The output stage of this driver is a full-bridge Class DE RF amplifer which is able to deliver more power than the previous design that has a half-bridge Class DE amplifer. The driver was also designed to be used in a transducer array. A digital control unit was integrated with the power amplifer that allows to program the drivers phase shift and duty ratio. A strategy to drive a ultrasound transducer array using the designed driver is also presented in this thesis. This design was implemented using the AMS H 35 B 4 CMOS technology using the Cadence suite of design tools and occupies a die area of 2 mm by 1. 5 mm with 20 input and output pads. Simulation and initial experimental results are presented in this work. The proposed integrated CMOS driver has an efficiency of 89. 4 % with 3. 60 W of output power. Results are little bit different for each transducer...|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s the Ultrasonic Group at Michigan State University {{introduced}} light diffraction to study distortion of ultrasonic waves in liquids {{under the direction}} of Prof. Egon Hiedemann. In this paper some results of these studies will be presented with detailed description of the author's measurements of B/A. The rate at which the harmonics are developed (the wave distortion is an indication of the harmonics present) during the propagation of the initially sinusoidal ultrasonic wave depends on the nonlinearity of the medium. The light which is diffracted by the distorted wave results in asymmetric pattern contrary to the RamanNath theoretical prediction. From the light intensity measurements due to the generated second harmonics filtered out by a metal plate the nonlinearity parameter B/A was determined. Developments in studying finite amplitude standing ultrasonic waves in a liquid filled cavity will be also discussed. Using light diffraction measurements it was observed that above a threshold amplitude, fractional harmonics of the <b>driver</b> <b>transducer</b> are also generated in addition to the generated harmonics. It was recently observed that above a second threshold value of the driver amplitude the system undergoes chaotic behavior. Further increase of the driver amplitude returns the system from chaos to stable oscillation...|$|R
