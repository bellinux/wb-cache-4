40|$|We {{propose a}} new process for {{continuously}} reconjgurable robotics. Given a task, a robot evolves a suitable movhologv and control, then prints the assembled 30 structure, downloads into it andper$orms the task, and then recycles into a diflerent {{form for the}} next task. This approach relinquishes the need to adhere to discrete or fuced components as well as manually designed configurations. Although the technology forficlly realizing the proposed concept to is not entirely available, we have demonstrated a first case: Given the task of locomotion, various robots with direrent mechanics and control are evolved automatically. The design space is comprised of only linear actuators and sigmoidal control neurons embodied in an arbitrary <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>body.</b> The robots then print pre-assembled using rapid prototyping technology, and perform the task in reality. The robots are then recycled. This paper described one implementation and provides examples of successfil physical robots generated by the proposed process. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multilayer}} piezoelectric ceramic/polymer composite with 2 – 2 connectivity was fabricated by thermoplastic {{green machining}} after co-extrusion. The multilayer ceramic body {{was composed of}} piezoelectrically active lead zirconate titanate (PZN) –lead zinc niobate (PZN) -lead zirconate titanate (PZT) layers and electrically conducting PZN–PZT/Ag layers. After co-extrud-ing the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>body,</b> which consisted of five piezoelectric layers interspersed with four conducting layers, it was computer numeric-controlled machined to create periodic channels within it. Following binder burnout and sintering, an 18 vol % array of 190 lm thin PZT slabs with a channel size of 880 lm was fab-ricated. The channels were filled with epoxy in order to fabricate a PZN–PZT/epoxy composite with 2 – 2 connectivity. The pie-zoelectric coefficient (effective d 33) and hydrostatic figure of merit (dh gh) of the PZN–PZT/epoxy composite were 1200 pC/N and 20130 1015 m 2 /N, respectively. These excellent piezoelectric characteristics {{as well as the}} relatively simple fab-rication procedure will contribute in widening the application range of the piezoelectric transducers. I...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{components}} metallized by an ion-plating PVD-process on <b>thermoplastic</b> substrate <b>bodies</b> was {{the aim of}} {{this research}} project. Starting from the state-of-the-art, that polymers in industrial applications are mainly coated by galvanization, thermal evaporation or different combined processes with metallic or oxidic coatings we decided to use ion-plating processes to deposit multi-functional coatings on titanium basis. As substrate material different thermoplastic polymers were used (PBT, PA, PP, PC, ABS, [...] .). The components were designed for clean-room applications because of their low weight, flexible shape and wear resistant, electrical conductive surface. (orig.)

40|$|The halo body {{jacket and}} plaster Minerva body jacket {{have been the}} {{preferred}} orthoses when maximal stabilization of the cervical spine is required. This report identifies some disadvantages of these orthoses, introduces the <b>thermoplastic</b> Minerva <b>body</b> jacket (TMBJ), and discusses its advantages in the rehabilitation of patients with cervical spine instability. A preliminary roentgenographic {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the cervical spine motion of five male subjects wearing the TMBJ. The TMBJ, in addition to providing comparable cervical spine stability, offers several advantages over current methods of stabilization. Key Words: Cervical vertebrae, Orthopedics, Orthotic devices, Physical therapy. Many types of orthoses are prescribed for stabilization of the cervical spine. The degree of stabilization offered by these devices varies greatly. The halo body jacket and plaster Minerva body jacket have been used when maxima...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} the {{technology}} and the materials and processing issues of using plastics in vehicle body applications (structural and semistructural) were assessed. Plastics are significantly lighter in weight, more easily fabricated into complex shapes, and more corrosion resistance than sheet steel, high-strength steel, or aluminum. However, at their current stage of development, plastics are deficient {{in one or more}} necessary properties: heat resistance and dimensional stability, stiffness and tensile strength, toughness, and impact resistance. To upgrade their physical properties for automotive chassis/body applications, plastics need to be compounds with suitable reinforcing fibers. As a short-term approach, the material of choice is a composite structure made with low-cost glass-fiber reinforcement, such as that made in the resin-transfer-molding (RTM) process and used {{in the body of the}} Dodge Viper. However, RTM technology based on thermosets requires a processing cycle time that is too long for large production runs. Adaptation of RTM to the formation of <b>thermoplastic</b> composite <b>bodies</b> could have a significant advantage over thermoset technology. Cyclic oligomers, which are precursors to thermoplastic matrix polymers, show promise for this application. Farther on the horizon are advanced composites compounds with the much more expensive (but stronger and stiffer) carbon-fiber reinforcement. However, significant price reductions of precursor materials and advances in processing and fabrication would be needed. Other materials holding promise are liquid crystal polymers (LCP) and LCP blends with other polymers (molecular composites). However, the cost of monomers and the subsequent polymerization technology also remains a considerable drawback to the widespread and increasing acceptance of LCPs...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} neuroaxis irradiation {{for adults}} in the supine position using head <b>body</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> mask fixation, from the aspects of dose distribution, patient comfort and set-up accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine of the 12 adult patients were positioned for craniospinal axis irradiation in both prone and supine positions. After mask fixation and planning CTs in both positions, a questionnaire relating to the comfort was completed. The doses to the target and to the organs at risk of the 3 D conformal plans in the supine and prone positions were compared. Portal images of all 12 patients irradiated in the supine position were evaluated, the van Herk formulas being {{used to calculate the}} systemic and random errors. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the prone and supine positions target coverage, the dose homogeneity and the dose to the organs at risk. The supine position was considered more comfortable by the patients (scores of 2. 8 versus 4. 29), with a vector random error of 3. 27 mm, and a systematic error of 0. 32 mm. The largest random set-up error was observed in the lateral direction: 4. 83 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The more comfortable supine position is recommended for craniospinal irradiation in adult patients. Whole-body thermoplastic mask immobilization provides excellent repositioning accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This MEng (Master of Engineering) {{research}} thesis {{evaluates the}} capabilities {{and limitations of}} line-scan thermography for the non-destructive evaluation of composite structures containing hidden defects. In simple terms, line-scan thermography is a state-of-the-art technique in which a focused line of thermal energy is transmitted into a material. Line-scan thermography has great potential for the rapid and low cost non-destructive inspection of composite structures for aircraft, automobiles and ships. In this project, theoretical research exploring the heat transfer physics was undertaken in conjunction with experimental studies to develop an optimum inspection regime for line-scan thermography. The capability of line-scan thermography to detect impact damage in carbon/epoxy laminates was experimentally investigated in Chapter 3. From the impact side, in all materials, line-sc an thermography overestimated {{the size of the}} impact damage whereas flash thermography underestimated the size. There was a close relationship between the ultrasonic profile and the line-scan thermographic thermal response curve. New experimental data has been produced and analysed for the ability of line-scan thermography to determine the defect as well as the defect size. It was found that line-scan thermography was able to distinguish back drilled holes, but {{it was not possible to}} determine accurate defect sizing due to the depth of the holes from the inspected surface and the limitations associated with the line-scan thermographic apparatus itself. There was excellent correlation between the C-scan ultrasonics intensity curves and the line-scan thermographs as well as excellent correlation with the theoretical results. The relationship between line-scan thermography and foreign body objects were experimentally investigated for carbon/epoxy composites. A major limitation found with line-scan thermography is its limited depth penetration, which is highlighted in the foreign object study using 6 mm and 13 mm diameter Teflon® discs and 13 mm Teflon® strips embedded in carbon/epoxy laminates. Depth penetration allowed only 2 mm resolution for the 13 mm diameter discs and 1. 5 mm resolution for the 6 mm discs in a composite panel. The results of the investigation of stainless steel shim objects in carbon/epoxy laminates reveal that line-scan thermography is capable of determining their presence and size close to the surface. There was also excellent correlation between the ultrasonic response curve and the line-scan thermographic intensity curve. The results of the investigation of <b>thermoplastic</b> film foreign <b>body</b> objects in carbon/epoxy laminates show that at present line-scan thermography does not have the capability to determin e such defects. Experimental results show that line-scan thermography is capable of detecting large voids, back drilled holes, some foreign body objects, and impact damage. However, the ability of line-scan thermography to measure the defect dimensions is dependent on the size and type of damage, the distance from the line source, the depth of the defect, and the type of composite material...|$|R
