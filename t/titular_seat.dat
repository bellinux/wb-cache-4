2500|$|The seal of New York City, {{adopted in}} an earlier form in 1686, bears the legend SIGILLVM CIVITATIS NOVI EBORACI, which means simply [...] "The Seal of the City of New York". Eboracum was the Roman name for York, the <b>titular</b> <b>seat</b> of James II as Duke of York. The two {{supporters}} represent the unity between Native Americans and colonists, the four windmill sails recall the city's Dutch history as New Amsterdam, and the beavers and flour barrels the city's earliest trade goods (see History of New York City).

60|$|The {{revolution}} had all {{the character}} of a popular movement. Many of the high chiefs were detained in Mulinuu; the commons trooped to the bush under inferior leaders. A camp was chosen near Faleula, threatening Mulinuu, well placed for the arrival of recruits and close to a German plantation from which the force could be subsisted. Manono came, all Tuamasanga, much of Savaii, and part of Aana, Tamasese's own government and <b>titular</b> <b>seat.</b> Both sides were arming. It was a brave day for the trader, though not so brave as some that followed, when a single cartridge {{is said to have been}} sold for twelve cents currency--between nine and ten cents gold. Yet even among the traders a strong party feeling reigned, and it was the common practice to ask a purchaser upon which side he meant to fight.|$|E
50|$|The royal {{sites of}} Ireland {{served as the}} seats for the Gaelic kings of Ireland. Historical sources {{associate}} these sites with various medieval Irish kingdoms while archaeological investigations show that many royal sites were culturally significant thousands of years before recorded history. Ancient monuments, such as Neolithic burial mounds, standing stones, and cairns date back thousands of years and indicate the recurring—or even continuous—significance of these sites through millennia. The concept of a royal site goes back to medieval texts that describe these places as the <b>titular</b> <b>seats</b> of Irish kings where assemblies, athletic games, and inaugurations were held.|$|R

50|$|In 1877, {{he married}} his first wife, Lady Flora Hastings. He later wrote, 'Shortly after my most happy marriage, I wished {{to build a}} church as a thank-offering to God.' To commemorate this occasion, he {{undertook}} construction of a church in his <b>titular</b> ancestral <b>seat</b> in Norwich, Norfolk. After commencing in 1882 with a gift of £200,000, construction would not be completed until 1910, nearly 23 years after Lady Flora's death in 1887. This church was also later chosen to serve as St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich when the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia was re-established in 1976.|$|R

5000|$|Manuel I, surnamed Sarantenos or Charitopoulos (Μανουήλ Α΄ Σαραντηνός or Χαριτόπουλος), was Patriarch of Constantinople from December 1216 or January 1217 to 1222. He {{seems to}} have been called [...] "the Philosopher": George Akropolites says he was [...] "a philosopher, it seems, in deed, and so named by the people." [...] Manuel was Patriarch-in-exile as at the time his <b>titular</b> <b>seat</b> was {{occupied}} by the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, and he resided in Nicaea. Before the sack of 1204, Manuel was a deacon and hypatos ton philosophon in Constantinople. This is likely the source of his epithet [...] "the Philosopher".|$|E
50|$|The Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem was a Catholic {{military}} order {{founded by}} crusaders around 1119 at a leper hospital in Jerusalem, Kingdom of Jerusalem, whose care became its original purpose, named after patron saint Lazarus. It was recognised by King Fulk of Jerusalem in 1142 and canonically recognised as hospitaller and military order of chivalry under therule of Saint Augustine in the Papal bull Cum a Nobis Petitur of Pope Alexander IV in 1255. The <b>titular</b> <b>seat</b> was successively situated at Jerusalem, Saint-Jean-d'Acre and - {{after the fall}} of the Kingdom of Jerusalem - split in two main branches in Italy and in Château Royal de Boigny-sur-Bionne in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{seat of the}} Upper Towns was at Ustanali (near Calhoun, Georgia). It {{was also}} the <b>titular</b> <b>seat</b> of the nation, with former warriors James Vann and his protégés, The Ridge (formerly known as Pathkiller) and Charles R. Hicks—the Cherokee Triumvirate—their leaders (particularly of the younger, more-acculturated generation). The leaders of these towns were the most progressive, favoring acculturation, formal {{education}} and modern farming methods. Cherokee settlements in the highlands of western North Carolina, known as the Hill Towns with their seat at Quallatown, and the lowland Valley Towns (with their seat at Tuskquitee) were more traditional. So was the Upper Town of Etowah, inhabited mainly by full-bloods and the nation's largest town.|$|E
5000|$|Maximus II was Patriarch of Constantinople from June to December 1216. He {{had been}} abbot {{of the monastery}} of the Akoimetoi and was the confessor of the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris before he became patriarch. George Akropolites and Xanthopoulos are highly {{critical}} of Maximos, suggesting that he was [...] "uneducated" [...] {{and that the only}} reason he was made patriarch was his intrigue into the palace's women's quarters. Akropolites writes that he [...] "paid court to the women's quarters and was in turn courted by it; for it was nothing else which raised him to such eminence." [...] Maximus was Patriarch-in-exile as at the time his <b>titular</b> <b>seat</b> was occupied by the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, and he resided in Nicaea. He died in office after only six months on the patriarchal throne.|$|E
