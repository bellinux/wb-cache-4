50|$|In 1878, the Bell Telephone Company {{began to}} use <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> (called the local loop) from each user's {{telephone}} to end offices which performed any necessary electrical switching to allow voice signals to be transmitted to more distant telephones.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{interface}} standards between analog {{telephone central office}} equipment and customer-premises equipment. Single voice paths generally include analog audio connections, either a <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> or four-wire circuit plus signaling paths to indicate call progress and status information, such as ringing, answer supervision, etc. Some of the known interface types are ...|$|E
50|$|Pantographs are the {{successor}} technology to trolley poles, which were widely used on early streetcar systems. Trolley poles are still used by trolleybuses, whose {{freedom of movement}} and need for a <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> makes pantographs impractical, and some streetcar networks, such as the Toronto streetcar system, which have frequent turns sharp enough to require additional freedom of movement in their current collection to ensure unbroken contact. However, many of these networks, including Toronto's, are undergoing upgrades to accommodate pantograph operation.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a {{four-wire}} circuit is a two-way circuit using two paths so arranged that the respective signals are transmitted {{in one direction}} only by one path {{and in the other}} direction by the other path. Late in the 20th century, almost all connections between telephone exchanges were {{four-wire circuit}}s, while conventional phone lines into residences and businesses were <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Using a long, {{flexible}} {{test cable}} {{connected with a}} one-wire voltage feedback circuit, a resistive tactile sensor in a shared row-column fashion exhibited flexibility in robotic operations but suffered from crosstalk caused by the connected cable due to its wire resistances and its contacted resistances. Firstly, we designed a new non-scanned driving-electrode (VF-NSDE) circuit using two wires for every row line and every column line to reduce the crosstalk caused by the connected cables in the circuit. Then, an equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) for the <b>two-wire</b> VF-NSDE <b>circuit</b> was analytically derived. Following this, the one-wire VF-NSDE <b>circuit</b> and the <b>two-wire</b> VF-NSDE <b>circuit</b> were evaluated by simulation experiments. Finally, positive features of the proposed method were verified with the experiments of a <b>two-wire</b> VF-NSDE prototype <b>circuit.</b> The experiment {{results show that the}} <b>two-wire</b> VF-NSDE <b>circuit</b> can greatly reduce the crosstalk error caused by the cables in the 2 -D networked resistive sensor array...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} tone {{remote system}} uses a <b>two-wire</b> audio <b>circuit</b> {{to operate a}} simplex base station. If simultaneous transmit and receive is required, a four-wire or full duplex audio path to the base station is required. Systems using diversity combining (voting) require four-wire circuits.|$|R
50|$|In these cases, {{the purpose}} of the star quad {{configuration}} is reversed. The star-quad geometry cancels the magnetic fields that are produced by the two pairs of conductors. This cancellation reduces the magnetic emissions of the cable. To work properly, the cable must be wired in the same fashion as the microphone cable example above. Wires {{on opposite sides of the}} star must be shorted together at each end of the cable. This means that 4 conductors are required for a <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit.</b> Furthermore, this scheme only works if the two pairs of conductors carry equal and opposite currents.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{characterized}} by supporting transmission in two directions simultaneously, as opposed to four-wire circuits, which have separate pairs for transmit and receive. In either case they are twisted pairs. Telephone lines are almost all two wire, while trunks and switching are almost entirely four wire. To communicate in both directions in the same wire pair, conversion between four-wire and two-wire is necessary, both at the telephone and at the central office. A hybrid coil accomplishes the conversion for both. At the central office, {{it is part of}} a four-wire terminating set, more often as part of a line card.|$|E
50|$|The {{side of the}} {{transformer}} {{facing the}} line, in a good quality design, will have the winding laid in two parts (often with a centre tap provided) which are carefully balanced to maintain the line balance. Line side and equipment side windings are more useful concepts than the more usual primary and secondary windings when discussing these kinds of transformers. At the sending end the line side winding is the secondary, but at the receiving end the line side winding is the primary. When discussing a <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> primary and secondary cease to have any meaning at all, since signals are flowing in both directions at once.|$|E
50|$|Most {{automated}} {{telephone exchanges}} use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The trunks connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuits</b> are still used {{to connect the}} last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical {{phone call from a}} calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.|$|R

50|$|Hybrid: The hybrid {{function}} involves <b>two-wire</b> to four-wire <b>circuit</b> conversions. This {{was originally}} {{performed by a}} hybrid transformer (induction coil) but has largely been superseded by DSP devices.|$|R
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone hybrid coil (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same <b>two-wire</b> <b>circuit</b> to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|E
50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} variants that support R2 {{line signalling}} in its electrical-pulse form by dedicated <b>two-wire</b> or four-wire <b>circuits</b> usually represent each signal as two different pulse lengths (e.g., 150 milliseconds versus 600 milliseconds), {{where the two}} different meanings of those two different pulse lengths varies by context.|$|R
50|$|SDLC {{operates}} independently on each communications link, and {{can operate}} on point-to-pointmultipointor loop facilities, on switched or dedicated, <b>two-wire</b> or four-wire <b>circuits,</b> and with full-duplex and half-duplex operation.A unique characteristic of SDLC {{is its ability}} to mix half-duplex secondary stations with full-duplex primary stations on four-wire circuits, thus reducing the cost of dedicated facilities.|$|R
50|$|R2 line {{signalling}} {{is a family}} of protocols that govern the resource acquisition and resource release related to a two-party telephone call attempt and, if successful, {{the establishment of a}} two-party telephone call. Although in the 1960s R2 {{line signalling}} was represented as electrical pulses on a <b>two-wire</b> or four-wire <b>circuit,</b> by the latter 1970s these analog electrical pulses also could be represented in digital form by a signalling DS0 channel in the trunk, which is normally channel 16 in an E1 trunk.|$|R
