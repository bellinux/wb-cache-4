Initially he has appeared to come close to an admission, saying in 1992, [...] "in December 1970, I signed three or four documents" [...] to escape from the secret police. In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope, Wałęsa said, [...] "It is also the truth <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> left that clash completely pure. They gave me a condition: signature! And then I signed." [...] He denies he acted upon the collaboration agreement. However, in his later years Wałęsa said all the documents are forgeries and told BBC in 2008, [...] "you will not find any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere".|$|E

In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

In 1774, he founded the [...] "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", {{in order to help}} the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still regret <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> given it to him by inoculation.

In the July Edinburgh Review a lengthy and scathing attack by Adam Sedgwick, who had taught Darwin geology at university, predicted [...] "ruin and confusion in such a creed" [...] which if {{taken up by the}} populace would [...] "undermine the whole moral and social fabric" [...] bringing [...] "discord and deadly mischief in its train." [...] On 8 October Darwin wrote telling Lyell that the review was [...] "far from popular with non-scientific readers. I think some few passages savour of the dogmatism of the pulpit, rather than of the philosophy of the Professor chair". Nevertheless, it was [...] "a grand piece of argument against mutability of species; & I read it with fear & trembling, but was well pleased to find, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> overlooked any of the arguments, though I had put them to myself as feebly as milk & water." ...|$|E

Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, [...] "I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI.

2500|$|Publishers Weekly called American Spy a [...] "breezy, unrepentant memoir" [...] and {{described}} it as a [...] "nostalgic memoir [...] breaks scant new ground in an already crowded field". Tim Rutten of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a bitter and self-pitying memoir" [...] and [...] "offers a rather standard account of how men of his generation became involved in intelligence work". [...] Referencing the book's title, Tim Weiner of The New York Times wrote: [...] "American Spy is presented as a 'secret history,' a double-barreled misrepresentation. There are no real secrets in this book. As history it is bunk." [...] Weiner said that the author's examination of the Kennedy assassination was the low-point of the book, indicating that Hunt pretended to take various conspiracy theories, including the involvement of former President Johnson, seriously. He concluded his review describing it as a work [...] "in a long tradition of errant nonsense" [...] and [...] "a book to shun". Joseph C. Goulden of The Washington Times {{described it as}} a [...] "true mess of a book" [...] and dismissed Hunt's allegations against Johnson as [...] "fantasy". Goulden summarized his review: [...] "I wish now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> read this pathetic book. Avoid it." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, you have to remember <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy {{told me that she had}} no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...|$|E
