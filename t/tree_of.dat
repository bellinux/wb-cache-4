40|$|Summary Reforestation with provenances from {{locations}} {{remote from}} the planting site (transferred provenances) or the progeny <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> local provenances selected for superior form and vigor (plus trees) offer alternative means to increase yield over that obtained {{by the use of}} seed from unselected <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the local provenance. Under Swedish conditions, Nor-way spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) of certain transferred provenances generally has an advantage in productivity rela-tive to the local provenance comparable to that of progeny <b>of</b> plus <b>trees.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to explore the extent to which productivity gains achieved by provenance transfer or the use <b>of</b> plus <b>tree</b> progeny are associated with reductions in autumn frost hardiness, relative to that <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the local provenance. In a field trial with 19 -year-old trees in central Sweden, bud hardiness was tested on four occasions during the autumn <b>of</b> 2002. <b>Trees</b> <b>of</b> the local provenance were compared with <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> a south Swedish provenance originating 3 ° of lati-tude to the south, a Belarusian provenance and the progeny <b>of</b> plus <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> local origin. The Belarusian provenance was the least hardy and the local provenance the most hardy, with plus tree progeny and the south Swedish provenance being interme-diate in hardiness. Both the Belarusian provenance and the plus tree progeny were significantly taller than <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the other populations. Within provenances, tree height was negatively correlated with autumn frost hardiness. Among the plus tree progeny, however, no such correlation between tree height and autumn frost hardiness was found. It is concluded that although the gain in productivity achieved by provenance transfer from Belarus was comparable to that achieved by using the progeny <b>of</b> plus <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the local provenance, the use <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> the Belarus provenance involved an increased risk of autumn frost damage because of later hardening...|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E

40|$|Diurnal {{courses in}} gas exchange, {{photochemical}} efficiency and water relations were monitored during two late summers in {{three groups of}} adult Quercus robur L. trees, planted along an urbanization gradient that correlated positively with the degree of die-back exhibited by the trees.

All three groups <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> showed a significant correlation of net photosynthesis with photon flux density (PPFD), but A correlated more positively with the pre-dawn leaf water potential ψpd <b>of</b> the moderately (<b>trees</b> <b>of</b> group b, i. e. at the edge of town) and severely (<b>trees</b> <b>of</b> group c, i. e. urban) water-stressed <b>trees.</b> A <b>of</b> the rural <b>trees</b> and stomatal conductance (g) of the three groups <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> showed little correlation ψpd values. Possibly due to the long-term effect of stress, g, as reflected by changes in the transpiration rate (E), showed a significantly (p ≤ 0. 01) higher sensitivity to relative ambient humidity (RH) in the <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> groups b and c. Photochemically, a close coupling was found to exist between A, ψpd, RH, the time needed to reach the maximum fluorescence level, i. e.

5|$|In {{northern}} Europe the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven was {{not considered}} naturalised in cities until after the Second World War. This {{has been attributed to}} the tree's ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow. In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas (it is thought that the tree requires a mean annual temperature of 8 degrees Celsius to grow well, which limits its spread to more northern and higher altitude areas). For example, one study in Germany found the <b>tree</b> <b>of</b> heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether. In other areas of Europe {{this is not the case}} as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish.
