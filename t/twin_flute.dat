The music and dance that characterize the festival is called a sanjuanito. The bandolines and the guitars mark the 2/4 tempo of the sanjuanito rhythm, which is accentuated by the bombo, and the quenas, rondador, and violins carry the melody.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{regional}} {{names of}} bansuri-style, {{six to eight}} play holes, bamboo flutes in India include bansi, eloo, kulal, kulalu, kukhl, lingbufeniam, murali, murli, nadi, nar, pawa, pullankuzhal, pillana grovi, pulangoil, vansi, vasdanda, and venuvu. Ancient regional innovations, {{such as those in}} the Himalayan foothills of India, developed more complex designs, such as the algoza which is a [...] "twin bansuri" [...] in different keys constructed as a single instrument, allowing the musician to play more complex music. In central and south India, a similar innovation is called nagoza or mattiyaan jodi, and Buddhist stupa reliefs in central India, from about the 1st century BCE, depict the single and <b>twinned</b> <b>flute</b> designs.|$|R
5000|$|On [...] "The Day Before You Came", for {{the first}} time in ABBA's history, Benny was the only person to play instruments. He built up the music from a click track template, {{something}} which he later said [...] "was probably not a good idea", despite his liking the track. The entire backing track of the song was put together in the studio, [...] "initially consisting of a single melodic fragment that lent itself to being repeated in a series of ascending and descending phrases over several key changes". The production is minimalist, featuring only [...] "the GX-1, a snare drum, and a few licks of acoustic guitar". While the song has [...] "long, sustained block chords" [...] - a [...] "given" [...] for ABBA songs, it also has [...] "a liberal smattering of percussive synth effects". An example is the [...] "carefree", [...] "spontaneous", and [...] "conversational" [...] synthetic <b>twin</b> <b>flutes,</b> which begin their [...] "integral role in the soundscape by offering regular bouts of whimsical reassurance" [...] at the very start of the track. These 'flutes' are [...] "arguably song's signature sound". Their riff [...] "smooths out a series of sustained chordal layers" [...] in the refrains, aided by the backing vocals.|$|R
50|$|Count Konstantin Konstantinovich Pahlen, {{during his}} travels {{through the area}} in 1908 and 1909, {{described}} such dances, and commissioned photographs of the dancers:Cushions and rugs were fetched, on which we gratefully reclined, great carpets were spread over the court, the natives puffed at their narghiles, politely offering them to us, and the famous Khivan bachehs made their entrance. Backstage, an orchestra mainly composed of <b>twin</b> <b>flutes,</b> kettle drums, {{and half a dozen}} man-sized silver trumpets took up its stand. Opposite us a door left slightly ajar led to the harem quarters. We caught a glimpse of flashing eyes as the inmates thronged to the door to have a good look at us and watch the performance.The orchestra started up with a curious, plaintive melody, the rhythm being taken up and stressed by the kettle drums, and four bachehs took up their positions on the carpet. The bachehs are young men specially trained to perform a particular set of dances. Barefoot, and dressed like women in long, brightly coloured silk smocks reaching below their knees and narrow trousers fastened tightly round their ankles, their arms and hands sparkle with rings and bracelets. They wear their hair long, reaching below the shoulders, though the front part of the head is clean shaven. The nails of the hands and feet are painted red, the eyebrows are jet black and meet over the bridge of the nose. The dances consist of sensuous contortions of the body and a rhythmical pacing to and fro, with the hands and arms raised in a trembling movement. As the ballet proceeded the number of dancers increased, the circle grew in size, the music waxed shriller and shriller and the eyes of the native onlookers shone with admiration, while the bachehs intoned a piercing melody in time with the ever-growing tempo of the music. The Heir explained that they were chanting of love and the beauty of women. Swifter and swifter moved the dancers till they finally sank to the floor, seemingly exhausted and enchanted by love. They were followed by others, but the general theme was usually the same.|$|R
