5|$|In July 2009 <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> {{determined}} {{that the company was}} insolvent. With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the land on which they were being grown was yet to be sold.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> {{granted a}} two-year {{exclusivity}} period to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung. After striking {{deals with the}} previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped {{in return for their}} agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership, <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> released a document in June 2016 setting out a timescale for the company restructure, share relisting and takeover, to be completed by the end of October. It confirmed that Suen would hold 60.78% of BIH shares and the Yeung faction no more than 14%, and that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed on 17 October, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.|$|E
5000|$|For a <b>receiver,</b> <b>the</b> attack-time {{delay is}} defined as the time {{interval}} from the instant a step radio-frequency (RF) signal, at a level equal to <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> threshold of sensitivity, is applied to <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> input, to <b>the</b> instant when <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> output amplitude reaches 90% of its steady-state value.

50|$|The Model 24 uses {{a barrel}} {{tightening}} method (needed {{due to the}} takedown nature of the design in which the barrel can be separated from <b>the</b> <b>receiver)</b> that {{is very close to}} that of the Browning SA-22. That tightening method uses an adjusting ring on {{the lower end of the}} barrel where it presses up against <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> Model 241 uses a different method of tightening the barrel to <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> (a dual-sided nut with an interrupted-screw threading rides inside the opening in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and, by selecting how deeply the nut sits in <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> it controls how tightly the barrel fits against <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> when <b>the</b> barrel is fitted to <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> This mechanism of the Model 241 is not visible unless the barrel is separated from <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> so that <b>the</b> opening in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> can be viewed).|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{transmitting}} {{data from a}} sender to a receiver over a channel.

The method further includes receiving a first reservation CSS from <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> signaling that <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> has reserved <b>the</b> channel {{in order to receive}} the data from the sender. In response to receiving the first reservation CSS, transmitting the data to <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> and receiving an acknowledgment CSS from <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> signaling that <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> has received <b>the</b> data from the sender...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>receivers</b> {{are based}} on Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, with low noise {{amplifiers}} cooled to 15K, which have 20GHz bandwidths and provide 46dB of amplification. The signals are mixed with a local oscillator to reduce their frequency, prior to correlation with an analog correlator. The system temperatures are between 55 and 75K.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower {{at the base of the}} telescope to change <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch into the top of the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E
5|$|After 1223, Jocelin was a baron of the exchequer. In 1225 {{he served}} the king {{as head of}} one of <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> of the tax of a fifteenth. After the {{dismissal}} of Walter Mauclerk as treasurer, at first Jocelin, along with Richard Poore, the Bishop of Durham, took over many of the treasurers functions, but this did not last long, and after 1233, Jocelin no longer was involved with financial affairs. He occasionally witnessed charters, however. After the fall of Peter des Roches in April 1234, Jocelin was given control of the Wardrobe. After this, he appears less regularly in royal government, but he did witness the reconfirmation of Magna Carta in 1237.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>receiver</b> {{attempts}} to decode the received packet. If {{it can be}} decoded, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> sends an acknowledgment back to the transmitter. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> asks <b>the</b> transmitter to send the packet again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distance}} between a satellite navigation receiver and a satellite {{can be calculated}} from {{the time it takes}} for a signal to travel from the satellite to <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> To calculate <b>the</b> delay, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> must align a pseudorandom binary sequence contained in the signal to an internally generated pseudorandom binary sequence. Since the satellite signal takes time to reach <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> <b>the</b> satellite's sequence is delayed in relation to <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> sequence. By increasingly delaying <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> sequence, <b>the</b> two sequences are eventually aligned.|$|R

5|$|Gernsback {{was slow}} to pay his authors and creditors; {{the extent of his}} {{investments}} limited his liquidity. On 20 February 1929 his printer and paper supplier opened bankruptcy proceedings against him. It has been suggested that Bernarr Macfadden, another magazine publisher, maneuvered to force the bankruptcy because Gernsback would not sell his titles to Macfadden, but this is unproven. Experimenter Publishing did not file any defence and was declared bankrupt by default on 6 March 1929; Amazing survived with its existing staff, but Hugo and his brother, Sidney, were forced out as directors. Arthur H. Lynch took over as editor-in-chief, though Sloane continued to have effective control of the magazine's contents. <b>The</b> <b>receivers,</b> Irving Trust, sold the magazine to Bergan A. Mackinnon on 3 April 1929.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{spent seven}} years working at his {{business}} in Ruston after leaving the Browns. He worked briefly as a special instructor for the Houston Oilers and an occasional advisor to college programs in Louisiana, but otherwise was out of football. He returned to the Browns as an assistant coach, however, in March 1963 after Paul Brown was fired by team owner Art Modell. Blanton Collier, Brown's long-time deputy, became head coach and put Jones in charge of <b>the</b> <b>receivers.</b> Jones and Collier had been close during his playing days, and Collier considered him an astute student of the game.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{starting}} a pool session, the provider meets with <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{to fill out}} paperwork, answer questions, review referrals and records, and discuss needs, expectations, and health condition. <b>The</b> <b>receiver</b> is fitted with floats around the upper shins or lower thighs to prevent the legs from sinking. The session starts with <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> seated or crouched at the pool edge. The provider faces <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> coordinates breathing, and then gently draws <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> into a back floating position called [...] "first position".|$|R
30|$|The {{frequency}} hopping provision presents {{a problem for}} <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> design. In a normal RFID system, the reader transmitter and receiver are integrated inside the reader, and <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> knows <b>the</b> frequency at which the transmitter sent the signal. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is decoupled from the transmitter, so <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> must have knowledge of the transmitter’s channel frequency.|$|R
5|$|On 19 March 2001, Tillingbourne {{abruptly}} ceased {{operations and}} {{was placed in}} the hands of receivers Begbies Traynor. This followed two years in which the company had lost around £450,000. <b>The</b> <b>receivers</b> blamed the losses on increasing costs, low subsidies from local councils and falling passenger numbers. The closure left 140 staff unemployed and caused large numbers of passengers to be stranded. Replacement services were organised by Surrey County Council and four bus operators, with the majority of routes being covered within days by temporary contracted services. Some schoolchildren were forced to find other means of transport, although workings on routes 62 and 63 were covered by Aventa Transport.|$|E
5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. <b>The</b> <b>receivers</b> announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were again}} in {{financial}} difficulties, and in June 1983, Martin called in <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> {{and the club}} was put up for sale. A Save Bradford City Fund was launched on 24 July, and former chairman Stafford Heginbotham and former board member Jack Tordoff bought the club, forming a new company, and enabling the team to start the new league campaign. Centre forward Bobby Campbell was sold to Derby County to balance the books and John Hawley brought in as his replacement. City struggled on the pitch and won just one of their first 15games leaving them in the relegation zone. Campbell had played just 11games during four months with Derby and so he returned to Bradford initially on a loan transfer. His return coincided with a club record ten successive league victories. Campbell finished the season with nine goals, Hawley with 22, but City finished seventh and missed out on promotion.|$|E

50|$|Typically the {{transmitter}} adds a redundancy check number {{to the end}} of each frame. <b>The</b> <b>receiver</b> uses <b>the</b> redundancy check number to check for possible damage. If <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> sees that <b>the</b> frame is good, it sends an ACK. If <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> sees that <b>the</b> frame is damaged, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> discards it and does not send an ACK—pretending that the frame was completely lost, not merely damaged.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{effects of}} large scale fading, the {{amplitude}} of SNR depends on {{distance between the}} transmitter and <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> It is obvious that SNR is usually high when <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{is close to the}} transmitter; while it is low when <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is far away from the transmitter. As a result, the transition probability from the high channel state to the low channel state is different when <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is near or far away from the transmitter, which means that the Markov state transition probability is related to the location of <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> Therefore, only one state transition probability matrix, which is independent of the location of <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> may not accurately model the channels.|$|R
2500|$|In {{scenario}} (a), {{when the}} source {{is closest to}} <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> <b>the</b> light hitting <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> actually comes from a direction where the source had been some time back, {{and it has a}} significant longitudinal component, making an analysis from the frame of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> tricky.
