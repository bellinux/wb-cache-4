5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> the album as a band project.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories on how best <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> and define the nature of language {{based on data from}} the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E

Words are created around object-agent, according to Yaska, to express external or internal reality perceived by man, and are one of six modifications of Kriya (action) and Bhava (dynamic being), namely being born, existing, changing, increasing, decreasing and perishing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article compares {{a variety}} of {{theoretical}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>conceptualizing</b> institutional change. Our goal is neither to discover the “best ” theory, nor to attempt {{to build a new}} one. Rather, we wish to compare how the theories we consider agree or differ with respect to the causes, process, and outcomes of institutional change. Some of the theories we discuss emphasize the deliberate creation of institutions through the political process, while others emphasize the spontaneous emergence of institutions through evolutionary processes. Still others combine elements of evolution and design. We differentiate {{a variety of}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>conceptualizing</b> the interaction between formal and informal rules. We discuss recent theories based on the “Equilibrium View” of institutions, and theories emphasizing the role of habit, learning and bounded rationality.

First, {{they agreed that}} their work is largely inspired by North, Wallis and Weingast's work but explained that they build on and complement each other's work. Second, {{with reference to the}} criticism of oversimplification, they countered by describing the oversimplification as an approach to decompose complex political institutions; that it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> and to avoid focusing too narrowly on a single aspect of institutions. Last, on China, they attribute the rapid economic growth in China to the some (but yet limited) level of inclusiveness, as was also seen in the example of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|A schema is a cognitively {{organized}} {{network of}} associations that {{is readily available}} to help guide an individual’s perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as “girls are weak and boys are strong,” classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed basic knowledge on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In order words, the child learns {{the contents of the}} society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.|$|E
25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E

The decision to focus on the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope helped energize the design team.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article elaborates one {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>conceptualizing</b> and investigating international processes of education policy formation (IPEPF), which are dynamic, multi-level and processual in nature. This contribution is important because, although research is increasingly conducted on phenomena with such characteristics, extended discussions {{of how these}} processes are either conceptualized or researched are rare. This article engages with both issues. With regard to the latter, the article adapts and tailors to the phenomena of IPEPF a range of qualitative methodological strategies suggested by Miles and Huberman, and by Yin. In this article, I discuss {{a number of issues}} related <b>to</b> <b>conceptualizing</b> and conducting research on what I term international processes of education policy formation (IPEPF, defined below). The purpose is to elaborate on the conceptual dimensions and methodological strategies related to undertaking research on policy production processes that include action across multiple levels (e. g. international, national, local) and among multiple types of actors (e. g. international development institutions, national policymakers and local program staff). Thus, the contribution of this article, and of the four articles in this issue of RCIE generally, is not that it presents findings on the outcomes of such research, but rather that it presents {{one approach}} <b>to</b> <b>conceptualizing</b> and investigating policy formation processes that are dynamic, multi-level and processual. Such a contribution is important because, although scholars increasingly conduct research on such phenomena, extended discussions of how these processes are conceptualized and researched are rare.

500|$|Controversy has {{occurred}} over airport ownership before. When {{a transfer of}} ownership {{to the city of}} Penticton was planned, effective March31, 1999, the Penticton Indian Band protested at the airfield on that same day; this forced three scheduled flights to be canceled. Members of the band stated that the land belonged to them, noted they would [...] "never relinquish claim to the airport lands", and expected the airport's ownership to be transferred to them after World War I and World War II. They attempted <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> a different agreement, but Transport Canada suggested the band's claims should be ignored, as it is not a proper government. In response, the Penticton Indian Band blocked road entrance to the airport, and terminal. Transport Canada later announced a six-week break from the ownership situation, and a runway-paving project was placed on hiatus. Based on a suggestion from the Penticton City Council, it was later decided that, if the Penticton Regional Airport be closed, the land may be returned to them, although Transport Canada was against this. , the airport is owned and operated by Transport Canada.|$|E
500|$|Darren Bridges, a {{developer}} for Sucker Punch, {{noted that they}} wanted to make Infamous about [...] "becoming a modern-day superhero", stressing the word [...] "becoming" [...] as the key motivator to show the growth of Cole from a simple bike messenger to someone with god-like powers. This led to instilling a [...] "sense of progress" [...] and growth of the character in all aspects of the game including the story, the progression of the player's powers, and the variation and difficulty in the enemies that the player faced. The team initially brainstormed on what powers that the lead character had, but selected electricity-based powers for two primary reasons. First, the power translated well to a video game context, as it would be easy <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> the aspects of electrical-based powers in terms of video game concepts such as ranged combat. Secondly, electrical-based powers could then be tied to the city that the player would explore, requiring the player to use the city's electricity as fuel, and thus developing a [...] "real relationship with the city".|$|E

It was arduous for Miller <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality.

[...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!'

500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill {{grew up in}} Fullerton, California. She is {{the fifth}} of seven children; {{her mother was a}} dental {{hygienist}} and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls [...] "had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling [...] "resistant to rules", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: [...] "My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls—the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability <b>to</b> <b>conceptualize</b> a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.|$|E
