5|$|According to this Upanishad, the renouncer pilgrim {{undertakes}} <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> {{the knowledge}} of Brahman with purity of thought, without belongings, with his head shaved, wearing discoloured garments, free from enmity towards all, and he lives on alms. This method is not essential for anyone too sick or in mortal danger – such a person may renounce verbally or mentally.|$|E

5|$|On {{its way to}} the Museum of Flight in November 2003, G-BOAG set a New York City-to-Seattle speed {{record of}} 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds.

5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> India, {{the family}} stopped at Madeira, St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope.

5|$|The first Type UBI {{to enter}} service was UB-10, which formed {{the nucleus of}} the Flanders Flotilla, on 27 March 1915. By the end of April five more Type UBI boats had become operational. UB-10 was {{eventually}} joined in the Flanders Flotilla by UB-2, UB-4, UB-5, UB-6, UB-12, UB-13, UB-16, and UB-17; of these, only UB-2 made <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Flanders by sea rather than rail.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed and had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Jeremiah as Lavanya Chandramouli, the estranged {{daughter}} of Chandramouli, who also embarks on <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> find her father.

She also becomes a love interest for Muthu. Andrea Jeremiah, like Karthi, appears in her second major role for the film, also singing parts of two songs which appear in the soundtrack. During the making of the film news websites linked Andrea with the director, Selvaraghavan, albeit to the pair's displeasure.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E

5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective tow to the dismasted French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make one}} last show of defiance, Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas at low tide and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> India.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|In January 1099 on <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem {{during the}} First Crusade, {{the company of}} Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the {{garrison}} of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February {{of the same year}} but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.|$|E
5|$|In early 1798, after 14 {{months in}} Paris, Surcouf took command of Clarisse, a 14-gun {{privateer}} brig armed with four 12-pounders, ten 8-pounders, and manned by a 120-strong complement. He departed from Paimboeuf, Nantes, in February 1798, {{this time with}} a proper lettre de marque. During <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> Isle de France, Clarisse chased a British slave ship, which escaped after one of her shots cut off Clarisse 's foremast tops. Surcouf captured a British brig South of Cape of Good Hope, which surrendered at the warning shot, on which he sent a prize crew under Captain Dujardin, and arrived La Réunion on 5 December.|$|E
60|$|Amazed as he was, his amazement {{would have}} been deeper had he been told the truth: {{that there was not}} a single buccaneer or a single gun ashore on Palomas. The {{deception}} had been complete. Don Miguel could not guess that the men he had beheld in those piraguas were always the same; that on <b>the</b> <b>journeys</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore they sat and stood upright in full view; and that on <b>the</b> <b>journeys</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ships, they lay invisible at the bottom of the boats, which were thus made to appear empty.|$|R

5|$|Inman's health had {{suffered}} during his long career at sea, {{and although he}} returned to sea in December 1805 aboard Triumph during the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{as part of the}} squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan, his ill-health forced his replacement by Sir Thomas Hardy in May. Returning to his family ashore, Inman was initially given command of the sea fencibles at King's Lynn before he was made Admiralty commissioner at Madras by Lord Mulgrave in 1809. <b>The</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> India broke his health completely and he died on 15 July 1809, just ten days after arriving in Madras.|$|E
5|$|Louis Stanislas {{travelled}} more through France {{than other}} members of the royal family, who rarely left the Île-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while they were taking the waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.|$|E
5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not attend for a second day's racing, they asked all the other guests not to interrupt the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During <b>the</b> <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E
