5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of the war <b>the</b> <b>remnants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 366th Independent Infantry Battalion were pursued by Australian Army patrols, air attacks and groups of local Dayaks {{organised}} by the Australian Services Reconnaissance Department.

However, the forces involved suffered heavy casualties, with 50 percent of the 367th Battalion's soldiers being killed between 10 June and the end of the war. The 369th and 370th Independent Infantry Battalions did not see combat, and remained largely intact at the end of the war.
