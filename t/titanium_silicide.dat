However, the p-type typically has a much lower forward voltage. As the reverse leakage current increases dramatically with lowering the forward voltage, it can not be too low, so the usually employed range is about 0.5-0.7 V, and p-type semiconductors are employed only rarely. <b>Titanium</b> <b>silicide</b> and other refractory silicides, which are able to withstand the temperatures needed for source/drain annealing in CMOS processes, usually have too low a forward voltage to be useful, so processes using these silicides therefore usually do not offer Schottky diodes.|$|E

This paper reports on a comprehensive analysis of <b>titanium</b> <b>silicide</b> thin films by a variety of spectroscopy, diffraction and microscopy techniques. The composition and uniformity of the thin films and the oxygen contamination in the thin films is studied using Auger electron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry; these have highlighted the existence of a thin film of uniform and desired composition, with a layer of oxide on the surface.

40|$|The {{aerospace}} {{as well as}} {{the automotive}} industry permanently intend to reduce the weight of applied structural materials. Therefore, γ-TiAl is an attractive material fulfilling that requirement due to its low mass density, generally, and good mechanical properties in the temperature range between 700 °C and 900 °C. However, application of titanium aluminides above 750 °C service temperature is limited by poor oxidation behaviour caused by formation of fast growing and porous titania. To decrease the oxidation rate of TiAl it is essential to prevent the formation of non-protective TiO 2 scales. In this study the affinity of titanium to oxygen was lowered by forming <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides.</b> Si-based coatings with a thickness of 10 µm were deposited on the TiAl substrate by means of magnetron sputter technique. The coating system had to be pre-treated to form thermodynamically stable <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides.</b> A detailed study of phase formation in bare γ-TiAl under various exposure conditions, such as oxygen and nitrogen partial pressure, temperature and time, led to an optimized pre-treatment process of 100 h at 1000 °C at 10 - 6 mbar. Thus no oxides and nitrides were formed during this procedure but phase alterations occurred caused by interdiffusion processes. Therefore this pre-treatment was successfully used to form <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides</b> in the coatings. Annealing at 1000 °C under high-vacuum conditions resulted in the formation of a Ti 5 Si 3 layer, whereas less thermodynamically stable <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides</b> (Ti 5 Si 4, TiSi and TiSi 2) formed when exposed to air at 750 °C for 100 h. With the latter pre-treatment, a mixed oxide scale was also found {{on the top of the}} coating. The oxidation behaviour of the pre-treated coatings on γ-TiAl was studied by cyclic testing at 900 °C and 950 °C in air. Phase formation and microstructure evolution of the samples were investigated after 10, 100 and 1000 cycles by SEM and EDX as well as XRD. Notably, the oxidation rate of the high-vacuum annealed samples is lower than that of the pre-oxidized ones. All specimens exceeded a lifetime of 1000 cycles at both test-temperatures at minimum. ...|$|R

A scope of the research encompassed a microstructural analysis with the use of macro and micro investigation - LM, SEM microscopy, XRD phase analysis and EDS analysis. Findings: The investigation has shown that the thickness of the TiAlSi coatings in initial conditions and after a test was in a range from 30 to 40 μm. The structure of the silicon-modified aluminide coatings is as following: the outer zone consisting of the TiAl 3 phase and <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides</b> / the middle zone consisting of columnar <b>titanium</b> <b>silicides</b> in phase TiAl 3 matrix / the inner zone consisting of TiAl 2 phase.

The presence of Si due to Ti-Si phase generation with high oxidation resistance is presented.
