5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski's personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper water vessel, his Gasser revolver, made in Austria–Hungary in 1869, and <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski's sabre {{can be seen in}} the Lovech regional museum.|$|E
5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E
50|$|For safety, it {{is common}} to mouse a {{threaded}} <b>shackle</b> to keep <b>the</b> pin from coming loose.

For pins that have a cross-hole in the threaded end a cotter pin can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> is exposed to air and water.

5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
25|$|In their brief, the Bar of Human Rights Committee and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers {{argued that}} the {{shackling}} of Deck was a human rights violation. It was also argued that <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> violated due process and common law and that <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> diminished courtroom dignity. Additionally, it was argued that <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|E
25|$|Deck and his {{attorneys}} also argued about {{the burden of}} proof.

Ultimately, the defense felt that the shackling of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning shackling made a difference in the decision that the jury made. The defense argued that this alone was a violation against the constitution and due process.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if blue lighting could reduce broiler stress and comply with legal labor comfort requirements in a new shackling area of a middle-size processing plant. In this study, <b>the</b> old <b>shackling</b> area was compared with the new area, where a blue lighting system was designed and implemented according to the regulations. The old and new areas were video- and audio-recorded during <b>the</b> <b>shackling</b> of 33, 850 broilers in each area. Data were statistically analyzed using the non-parametric test of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (w test). The results indicated 56 % reduction in wing-flapping and 3. 2 % noise reduction in the new area. These results were obtained by increasing 119 % lighting at the work stations in <b>the</b> <b>shackling</b> area, allowing workers to handle the birds more carefully, which may improve processing plant productivity.

50|$|Mousing (pronounced mouzing) is the {{application}} of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure a threaded clevis pin to a shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the clevis pin and around the body of <b>the</b> <b>shackle's</b> hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> in a closed position. Nylon zip ties are also commonly used in applications where <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> must be secured, but easy removal is required.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an upper bound plastic limit analysis for predicting drag anchor trajectory and load capacity. The shank and fluke of the anchor are idealized as simple plates. The failure mechanism involves {{the motion of}} the anchor about a center of rotation, the coordinates of which are systematically optimized to determine the minimum load at <b>the</b> <b>shackle.</b> For a given anchor orientation, the direction of <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> force is varied to establish a relationship between the magnitude and direction of <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> load. Coupling this relationship to the Neubecker-Randolph anchor line solution produces a unique solution for the magnitude and orientation of <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> force. <b>The</b> anchor is then advanced a small increment about the optimum center of rotation and the process is repeated. The upper bound method (UBM) provides a practical means to determine the trajectory of the anchor and the anchor load capacity at any point in the trajectory. To better understand of the anchor behavior, extensive parameter studies were carried out varying the properties of the anchor, anchor line, and soil. The UBM show good agreement with six full-scale tests covering several different anchor types and centrifuge model tests...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 19th century, [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style locks, or [...] "Polhem locks", invented by the eponymous Swedish {{inventor}} Christopher Polhem, became a more secure alternative to the prevailing smokehouse and screw locks. These locks had a cast iron body that was loaded with a stack of rotating disks. Each disk had a central cutout to allow the key to pass through them and two notches cut out {{on the edge of the}} disc. When locked, the discs passed through cut-outs on <b>the</b> <b>shackle.</b> <b>The</b> key rotated each disk until the notches, placed along the edge of each tumbler in different places, lined up with <b>the</b> <b>shackle,</b> allowing <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> to slide out of the body.

25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} began in an {{explosive}} fashion. While the first over {{of the day}} (bowled by Agarkar to Adam Gilchrist) yielded only 3 runs, the second over {{was the one that}} set the tone for a day which was morbidly frustrating for the bowlers and was heavily in favour of the batsmen. The second over of the day(Ashish Nehra to Gilchrist), and the 92nd over of the Australian innings fetched 12 runs. The scoring sequence was as follows: 3–0–0–1–4–4. But in the 96th over, Agarkar managed to stop the Gilchrist juggernaut when he had him to offer a catch to Sehwag for 29, made from only 24 balls. Australia, were still looking strong at 426/5 with Ponting still around for an undefeated 182. Ponting was moving sedately at a rather sluggish pace ever since he had reached 150, and seemed considerably slow before he broke off <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> with two elegant and sweetly timed boundaries off Nehra in the 103rd over. Five balls later, Ponting brought up his double century of a mere 289 balls with another exquisite drive to the fence. When he reached his 200, he paused to blow a kiss to his wife. He had not only scored his second double century in what happened to be a prolific year for him, but also had stitched a valuable partnership with Andy Bichel, who had scored a gutsy 19 from 45 balls before Kumble had him dismissed. The Australians, though, gave the Indian bowlers and fielders no respite, as Jason Gillespie and Ponting came together to add a partnership of 83 runs, with Gillespie making merry with 48 from 53 balls, and Ponting had already raced to 242 from 350 balls by then. However, operating in his 43rd over, Kumble first got rid of Ponting and then picked up the remaining two Australian wickets off the last two balls of that over as well. This put a huge dent on the Australian hopes of making a 600-plus score.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of padlock locking mechanisms: {{integrated}} & modular. Integrated locking mechanisms directly engage <b>the</b> padlock's <b>shackle</b> with <b>the</b> tumblers. Examples of integrated locking mechanisms are rotating disks (found in [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style padlocks where a disk rotated by the key enters a notch cut into <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> to block it from moving) or lever tumblers (where {{a portion of the}} bolt that secures <b>the</b> <b>shackle</b> enters <b>the</b> tumblers when the correct key is turned in the lock). Padlocks with integrated locking mechanisms are characterized by a design that does not allow disassembly of the padlock. They are usually older than padlocks with modular mechanisms and often require the use of a key to lock.|$|R

25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from <b>the</b> <b>shackles</b> of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E
