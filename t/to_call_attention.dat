5|$|Albizu Campos {{had been}} {{corresponding}} with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose {{a group of}} nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to {{the leadership of the}} Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{disagree}} about who taught Pythagoras {{due to an}} absence of reliable information. Some say his training was almost entirely Greek, others exclusively Egyptian and Oriental.

Of the various claims regarding his Greek teachers, Pherecydes of Syros is mentioned most often.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Stavans {{published}} in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia a Spanglish translation of {{the first chapter of}} Cervantes’ Don Quixote de la Mancha. The translation has been controversial throughout the world, garnishing celebrations and attacks. Critics accuse Stavans of using Spanglish <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> to himself. Supporters say that the translation is an indication that the Latino community in the United States has come of age. Stavans has responded to the reactions with interviews in which he argues that Spanglish is today’s manifestation of “mestizaje,” the crossbreeding of racial, social, and cultural traits of Anglos and Latinos similar to what occurred during the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The {{outgoing}} centre-right {{government was}} perceived to have harassed university assistants, the most junior faculty rank, by publicly questioning their qualifications, {{by increasing the}} teaching load {{of those who had}} not completed doctoral theses, and by limiting prospects for promotion and tenure. In May 1982, after several unions and associations announced a strike of assistants <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> to their unmet grievances, the new education minister Alain Savary assured union leaders that all assistants who wished to continue a university career would be granted tenure. Promotion would be facilitated by the establishment of a thousand new maitre-assistant post per year for 4 years. In April 1982, following several demonstrations and strikes by the National Associations of Assistants (ANA), 2000 new tenured assistant positions were created.|$|E
25|$|When in 1920 the {{informal}} white-line printmakers' group organized its own exhibition, Weinrich showed a dozen works, including one called Cows Grazing in the Dunes near Provincetown. This print shows greater tendency to abstraction than eitherBroken Fence or the prints made by other Provincetown {{artists of the}} time. The cows and dunes are recognizable but not presented realistically. The white lines serve to emphasize the blocks of muted colors which are the print's main pictorial elements. Weinrich uses {{the texture of the}} wood surface <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> to the two-dimensional plane—the paper on which she made the print—in contrast with the implicit depth of foreground and background of cows, dunes, and sky. While the work is not Cubist, it has a proto-Cubist feel {{in a way that is}} similar to some of the more abstract paintings of Paul Cézanne.|$|E
