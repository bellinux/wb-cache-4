40|$|Nurses {{work with}} “vulnerable people” during their careers. People can {{experience}} vulnerability whenever their health or usual function is compromised and increases {{when they enter}} unfamiliar surroundings, situations or relationships. Vulnerability is therefore a key concept for professional practice, yet it is a complex and elusive phenomenon that is ill defined within the literature. The prevailing discourse relates to the identification of traditional vulnerable groups, due to increased risk of premature morbidity and mortality. There are, however difficulties associated with incorrectly labelling individuals as vulnerable or conversely not recognising vulnerability. A contrasting discourse identifies all human beings as vulnerable, {{as part of their}} humanity. This paper will present a theoretical exploration of the shifting sands of vulnerability utilising the humanising framework proposed by <b>Todres</b> et al (2009), in order to illuminate the complexities of the phenomenon of vulnerability.

40|$|Background Spiritual care {{is viewed}} as {{integral}} to holistic nursing practice but studies suggest that most nurses feel unprepared to deal with spiritual needs (Cooper et al 2013). Initial findings of this phenomenological study, where student nurses discuss their experiences of spiritual care, will be outlined in this presentation including exemplars {{that are relevant to}} critical care practice. Aim The presentation will discuss phenomenology as a methodological approach and initial findings around student nurses experiences that have transformed their understanding of spiritual care. Methodology Phenomenology (Van Manen 2014) was chosen for this study as it draws of the lived experience of participants to develop an understanding of the phenomena being explored. This approach fits with the research aim to understand aspects that transform students understanding of spiritual care. Students volunteered {{to participate in the study}} and were interviewed using a semi structured schedule to allow exploration of their experiences. Ethical approval was gained before starting data collection. Analysis The use of interpretative analysis will be discussed considering the benefits and limitations when used in phenomenological research (<b>Todres</b> & Holloway 2010). Exemplars from the study will be used to identify key issues around learning about spiritual care. Potential implications for critical care practice will be outlined. Results Phenomenological methods produced some rich descriptions exploring spiritual care. Currently, students are talking about practice based experiences as the main medium that changes their understanding of spiritual care. Students are influenced by good staff role models and individualised patient care. The trustworthiness of phenomenology as an approach will be discussed. Summary This presentation should enable delegates to consider the use of phenomenology as a research approach, particularly related to spiritual care practices. References Cooper, K.

40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is {{a rising}} international {{issue that has}} become a key concern for human rights organizations and governments throughout the world. As such, new policies are being developed and implemented to combat the problem. A guiding standard for these policies is the United Nations (UN) 2003 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which established a formal definition of human trafficking. While the UN Protocol was a significant step in the fight against human trafficking, it is limited by its framework, which focuses heavily on criminalization and punishment of traffickers. Recent discourse and research argues that it is essential to consider root macro structural and societal sources of exploitation in order to establish more effective policies (Barner et al., 2014; Gallagher, 2001; Haynes 2009; Obokata, 2006; Pourmokhtari, 2015; <b>Todres,</b> 2011). Grounded in conflict and otherness theories, and human rights and feminist perspectives (feminist rights-based approaches), the current study uses data from national and international agencies to assess socioeconomic characteristics of nations (i. e. prevalence of human trafficking, social and economic development, gender inequality, and stability) that are associated with efforts to combat human trafficking.

40|$|This study aims {{to produce}} phenomenological {{descriptive}} and interpretive {{knowledge about the}} early postnatal anal incontinence experience, from a physiotherapy disciplinary perspective. The philosophical underpinnings of the study draw on the texts of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Phenomenological interviews were conducted and audio-recorded with three participants, who all lived with the condition. An open, in-depth approach was adopted to allow rich and nuanced data to be obtained. The transcribed interviews were first analysed based on Giorgi’s (2009) descriptive phenomenological method. The essential structure of the postnatal anal incontinence experience consists of six key constituents: changed bodily self, evolving sense of self, sense of becoming familiar, sense of hope, emotional engagement, and an overriding sense of putting baby first. Finally, an embodied interpretation {{in the form of}} a poem was articulated following the framework presented by Galvin and <b>Todres</b> (2013) of a body-based hermeneutics, using emotive language to enhance feelings of empathy with the reader. All the six key-constituents forming the essential structure were at least implicitly present in the poem. It is hoped that the results will add to the evidence base, and contribute towards the development of meaningful services and improved physiotherapeutic care for these women.   Key-words: Early postnatal anal incontinence experience; existential phenomenology; meaningful physiotherapeutic car...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} be based upon the {{findings}} of an in-depth study of the lived experience of popular music festival-goers in the UK. The research was grounded in the philosophical roots of both experience and descriptive phenomenology. Phenomenological research is about “going back to people’s specific experiences and letting the concepts come from there” (<b>Todres</b> and Holloway 2010, p 183). The research used Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological method (2009). Giorgi’s method {{is based on the}} early twentieth century philosopher Husserl’s scientific approach to developing phenomenology. Giorgi (2009) offers a robust process for analysing situated experiences that gives a clear insight into a phenomenon. The constituents discovered that form the structure of the phenomenon of the popular music festival experience can be drawn as polar opposites. However the nature of the experience is more about the mixed valence of emotions rather than the bipolar explanation of concepts such as reversal theory. This resonates with the critical theories of leisure, especially that of freedom and constraint and the need to accept negative as well as positive emotions in a holistic view of the experience. Stebbins (2006) may have referred to leisure studies as the 'happy science', but this study not only identified the highs experienced by the participants but also their depths of despair...|$|E
40|$|In {{a climate}} of intense {{international}} scrutiny of healthcare and nursing in particular, there is an urgent need to identify, foster and support a caring disposition in student nurses worldwide. Yet relatively {{little is known about}} how core nursing values are shaped during education programmes and this warrants further investigation. This longitudinal study commencing in February 2013 examines the impact of an innovative nursing curriculum based on a humanising framework (<b>Todres</b> et al. 2009) and seeks to establish to what extent professional and core values are shaped over the duration of a three year nursing programme. This paper reports on Phase One which explores student nurses' personal values and beliefs around caring and nursing at the start of their programme. Undergraduate pre-registration nursing students from two discrete programmes (Advanced Diploma and BSc (Honours) Nursing with professional registration) were recruited to this study. Utilising individual semi-structured interviews, data collection commenced with February 2013 cohort (n = 12) and was repeated with February 2014 (n = 24) cohort. Findings from Phase One show that neophyte student nurses are enthusiastic about wanting to care and aspire to making a difference to patients and their families. This research promises to offer contributions to the debate around what caring means and in particular how it is understood by student nurses. Findings will benefit educators and students which will ultimately impact positively on those in receipt of healthcare...|$|E
40|$|Background ‘Participation’ {{in health}} {{is based upon}} the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Functioning ‘involvement in life situations’. However, in Social science literature, {{participation}} is based upon children’s rights (UNICEF, 1989). Clark et al (2014) defines participation as the ‘Act of doing and being involved’ where voice and agency play a role in influencing change. Carpenter and McConkey (2012) have suggested it is the healthcare professionals’ ‘moral imperative’ to listen to voices of disabled children. King (2013) suggests a way forward should explore these social aspects of participation including their everyday ‘lived experiences’ or ‘Lifeworld’ which have limited studies in childhood disability (<b>Todres,</b> 2008). Objective: This study explores the ‘Lifeworld’ and views of children and youth with Cerebral Palsy (CP), about what participation in recreational activities means to them. Methodology: Qualitative: 2 Interviews before and after a diary of recreational activities completed over 12 weeks. Participatory ‘Mosaic’ methods were developed using puppetry and ‘sandboxing’. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was carried out on 2 case studies where descriptive, interpretative and linguistic components were analysed. Results: Emergent themes include enriched perspectives of the emotional impact of living with CP and metaphors to enhance our understanding of their Lifeworld experiences. It is a complex hybridity of factors that influences their experiences. Conclusions / Implications for practice: More data is needed to fully appreciate the Lifeworld of a child or young person with CP, participating in recreational activities, before consideration can be given as to how we might change physiotherapy practice...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{an aspect}} of embodied relationship that is recognised in colloquial figures of speech but is not theorised, nor even much acknowledged in the psychotherapeutic literature. It argues that when we experience subtle sensations of extending towards another person, as we might when our "heart goes out" to them, and of pulling away, as we might when we "draw back", this seemingly internal experience is snesed by the other. Using a phenomenological-hermeneutic methodology underpinning by Merleau-Ponty, van Manen and <b>Todres,</b> exercised were used to bring such experiences to the awareness of several cohorts of experienced and inexperienced therapists attending a training course. Verbal and written accounts of what was felt during the exercised, and of similar experiences from more naturalistic settings, were collected along with the researchers' own accounts. These accounts are discussed {{within the framework of}} a Gadamerian Conversation with a view to making explicit the implication for Person-centred therapy with regard to practice, supervision and training. The conversation speaks of the the impact of these experiences upon whether or not clients perceive therapists as authentic, unconditionally accepting and empathic. Assumptions are uncovered and challenged and an alternative narrative emerges from a consideration of multiple contexts. The conversation also speaks of an unseen dance of closeness and distance that arises as each moves towards and away from the other. Conversation (and silence) is inevitably accompanied and impacted by this dance, which happens in the background of every interaction. The unseen dance impacts not only the relationship, but also each person's organismic state...|$|E
40|$|How can {{children}} grow {{to realize their}} inherent rights and respect the rights of others? In this book, authors Jonathan <b>Todres</b> and Sarah Higinbotham explore this question through both human rights law and children 2 ̆ 7 s literature. Both international and domestic law affirm that children have rights, but how are these norms disseminated so that they {{make a difference in}} children 2 ̆ 7 s lives? Human rights education research demonstrates that when children learn about human rights, they exhibit greater self-esteem and respect the rights of others. The Convention on the Rights of the Child [...] the most widely-ratified human rights treaty [...] not only ensures that children have rights, it also requires that states make those rights 2 ̆ 2 widely known, by appropriate and active means, to adults and children alike. 2 ̆ 2 This first-of-its-kind requirement for a human rights treaty indicates that if rights are to be meaningful to the lives of children, then government and civil society must engage with those rights in ways that are relevant to children. Human Rights in Children 2 ̆ 7 s Literature investigates children 2 ̆ 7 s rights under international law [...] identity and family rights, the right to be heard, the right to be free from discrimination, and other civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights [...] and considers the way in which those rights are embedded in children 2 ̆ 7 s literature from Peter Rabbit to Horton Hears a Who! to Harry Potter.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} composite first person narrative interpretive methods, as described by <b>Todres,</b> {{across a range of}} phenomena. This methodology introduces texture into the presently understood structures of phenomena and thereby creates new understandings of the phenomenon, bringing about a form of understanding that is relationally alive that contributes to improved caring practices. The method is influenced by the work of Gendlin, Heidegger, van Manen, Gadamer, and Merleau-Ponty. The method&#x 0027;s applicability to different research topics is demonstrated through the composite narratives of nursing students learning nursing practice in an accelerated and condensed program, obese female adolescents attempting weight control, chronically ill male parolees, and midlife women experiencing distress during menopause. Within current research, these four phenomena have been predominantly described and understood through quantified articulations that give the reader a structural understanding of the phenomena, but the more embodied or &#x 201 C;contextual&#x 201 D; human qualities of the phenomena are often not visible. The &#x 201 C;what is it like&#x 201 D; or the &#x 201 C;unsaid&#x 201 D; aspects of such human phenomena are not clear to the reader when proxies are used to &#x 201 C;account for&#x 201 D; a variety of situated conditions. This novel method is employed to re-present narrative data and findings from research through first person accounts that blend the voices of the participants with those of the researcher, emphasizing the connectedness, the &#x 201 C;we&#x 201 D; among all participants, researchers, and listeners. These re-presentations allow readers to develop more embodied understandings of both the texture and structure of each of the phenomena and illustrate the use of the composite account as a way for researchers to better understand and convey the wholeness of the experience of any phenomenon under inquiry...|$|E
40|$|Person-centred is now {{a widely}} used term to {{describe}} much dementia care in the UK and Jersey. This existential hermeneutic phenomenological research seeks to discover the lived experience of person-centred dementia care for nurses in Jersey and through this, the essences and meanings of person-centred care. It is grounded in Merleau-Ponty’s ideas of embodiment for {{being in the world}} and Buber’s primacy of relationships and includes complimentary ideas within Lévinas, Gendlin and Vanier’s philosophies. Its methodology is inspired predominantly by van Manen, it is hermeneutic in its interpretive and poetic stance and is existential in its focus on nurse’s lived experiences. Eight nurses, working in care homes and specialist dementia care units, took part in semi-structured interviews which were recorded and transcribed. Deep immersion into these texts followed using the six existentials of corporeality, relationality, temporality, spatiality, materiality and mood, proposed by van Manen and <b>Todres,</b> as lenses to get closer to the participants’ lived experiences, essences and meaning of person-centred dementia care. This research has been amongst the first to use six existentials for data analysis; it demonstrates the accessibility of this methodology for counsellors from its parallels with therapy; it demonstrates the potential of poetry and metaphor images to uncover the essences and meanings of phenomena; and its enhanced focus on the experience of person-centred care reveals considerable rhetoric {{in the use of the}} term in mission statements and care philosophies. This research shows that the term, and the models and frameworks associated with it, are not well understood, indicating the need to embrace a new understanding of person-centred care from the macro context to individual practitioners; the need for more effective training, education and practice development together with new support structures for nurses and better communication throughout the services. It also proposes a new vision focussed more on ‘caring’ than ‘care’ and for a uniting Jersey Dementia Strategy to help refine and define systems, policy, practice and care...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an in-depth {{understanding of the}} lived experience of people that attended a popular music festival in the UK. The research {{is grounded in the}} philosophical roots of both experience and descriptive phenomenology. Phenomenological research is about “going back to people’s specific experiences and letting the concepts come from there” (<b>Todres</b> and Holloway 2010, p 183). The research used Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological method (1985, 2009). Giorgi’s method is based on the early twentieth century philosopher Husserl’s scientific approach to developing phenomenology. Giorgi (2009) offers a robust process for analysing situated experiences that gives a clear insight into a phenomenon. Ten interviews with festival-goers who went to the Isle of Wight Festival in June 2011 were conducted. Using Giorgi’s method, the participants’ words were transformed into meaning units, which then underwent a process of descriptive analysis. This involved scientific phenomenological reduction using free imaginative variation. The constituent parts of the experience were identified and used to set out, what Husserl (1982 [1925]) defines as the morphological essence of the experience. This was achieved by formulating an invariant structure that eidetically captured the phenomenon of the popular music festival experience. The constituents discovered to form the structure of the phenomenon, that is the lived popular music festival experience, can be drawn as polar opposites. However the nature of the experience is more about the mixed valence of emotions rather than the bipolar explanation of concepts such as reversal theory. This resonates with the critical theories of leisure, especially that of freedom and constraint and the need to accept negative as well as positive emotions in a holistic view of the experience. Stebbins (2006, 2011) may refer to leisure studies as the 'happy science', but the research not only identified the highs experienced by the participants but also their depths of despair. The social aspect was found to be important, as festival-goers experienced both a sense of communitas and of personal angst and enmity in relation to others. Finally, whilst hedonistic behaviour led to a sense of heightened excitement and euphoria, it also engendered shock and concern over the extent of some deviant behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Background, {{including}} underpinning literature and, wherever possible, {{the international}} {{relevance of the}} research The rise in elderly populations with complex long-term conditions is a global phenomenon (World Health Organisation, 2011). However evidence has emerged internationally around concerns about quality of care, particularly for older people (Katz 2011; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2013). It {{has been argued that}} in target-driven care environments, there is the potential for care professionals to lose sight of the person receiving the care and focuses on task-completion, resulting in dehumanising care cultures (Galvin and <b>Todres</b> 2013). Educating nurse students to effectively as well as compassionately deliver complex care to vulnerable people represents considerable challenges. Following a number of high profile examples of poor quality care in the United Kingdom (UK) (Francis 2013), health profession education providers now follow professional body guidelines that mandate that values for compassionate practice clearly underpin curricula. Limited evidence exists however, concerning the impact of this initiative over time. This paper reports on a study that evidences the impact on students of an education programme based on a humanising care philosophy in shaping the students’ value base as they progress through their education programmes. Aim(s) and/or research question(s) /research hypothesis(es). This paper reports on a five-phase longitudinal study exploring the impact of an undergraduate-nursing curriculum based on a humanising care philosophy on the values of individual students. Research methodology/research design, any ethical issues, and methods of data collection and analysis The study uses a qualitative longitudinal approach to understanding the beliefs and values of student nurses from the day of entry, through their education programme to completion. Focusing on two cohorts of students one year apart, data were collected by individual interview at commencement and completion and by focus groups {{at the end of their}} first placement and at the end of their first and second years. This presentation reports up to the end of the programme for the first cohort and end of second year for the second cohort. Ethics approval was gained for the entire project. At each stage of the process, students were formally invited to participate and on-going individual consent was gained. The audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Key findings and recommendations By the end of their first placement, both groups were very similar in the expression of their values and to some extent presented a rather negative view of their experiences. However students from both groups became more articulate in expressing their values particularly in relation to their placement experience, as they moved through their programme. Four on-going and developing themes emerged from the data: personal journey, impact of the curriculum, impact of practice and values development. Overall, although each cohort followed two distinct curricula, there were few differences between the groups at each stage. Reasons for this will be discussed. Both groups felt they had become less judgmental, that the curriculum had empowered them to challenge practice and enhanced their confidence. Students also reported that their mentors (placement supervisors) role modelled authentic compassionate care in practice. Over time students’ insight into the complexity of caring developed and their understanding of the importance of practice that respected patient individuality deepened. This study has evidenced the strong link between curriculum and its impact on the evolving values of nursing students. Whilst this paper reports on a local study from one university in the UK, transferability of findings to other settings can be judged; it is argued that the insights will have resonance for nurse educators more widely as well as other health professional disciplines.

40|$|Purpose: People can {{experience}} feeling vulnerable whenever their health or usual function is compromised and can increase {{when they enter}} unfamiliar surroundings, situations or relationships. One’s experience of vulnerability can also be heightened through interaction {{between the individual and}} the society within which they live. As such, vulnerability is a dynamic concept that crosses the interface between the self and the social world. It is therefore a key concept for professional nursing practice; however this complex, elusive phenomenon is ill defined within the literature. Within studies of vulnerability it is the existential (lived) experience (emic perspective) that is the most silent in comparison to normative perspectives (etic perspective). The Gypsy/Travelling community are often normatively identified by researchers and professionals as a vulnerable group due to increased morbidity and mortality (Goward et al. 2006; Parry et al. 2007) as well as their marginalised status within society (Van Cleemput 2007; McCaffery 2009). But this tells little of the experience of feeling vulnerable by the individuals themselves, and yet without their stories and experiences how can professionals ensure that service developments meet their needs. This paper shall present a PhD research study conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) which sought to address this gap in the evidence base by exploring the lived experience of vulnerability of a Gypsy/Travelling community. Methods: The study consisted of two phases (a breadth phase followed by a depth phase) inspired by the work of <b>Todres</b> and Galvin (2005). The breadth phase included narrative interviews, and the depth phase utilised descriptive phenomenology (Giorgi 2009). Results: The breadth phase identified facets of vulnerability related to about the individual’s experiences of feeling vulnerable related to travelling, health and fear of the future, being an outsider and being part of a cultural group whose identity was under threat. This last facet of vulnerability linked to their experience of being part of a cultural group with threatened cultural identity and heritage was incredibly evocative. As such, it was the phenomenon that was explored further in the second phase (depth phase). Conclusion: The findings of this study on the lived experience of vulnerability (emic) presents a different perspective on vulnerability than what is already known from the literature (etic). This new knowledge develops our understanding of the concept of vulnerability itself, which in turn can enhance nurses’ professional skills and knowledge when working with people who may be experiencing feeling vulnerable. In addition, this oral presentation will illuminate a light on experiences of vulnerability of Gypsies and Travellers, a largely hidden group within society and presents their voice to be heard alongside the academic discourse. The paper shall conclude by presenting a new, novel theory to understand vulnerability, referred to as “Etemic”; a fusion between the emic and etic. It shall argue that it is only through an appreciation of the Etemic that services can be developed to effectively address the needs of individuals within the Gypsy/Travelling community...|$|E

The Gypsy/Travelling community are often normatively identified by researchers and professionals as a vulnerable group due to increased morbidity and mortality (Goward et al. 2006; Parry et al. 2007) as well as their marginalised status within society (Van Cleemput 2007; McCaffery 2009). But this tells little of the experience of feeling vulnerable by the individuals themselves, and yet without their stories and experiences how can professionals ensure that service developments meet their needs. This research addresses this gap in the evidence base by exploring the lived experience of vulnerability of a Gypsy/Travelling community. The study consisted of two phases (a breadth phase followed by a depth phase), after the work of <b>Todres</b> and Galvin (2005). The breadth phase (Phase 1) consisted of narrative interviews with five Gypsies and Travellers exploring times in their lives when they had felt vulnerable. This identified the following:  A feeling of vulnerability created by the potential or actual lack of physical travelling experience.  Fear of the future and declining physical health.  Being an outsider; this experience of vulnerability contained two similar but distinct variants. o Insider identity o Perception of others outside the Gypsy /Travelling community  Vulnerability connected to the ambiguities of their historical, cultural and geographical identity. Phase 2 explored the experience of vulnerability related to the ambiguities of their historical, cultural and geographical identity by exploring their experience of being part of a cultural group with threatened cultural identity and heritage. The lived experience of this type of vulnerability was described by 15 participants and descriptive phenomenological analysis (Giorgi 2009) identified six constituents of the phenomenon of vulnerability:  Vulnerability due to feeling defined and homogenised in a particular way  Vulnerability of feeling pressurised to conform to live a particular way  Vulnerability of feeling split in one’s identity  Vulnerability due to feeling a loss of one’s heritage  Vulnerability of feeling discriminated, persecuted and threatened  Vulnerability of powerlessness The findings of this study on the lived experience of vulnerability (emic) present a different perspective to vulnerability than what is already known from the literature (etic). This develops the understanding of the concept of vulnerability itself, which can enhance professional skill and knowledge when working with people who may be experiencing feeling vulnerable. In addition, this thesis illuminates a light on experiences of vulnerability of Gypsies and Travellers, largely hidden within society. This new knowledge of their stories can be used to influence policy as well as statutory services (health, education and social care). Lastly, the thesis proposes a new, novel theory to understand vulnerability, referred to as “Etemic”; a fusion between the emic and etic. It argues that it is only through an appreciation of the Etemic that services can be developed to effectively address the needs of individuals within the Gypsy/Travelling community...|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} research conference was excellent. The conference was {{opened with a}} keynote address by Dr. Jan Morse (a professor who is coming to AU convocation this year tor receive an honorary doctorate from Athabasca University for her contributions to health research. I attended several parallel sessions regarding {{qualitative research}}, primarily dealing with methodological issues (which is a particular interest for me at te current moment as I try to learn new methodological issues and challenges in qualitative research). These sessions are particularly of benefit to me because I currently teach three research courses in our Master of Nursing/Master of Health Studies Program. I have designed the Advanced Qualitative Research Course as well, so I am also interested in trying to discover what is new and cutting edge in this field. There was opportunities to meet and dialogue with colleagues {{from around the world}} (Australia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Africa and the US). Approximately 30 people attended the session that I presented and {{there were a number of}} questions that were generated from the session that lead to fruitful discussion. It is quite exciting for me to see the applications of qualitative research that people are using in different areas of the world. I received a couple of emails following my presentation acknowledging people’s appreciation for the session. Another keynote presenter talked about qualitative research and dementia care and the closing keynote speaker Dr. Les <b>Todres</b> presented a very interested and philosophical paper about the importance of being with in research. This found particularly interesting as it was one of the themes that surfaced in my recent project in hope and long term care. It gave me a deeper understanding of how to use a theoretical framework for research. Research offers compelling evidence of the pivotal role that hope plays in health and personal well-being outcomes for individuals who are acutely, chronically or terminally ill. Many individuals who are living in long term care, experience chronic physical and mental health challenges that affect the quality of their lives. For many of these individuals, these health issues challenge their hope in the face of uncertain futures. There is evidence to show it is possible to foster hope in individuals who feel hopeless or whose hope has been challenged, and that having a sense of hope greatly increases their sense of meaning and purpose in life. The purpose of this study is to intentionalize health care staffs’ use of explicit hope facilitating strategies with residents who are living in long term care facilities. Aims: • develop heightened awareness of health care staffs’ use of purposive hope facilitation strategies in long term care • strengthen staff resolve to purposively engage in hope promotion strategies with their residents • normalize explicit hope facilitation as a vital component of care Method: An educational workshop was used to teach staff specific hope-focused strategies for working with residents in long term care. Participating staff were interviewed prior to the workshop to ascertain their knowledge and understanding about hope. Following the workshop, the researcher spent some time in the clinical area to observe the health care staff practice and identify through observation and conversation with each staff member, specific incidents of intentional use of hope strategies in their practice. Selected residents were also interviewed regarding their feelings/experiences related to use of hope. Results: Researcher is finishing data collection phase and will report the results at the conference. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|E
40|$|Study aim: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to describe how women and health care professionals perceive sexual health and services that are currently provided in Saudi Arabia. Background: At present, the worldwide health authority, {{in the form of the}} World Health Organisation (WHO) has drawn great attention to the importance of improving women‘s sexual health globally. It is increasingly concerned about women‘s sexual health and permanently works to shed light on the innovative approaches that are needed to raise women‘s awareness of risky behaviour, and to help them access the advice and treatment they need to avoid negative health outcomes that would impact on their future lives. Research into women‘s sexual health in Saudi Arabia will help in identifying possible causes of poor sexual health care that could be used as preventive tools in that, or similar cultures. In addition, it helps to meet women‘s physiological, emotional and educational needs, which is essential to support good sexual health. Methods and data: The researcher adopted an exploratory, qualitative method to conduct the study with an ethnographic design. It was undertaken in two governmental hospitals in Jeddah city, namely King Abdulaziz University Hospital and Maternity and Children Hospital. The duration of data collection was two months in each hospital. Women, doctors, nurses, and clinic managers all were participated in the study. Observational notes, document analysis and in-depth interviews were used for data collection. Detailed field notes were recorded of observations in the setting, clinical consultations and the participant‘s behaviours and interactions. 40 Interviews were conducted (21 with female patients and 19 with Health care professionals) and 74 consultations were observed. The data analysis was conducted using the framework identified by Holloway and <b>Todres</b> (2006, p. 219), for use in ethnographic research. Findings: Female participants reported experiencing more difficulties in talking about sexual matters generally, and specifically those that related to sexual intercourse. They also delayed seeking sexual health care as a result of the influence of Saudi social norms around women‘s sexuality. Plus, appointment issues, long waiting times, low quality of care provided and being dependent upon husbands for transportation were also barriers to accessing sexual health care or advice. Health care professionals tended to avoid initiating discussions about sexual matters in their clinical practices, to respect the cultural norms and avoid offending the patient. Many other barriers to talking about sexual topics in the clinic were also reported by the health care professionals in the current study. Sexual health care and services in Saudi Arabia are limited, lack integration to sexual health education and centre on reproductive health through the provision of obstetrics and gynecology care and contraception. Discussion: Using the Theory of Reasoned action as a theoretical framework to discuss the findings of the study this chapter sets out how the social norm pressures that are embedded in Saudi culture particularly those related to women and sex significantly influence both health care professionals and women‘s attitudes and behaviour towards sexual health care. The effect of Islamic guidance on Saudi culture and in participants‘ lives was very strong and clear. Adopting the concept of holistic sexual health explicitly in Saudi Arabia would be difficult and problematic. Missing the opportunity to talk about sexual issues in general, and in consultations in particular, put women at the possible risk of poor sexual health. Conclusion: Multifaceted interventions and programs are necessary to improve the quality of services that provide women sexual health care in Saudi Arabia. Efforts to influence social norms, empower women, enhance health care professionals‘ roles and functions and more research into women‘s sexual health is required...|$|E
