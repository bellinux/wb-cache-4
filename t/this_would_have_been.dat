5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E

5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This {{made it difficult for}} land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of crude}} natural gas through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt {{to take control of}} the facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the highest ever fourth innings score {{to result in}} a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived close calls before Hassett fell at 1/57.|$|E

5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
5|$|After {{five minutes}} on the final morning, Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin. The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.|$|E
5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E
5|$|Hibs enjoyed {{great success}} in the period {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. The club's participation in the (inaugural) 1955–56 European Cup meant that Easter Road became the first British ground to host European Cup football. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950. This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh. As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered exceptional for the era.|$|E

5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
5|$|Possibly, it was {{accelerated}} by {{the creation of}} the Deccan Traps, however, some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, or sea level change, separately or together. A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth (rather than usual seafloor rock), and evidence of colossal seawater movement directly afterwards (from layered sand deposits). Crucially the cores also showed a near complete absence of gypsum, the usual sea floor rock in the region, which is sulfate-containing; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, providing evidence of a probable link between the impact and a global scale of longer-term effects on the climate and food chain.|$|E
5|$|South Indian mercenaries {{were often}} {{employed}} in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages. Manavamma and Moggallana I (491–508) obtained {{the assistance of the}} Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne. However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king. Gajabahu I also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, and brought back 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives. Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the first line of defence for the island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India.|$|E
