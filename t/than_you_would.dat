Rakie Ayola explained: [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} be difficult at the beginning because he wasn't speaking to me. But he was initially just a little shy and sussing things out. He's a lot quieter <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect but then suddenly he'll say something that has everybody doubled up in laughter. You won't find anyone who doesn't like him."

500|$|Larkin {{chose the}} {{instrumentation}} for each track {{based on the}} various digital environments in the game. When the player is in the game's representation of New Mexico, for example, Larkin used a resonator guitar and flutes, creating what he called something [...] "indigenous to a southwest type of feel that's very contemporary". In other areas Larkin described the game's music as being [...] "less typical <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> find in most games" [...] because of the exotic landscape the developers had created. To create contemporary and exotic types of music in the game, Larkin employed a combination of real and synthesized instruments. Sometimes Larkin replaced synthesized performances with those of real musicians, as in the track [...] "Gallery Theme", where a synthesized vocal part was eventually discarded in favor of soprano Tasha Koontz. To create an exotic feel, Larkin used a group of Maasai tribesmen's chanting, who were recorded during their visit to Spokane, Washington, where Cyan Worlds was located at that time.|$|E
500|$|Dixon, a {{songwriter}} and singer, often writes or co-writes her own records. Discussing {{the writing process}} of The Alesha Show she said, [...] "I've written the majority of it and I co-write as well {{with a lot of}} people". Critics have suggested some of her songs are autobiographical, such as [...] "To Love Again" [...] (2009), co-written with Gary Barlow and John Shanks. Vocally, reviewer Andy Gill of The Independent suggested that Dixon's vocal strengths lie with more up-tempo songs, saying [...] "the problem is that her bubbly personality (and voice) is simply not as well suited to ballads as to perky dancefloor anthems". However, The Guardians Caroline Sullivan complemented her live vocals whilst reviewing her tour, The Alesha Show. She said, of her concert tour, that [...] "it was her singing that made the impression: she's more powerful <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> imagine, and when pitted against her band at their most blaring, she more than held her own. While this was going on, she was being flung between two male hoofers, proving, if nothing else, that pop stars who claim they can't dance and sing simultaneously just aren't trying".|$|E

500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have so much more to work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have with a nice princess or a prince ... where you have to be ever so careful with the draftsmanship".|$|E
500|$|The borough has a {{place in}} several American idioms. The phrase [...] is meant to convey an {{extremely}} short time such as an instant, sometimes in hyperbolic form, as in [...] "perhaps faster <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> believe is possible," [...] referring to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan. The expression [...] "melting pot" [...] was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel Zangwill's play The Melting Pot, which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set by Zangwill in New York City in 1908. The iconic Flatiron Building {{is said to have}} been the source of the phrase [...] "23 skidoo" [...] or scram, from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building. The [...] "Big Apple" [...] dates back to the 1920s, when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans stablehands to refer to New York City's horse racetracks and named his racing column [...] "Around The Big Apple." [...] Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world's jazz capital, and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term.|$|E
500|$|Total Films review {{gave the}} film 4/5 with its verdict: [...] "The Terminator story recharges with a post-apocalyptic jolt of energy. Frantic {{and full of}} welcome ties to the past, it also ploughs new ground with purpose. Fingers crossed McG will follow Cameron's lead and serve up a worthy sequel." [...] Devin Faraci of Empire {{magazine}} also gave a positive rating of {{four out of five}} stars, saying: [...] "McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago." [...] However, on CHUD, the latter said, [...] "Bale's desire to star as John Connor was probably the most fatal blow to the film; it completely distorted the shape of the story as it existed." [...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action generics (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> get from an expanded universe novel." [...] In contrast, James Berardinelli considered the ending {{the best part of the}} film, feeling that the first two-thirds were [...] "rambling and disjointed" [...] and that the lack of a central villain was only fixed when the T-800 appeared.|$|E

500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when someone asks, 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, reviews became more positive, and Friends {{became one of}} the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series as having {{consistently}} sharp writing and chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of Newsday, who had dismissed the pilot as a [...] "so-so Seinfeld wannabe" [...] in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode, and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series [...] "hit its stride" [...] in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations [...] "could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be [...] "original and innovative." [...] Bill Carter of The New York Times called the eighth season a [...] "truly stunning comeback." [...] Carter found that by [...] "generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs", the series made its way [...] "back into the hearts of its fans." [...] However, Liane Bonin of Entertainment Weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a [...] "disappointing buzzkill", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that [...] "the writing [...] still sharp." [...] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was [...] "alarmingly awful, far worse <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ever imagine a show that was once so good could be." [...] Friends was featured on Times list of [...] "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time", saying, [...] "the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself Friends, and was really about family." ...|$|E

500|$|Tomb Raider was {{critically}} acclaimed. In a 'world exclusive' review, GamesMaster magazine {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 90%, {{as well as the}} [...] "GamesMaster Gold award" [...] (awarded to games that manage a score of 90% or above). The editor regarded the quality of the visuals, the length and depth of the gameplay, and the [...] "spectacular" [...] last third of the game as the highlights. The summary said [...] "sitting back exhausted we were left with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws. How on earth are they going to top this in the sequel? Because of one thing there can be no doubt. Lara is back." [...] IGN's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively, stating that they felt the game was [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "beautifully presented", included [...] "great characterization" [...] and [...] "more depth <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> expect". They gave the game an overall score of 9.1 out of 10, the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996's Tomb Raider, describing it as [...] "amazing" [...] and concluding that the game [...] "did justice" [...] to both the character and franchise. Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location's setting and environment, and expressed that [...] "not one area ever feels like a rehash of another". Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing, and that it is [...] "unrivaled by any other game in the genre". Furthermore, the reviewer considered Lara's character development as [...] "an integral part" [...] of the whole game's experience, and concluded that Tomb Raider [...] "is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming's original treasure seekers". Australian TV show Good Game praised the game: it was rated 10/10 by both hosts, becoming the eighth game in the show's seven-year run to do so. Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five, stating that [...] "Tomb Raiders tone is somewhat at odds with its action, but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career".|$|E
