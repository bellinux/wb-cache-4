5|$|Harry Woods, the {{publisher}} of the other major newspaper, The Daily Nugget, was an undersheriff to Behan. He and his newspaper tended to side with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners), and the rural interests of <b>the</b> <b>ranchers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The site {{features}} a visitor center, {{housed in the}} historically restored Manzanar High School Auditorium, which has a permanent exhibit that tells {{the stories of the}} incarcerees at Manzanar, the Owens Valley Paiute, <b>the</b> <b>ranchers,</b> the town of Manzanar, and water in the Owens Valley.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. <b>The</b> <b>ranchers</b> largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E
5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{also known}} as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a range {{conflict}} that took place in Johnson County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River Country, when <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> hired armed gunmen to invade the county and wipe out the smaller settlements and alleged rustlers. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.|$|E

25|$|The Central Oregon Ranchers Association is a {{confederation}} {{of independent}} ranchers and farmers located in Central Oregon. After the Change, <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> and farmers {{of the area}} took in refugees who now work in exchange for settlement land. CORA's warriors prefer to ride horseback and wield bows, sabres, and javelins. The capital is located at Bend.|$|E

He is told that Fidel has somehow been persuaded or even forced to join a gang. Stark shall bring Fidel back to his father. The American {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>rancher</b> is worried sick about his son's well-being. When he delivers Fidel he understands just on time that things are very different. <b>The</b> <b>rancher</b> intends to whitewash his honour by getting rid of Fidel because he's ashamed of having an illegitimate son.|$|R

25|$|In 1861, Samuel Bishop {{and other}} ranchers started to raise cattle on the {{luxuriant}} grasses that {{grew in the}} Owens Valley. <b>The</b> <b>ranchers</b> came into conflict with the Paiutes over land and water use, {{and most of the}} Paiutes were driven away from the valley by the U.S. Army in 1863 during the Owens Valley Indian War.|$|E
25|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> and Cowboys {{who lived}} in the Cochise County {{countryside}} were resentful of the growing power of the business owners and townspeople who increasingly influenced local politics and law in the county. A cowboy in that time and region was generally regarded as an outlaw. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers.|$|E
25|$|Corbett’s {{business}} {{at that time}} dealt in general merchandise, hardware and farming implements - supplying <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> and farmers and the new settlers who were beginning to arrive by the Oregon Trail. Oregon Territory then included the large area now occupied by the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and part of Montana and Wyoming. Corbett was the first general merchant in Portland and probably in Oregon Territory.|$|E

25|$|Late in {{the decade}} the City of Los Angeles sued all <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> of the Valley, {{claiming}} the rights {{not only to the}} surface water of the Los Angeles River and its tributaries, but to the groundwater as well. In 1899, the California Supreme Court sided with the city. Without a reliable water supply, it became impossible to sell farm sites in the Valley.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties {{along the}} border {{continued}} during World War I while the United States was at war in Europe. Mexican bandits often raided American ranches to secure supplies, cattle, and horses, {{and in doing so}} sometimes killed <b>the</b> <b>ranchers.</b> U.S. troops stationed {{along the border}} shot raiders as they pursued them into Mexico. The biggest clash came in August 1918, when more than 800 American troops fought some 600 Mexicans near Nogales, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the wood}} carving {{activities}} {{are related to the}} making of items for religious purposes. These include images and masks, which are used for processions and dances. The use of masks dates back to the pre Hispanic era and today are used for dances such as Moors and Christians, the Devils, the Little Blacks, Los Viejitos, <b>the</b> <b>Ranchers,</b> the Hermits the Maringuias (men in women’s dress) and Cúrpites (which means “eat together”). Utilitarian items include spoons, trays and shallow bowls, some of which are elaborately decorated.|$|E

25|$|Some mutilations {{are said}} to occur in very brief periods. A 2002 NIDS report relates a 1997 case from Utah. Two ranchers tagged a {{specific}} calf, then continued tagging other animals in the same pasture. <b>The</b> <b>ranchers</b> were, at the most, about 300 yards from the calf. Less than an hour later, the first calf was discovered completely eviscerated—most muscle and all internal organs were missing. There was no blood, entrails, or apparent disturbance at the scene. Independent analysts both uncovered marks on the calf's remains consistent with {{two different types of}} tools: a large, machete-type blade, and smaller, more delicate scissors.|$|E
25|$|Detained in Southern California while {{attempting}} to obtain passage to China, Wilson decided to remain there. He married Ramona Yorba, daughter of Bernardo Yorba, a wealthy and prominent landowner, and purchased part of Rancho Jurupa in what would become Riverside County. Wilson was made Justice of the Peace for the Inland Territory and was entrusted with the care of Native American affairs. He was also commissioned {{to deal with the}} hostile Ute tribe over their cattle rustling and other crimes against <b>the</b> <b>ranchers.</b> His marriage to his second wife, Margaret Hereford produced a daughter Ruth who would later be mother to General George S. Patton Jr. commander of U.S. and allied forces during World War II.|$|E
25|$|His {{collaboration}} with Owen Wister on The Evolution of the Cowpuncher, published by Harper's Monthly in September 1893, {{was the first}} statement of the mythical cowboy in American literature, spawning the entire genre of Western fiction, films, and theater that followed. Remington provided {{the concept of the}} project, its factual content, and its illustrations and Wister supplied the stories, sometimes altering Remington's ideas. (Remington's prototype cowboys were Mexican rancheros but Wister made the American cowboys descendants of Saxons—in truth, they were both partially right, as the first American cowboys were both <b>the</b> <b>ranchers</b> who tended the cattle and horses of the American Revolutionary army on Long Island and the Mexicans who ranched in the Arizona and California territories).|$|E
