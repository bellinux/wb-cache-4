25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> survive my years as a POW.|$|E

500|$|Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin {{word meaning}} [...] "nobody". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main {{character}} of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is [...] "an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing." [...] Leto described his role saying, [...] "Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one {{all at the same}} time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character {{for the duration of the}} filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to keep track of where we were." [...] Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} , Aguilera {{revealed}} the occasion, theme {{and meaning of}} [...] "Fighter". She talked about her [...] "very chaotic and abusive" [...] home, where she did not feel [...] "safe". In school, Aguilera was picked on and alienated because of her musical passion. However, it made her become [...] "smarter and stronger". To release herself, Aguilera started to write songs {{at the age of}} 15, both music and lyrics; and it was the way how she found her voice. The writing process of [...] "Fighter" [...] began during her promotion for her debut album in 1999, when she was [...] "a part of the big craze pop phenomenon". According to Aguilera, her debut album helped her a lot to develop the process. She wanted to make an [...] "emotionally rich and positive empowering" [...] song, especially for women, {{in order for them to}} speak for themselves be strong. About the idea of the track, she revealed, [...] "I was coming up with titles and ideas and deciding what I wanted to write about. I had to sit down and make sense of my feelings and experiences. I learned a lot from the first record <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to develop. I took the good and the bad and considered some of the choices I made and became better because of it.|$|E
500|$|... in {{comparison}} to the NAIT. The [...] had clearer sound overall than all the others, and opened out the music superbly by being the most free flowing. The [...] was easily the most refined, yet was more immediate too. It proved superb with the tonal qualities of instruments, and added a dash of sweetness to higher frequencies also. David Price, writing in Hi-fi News, said that with the earlier NAITs gave the impression of [...] "something overly reminiscent of British hi-fi's 'cottage industry' past", but remarked that the [...] made [...] "all other integrateds sound positively pedestrian". Ian White said the [...] "sounds like a [...] that finally finished going through puberty and emerged as a mature adult", and What Hi-fi? referred to the [...] as [...] "one of the finest amplifiers available this side of 1000 pounds"; In The Absolute Sound, Wayne Garcia noted that the [...] "staggeringly good sound and wonderful value" [...] of the [...] contributed significantly to raising Naim's profile in the US audio market. Matthew Masters remarked about the 5i amp and CD player that [...] "it didn't seem to matter how complex or demanding the music was, the Naims would sort out the elements then present them in a perfectly-timed and coherent musical picture <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> understand – and feel – precisely what the performers were on about". Commenting on the NAIT XS, Malcolm Stewart wrote that the NAITs were [...] "a musically communicative, minimalist design".|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> along the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E

2500|$|Troubled by new acts he {{felt were}} imitating Radiohead, Yorke {{believed}} his music had {{become part of}} a constant background noise he described as [...] "fridge buzz", and became hostile to the music media. He told The Guardian: [...] "I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that the thing <b>that</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that." [...] He suffered from writer's block, and could not finish writing songs on guitar.|$|E
