However, in the {{penultimate}} chapter of the same book, Friedman argued that while capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms, [...] "poverty is in part a relative matter, [...] even in [...] countries, there are clearly many people living under conditions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> label as poverty." [...] Friedman noted that while private charity could be one recourse for alleviating poverty (and cited late 19th century Britain and the United States as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and eleemosynary activity), Friedman also noted that: ...|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} less {{favorable}} reviews of [...] "You Have 0 Friends" [...] that criticize the use of its cultural Facebook jokes. TV Fanatic, who gave the episode 3/5, said there was [...] "too much Facebook" [...] in the episode and that [...] "it was a great parody, but just a decent episode that could have had more LOL moments".

Well, all this may happen again. And so, Anthony, do you think that I should be right to throw away thirty pounds a year and to make a quarrel with my aunt, who is rich and kind-hearted although very over-bearing, and the only friend we have? If my father died, Anthony, or even was taken ill, and he is not very strong, what would become of us? Unless Aunt Thompson chose to help we should all {{have to go to the}} workhouse, for girls who have not been specially trained can earn nothing, except perhaps as domestic servants, if they are strong enough. I don't want to go away and read to Aunt Maria and take the pug dog out walking, although it is true I should like to see Italy, but I must--can't you understand--I must. So please reproach me no more, for it is hard to bear--especially from you." ...|$|E
