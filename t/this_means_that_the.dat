5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock was inbred 3×4 to Pot-8-Os. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{stallion}} appears once in {{the third}} generation and {{once in the}} fourth generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 3×4 to Highflyer, 4×4×4 to Herod and 4×4 to Eclipse.|$|E

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one {{considers}} string theory or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> geometry of spacetime {{is described in}} terms of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space.|$|E

5|$|The first 26 (numbered) {{pages of}} the {{manuscript}} paper for the pre-Oceanides suite are missing; assuming the first page would have been reserved for the title, <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> missing first movement likely consisted of 25 pages.

5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> longer Robinson works, the more coconuts {{he will be}} able to gather.

5|$|While a phoneme can be {{represented}} {{by more than one}} grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual pronunciation of a word is always clear from its orthographic form.|$|E

5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct, and could be differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations. According to Hume, <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> birds described could not simply have been escaped South American macaws. Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

5|$|In {{all cases}} <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), {{but in some cases}} the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Parliament of Norway {{are elected}} based on party-list {{proportional}} representation in plural member constituencies. This means that representatives from different political parties are elected from 19 constituencies, which are {{identical to the}} 19 counties. The electorate does not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. <b>This</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties may nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad.|$|E
