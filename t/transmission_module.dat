50|$|The Specific <b>Transmission</b> <b>Module</b> (STM) is {{a special}} {{interface}} for the EVC for communicating with legacy Class B ATP systems like PZB, Memor and ATB. It consists of specific sensing elements to lineside installations and an interface for hardware and logic adapting interface to EVC. The EVC must get special software for translation of legacy signals to unified internal ETCS communication. The driver is using standard ETCS cab equipment also on non ETCS lines. The STM enables therefore the usage of the ETCS equipped driving vehicle on the non-equipped network and is today essential for interoperability.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden the {{development}} of ATC started in the 1960s (ATC-1), and was formally introduced in the early-1980s together with high-speed trains (ATC-2). As of 2008, 9,831 km out of the 11,904 km of track maintained by Trafikverket—the Swedish government’s agency for railway infrastructure—had ATC-2 installed. However, since ATC-2 is generally incompatible with ERTMS/ETCS (as {{in the case of}} the Bothnia Line which is the first railway line in Sweden to exclusively use ERTMS/ETCS), and with the aim of Trafikverket to eventually replace ATC-2 with ERTMS/ETCS over the next few decades, a Special <b>Transmission</b> <b>Module</b> (STM) has been developed to automatically switch between ATC-2 and ERTMS/ETCS.|$|E

[...] The CTCS-2 system uses the classical technology of track circuits to detect {{the presence of a}} train on a piece of track. In addition, CTCS-2 uses both fixed-data balises (track-mounted transponders) and controllable-data balises controlled by a Lineside Electronic Unit (LEU) to transmit essential information and signal instructions from the Train Control Center to trains. Information and signal instructions are transmitted by the balises as [...] "telegrams", which are picked up by a balise <b>transmission</b> <b>module</b> mounted under the head of the train, and sent to an on-board [...] "vital computer" [...] for decoding. Using the data it has received, the computer calculates a [...] "speed control curve" [...] showing the maximum speed the train can maintain while allowing sufficient braking distance before any danger. The information is displayed to the train driver on a monitor.http://www.emsd.gov.hk/emsd/e_download/about/symposium/2011/session/fullpaper/M4_Full%20Paper_CL%20Wang.pdf Should the driver disregard this information by overspeeding, or enter a danger zone, the Vital Computer can make an automatic brake application.|$|E

Wireless sensing systems consist of sensors, electronic interfaces and processors, energy harvesters, and wireless <b>transmission</b> <b>modules.</b> Real-time data collection from sensors, combined with data analytics, can improve safety and performance, and reduce operational and maintenance cost in harsh environments.

A fundamental {{problem in this}} area is how to map QoS criterion at different layers and optimize QoS across the layers.

There are several important building blocks in this architec-ture, among others, QoS interaction between video coding and <b>transmission</b> <b>modules,</b> QoS mapping mechanism, video quality adaptation, and source rate constraint derivation. We describe the design and algorithms for each building block, which either builds upon or extend the state-of-the-art algorithms that were developed without much considerations of other layers. Finally, we use simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed architecture for progressive fine granularity scalability video transmission over time-varying and nonstationary wireless channel.
