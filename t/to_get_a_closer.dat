5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E
25|$|In fact, Drake {{had been}} {{preparing}} for action since the previous visit by Ranger, taking on volunteers from the Carrickfergus area to boost the crew from 100 to about 160, many of them landsmen who were to be used only for close-quarters combat, {{although there was a}} shortage of ammunition. Absent from the ship's company at this crucial time were the gunner, master's mate, boatswain, and lieutenant. The aging captain, George Burdon, was later reported to have been in poor health himself. Drake got under way about 8am, but with wind and tide against it, made little progress. After an hour or so a boat was therefore sent <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at the intruder. Jones opted to try a slight variant of the plan which had failed to capture the customs vessel a few days earlier; hiding most of the crew and the big guns. This time it worked; the crew of the reconnaissance boat was captured, and this success raised the morale of the Americans. One of the prisoners revealed the large number of volunteers who had gone aboard Drake.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E

2500|$|When he was 18, Castillo {{played in}} a band called The Tabbs, who wore mustard {{coloured}} Nehru jackets on stage. On 18 June 1970, exactly three months before Jimi Hendrix died, he snuck into one of [...] Hendrix's concerts and hid under the stage <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look. [...] After leaving The Tabbs, he then played with The Mudd and began heavy drug use, including mescaline, peyote and heroin. The band's lead singer, Tommy G, died of kidney failure, which Castillo blamed on Tommy's addiction to heroin. This caused him {{to shy away from}} using the drug again.|$|E
2500|$|Finally {{settling}} in San Francisco, Muir immediately {{left for a}} week-long visit to Yosemite, a place he had only read about. Seeing {{it for the first}} time, Muir notes that [...] "He was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower." [...] He later returned to Yosemite and worked as a shepherd for a season. He climbed a number of mountains, including Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana, and hiked an old trail down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake.|$|E
2500|$|Clark had his men {{build an}} entrenchment [...] {{in front of}} the fort's gate. While men fired at the fort {{throughout}} the night, small squads crept up to within [...] of the walls <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> shot. The British fired their cannon, destroying a few houses in the city but doing little damage to the besiegers. Clark's men silenced the cannon by firing through the fort's portholes, killing and wounding some of the gunners. Meanwhile, Clark received local help: villagers gave him powder and ammunition they had hidden from the British, and Young Tobacco, a Piankeshaw chief, offered to have his 100 men assist in the attack. Clark declined the chief's offer, fearing that in the darkness his men might mistake the friendly Piankeshaws and Kickapoos for one of the enemy tribes that were in the area.|$|E

Small details which, when he had first caught sight of her, distance had hidden from his view, now presented themselves. Her eyes, he discovered, which he had supposed brown, were only brown in their general colour-scheme. They were shot with attractive little flecks of gold, matching perfectly the little streaks gold which the sun, coming out again {{on one of his}} flying visits and now shining benignantly once more on the world, revealed in her hair. Her chin was square and determined, but its resoluteness was contradicted by a dimple and by the pleasant good-humour of the mouth; and a further softening of the face was effected by the nose, which seemed to have started out with the intention of being dignified and aristocratic but had defeated its purpose by tilting very slightly at the tip. This was a girl who would take chances, but would take them with a smile and laugh when she lost.|$|E

60|$|Burley {{sat down}} upon {{the edge of the}} porch and, {{carefully}} unwrapping the package, he disclosed some pieces of hard-baked yellow mud. The smaller ones bore the imprint of a circle with a dot in the center, very clearly defined. The larger piece bore the imperfect but reasonably clear track of a curiously shaped horseshoe, somewhat triangular. The sheriff placed these pieces upon the ground. Then he laid hold of Moore's crutch, which was carried like a rifle in a sheath hanging from the saddle, and, drawing it forth, he carefully studied the round cap on the end. Next he inserted this end into both the little circles on the pieces of mud. They fitted perfectly. The cowboys bent over <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> view, and Billings was wagging his head. Old Belllounds had an earnest eye for them, also. Burley's next move was to lift the left front foot of Moore's horse and expose the bottom to view. Evidently the white mustang did not like these proceedings, but he behaved himself. The iron shoe on this hoof was somewhat triangular in shape. When Burley held the larger piece of mud, with its imprint, close to the hoof, {{it was not possible to}} believe that this iron shoe had not made the triangular-shaped track.|$|E
