Though cognitive load is inevitable in such activity which promotes tremor, muscle fatigue induced tremor is significant {{among the most important}} sources of tremor. Characteristic of fatigue induced hand tremor and its dominant directional properties are reported in this work. For a fixed laparoscopic <b>tool</b> <b>grip</b> with temporally synchronized predefined task protocols, characteristics of fatigue induced tremors have been studied. Dominant component of tremor was found to be in the sagittal plane in case of both static and dynamic tasks. In order to relate it with the muscle fatigue level, spectral properties of surface electromyography (SEMG) were also investigated simultaneously. A study of transient effect on tool positioning was also included, which conjointly advocates the other experimental results on fatigue induced hand tremor as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Generic representatives {{have been}} {{proposed}} for the effective combination of symmetry reduction and symbolic representation with BDDs in non-probabilistic model checking. This approach involves the translation of a symmetric source program into a reduced program, in which counters are used to generically represent states of the original model. Symmetric properties of the original program can also be trans-lated, and checked directly over the reduced program. We extend this approach to apply to probabilistic systems with Markov decision process or discrete time Markov chain semantics, represented as MTBDDs. We have implemented a prototype <b>tool,</b> <b>GRIP,</b> which converts a symmetric PRISM program and PCTL property into reduced form. Model checking results for the original program can then be inferred by applying PRISM, unchanged, to the smaller model underlying the reduced program. We present encouraging experimental results for two case studies. ...|$|E

40|$|Different {{factors may}} have coevolved with hand dexterity such as bipedalism, brain enlargement, language, and the {{production}} and use of stone technology. Prehistoric stone tools are thus {{probably one of the}} key elements to examine the origin and evolution of these essential functions during human evolution. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the variability of traces resulting from use found on stone tools or on the body of the user, to better infer past archaeological tools, and to assess what the tool-using human hand specificities are, it is essential to investigate and describe tool manipulation itself. Studies investigated this question but either focused on static finger postures during grasping, or involved complex kinematic model of the coordination of the fingers necessitating the pose of many markers on the hand excluding the application of the method on non-human species. Here, we propose a new method to describe and quantify the dynamic strategies of <b>tool</b> <b>grip</b> and manipulation without the need of markers. We tested this method on five human subjects who had to make bamboo points using flint flakes. Time-based sequence analysis allowed identifying and describing both consistency and variation among users and types of use depending on the observed variable (e. g., hand contact areas, repositioning). The method proved to be efficient and, to our knowledge, is the only available method to describe and quantify with such detailed level grip and manipulation as dynamic process in both human and non-human primates without high technical constraint...|$|E
40|$|Developing a {{rigorous}} understanding of multiple global threats to species persistence requires {{the use of}} integrated modeling methods that capture processes which influence species distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) coupled with population dynamics models can incorporate relationships between changing environments and demographics and are increasingly used to quantify relative extinction risks associated with climate and land-use changes. Despite their appeal, uncertainties associated with complex models can undermine their usefulness for advancing predictive ecology and informing conservation management decisions. We developed a computationally-efficient and freely available <b>tool</b> (<b>GRIP</b> 2. 0) that implements and automates a global sensitivity analysis of coupled SDM-population dynamics models for comparing the relative influence of demographic parameters and habitat attributes on predicted extinction risk. Advances over previous global sensitivity analyses include the ability to vary habitat suitability across gradients, as well as habitat amount and configuration of spatially-explicit suitability maps of real and simulated landscapes. Using GRIP 2. 0, we carried out a multi-model global sensitivity analysis of a coupled SDM-population dynamics model of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in Mount Rainier National Park as a case study and quantified the relative influence of input parameters and their interactions on model predictions. Our results differed from the one-at-time analyses used in the original study, and we found that the most influential parameters included the total amount of suitable habitat within the landscape, survival rates, and effects of a prevalent disease, white pine blister rust. Strong interactions between habitat amount and survival rates of older trees suggests the importance of habitat in mediating the negative influences of white pine blister rust. Our results underscore the importance of considering habitat attributes along with demographic parameters in sensitivity routines. GRIP 2. 0 is an important decision-support tool {{that can be used to}} prioritize research, identify habitat-based thresholds and management intervention points to improve probability of species persistence, and evaluate trade-offs of alternative management options...|$|E

40|$|A unique dual {{pendulum}} system {{was developed to}} measure single-impact com-pression responses of foamed polymers. The data, complemented with a math-ematical model of impact, led to measures of the material’s energy absorption, compression modulus, and damping. Results are presented for a class of open-celled foamed polymers specifically developed for shock mitigation. The exper-iments employed such materials of four different densities, with impact times ranging in the 1 to 5 ms range and mean impact stresses up to 160 kN/m 2. The results for these materials showed: (1) energy losses of up to 50 % of incident energy, with a peak energy absorption per unit volume of 18 kJ/m 3; (2) peak compression modulus of 880 kN/m 2 with strain rates approaching 200 s− 1; (3) a mean damping factor of 0. 258 {{with a standard deviation}} of 0. 029.

40|$|Danielle Christine Bentley, Scott Gordon Thomas Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Abstract: Handgrip (HG) {{exercise}} {{has been}} prescribed as a lifestyle intervention to successfully reduce resting blood pressure (BP) among heterogeneous groups of participants. Current HG protocols have limited accessibility due to complicated exercise prescriptions and sophisticated required equipment. Therefore, this research describes {{the design and}} evaluation of the maximal intermittent (MINT) HG exercise strategy, consisting of both a novel exercise protocol (32 × 5  seconds maximal grip squeezes separated by 5  seconds of rest between sets) and an original <b>grip</b> <b>tool.</b> This research was a multistep progressive design that included 51 postmenopausal women as participants in three separate research studies. Part 1 of this research focuses on the MINT exercise protocol. A literature-informed rationale {{for the design of}} the protocol is described. This includes exercise intensity, work-to-rest ratio, and total exercise duration with reference to the unique physiology (mechanoreflex and metaboreflex) of postmenopausal women. Subsequent experimental analyses of acute responses to the MINT protocol revealed that women produced 50 % of their maximum grip force with moderate cardiovascular responses (increases of systolic BP: 41. 6  mmHg, diastolic BP: 20. 1  mmHg, heart rate: 35. 1  bpm) that remained far below the thresholds of concern identified by the American College of Sports Medicine. Part 2 of this research describes the creation of a novel <b>grip</b> <b>tool,</b> beginning with a mixed-methods assessment of participant opinions regarding two distinct in-laboratory <b>grip</b> <b>tools,</b> leading to the creation of four prototype MINT tools. Structured focus groups revealed a strong preference for MINT prototype  1 for all tool design features, including color, shape, size, and foam grip. Collectively, the result of this multistep research is a novel HG exercise strategy with enhanced accessibility by being easy to understand and simple to execute. The long-term training effectiveness of MINT as an exercise intervention for the reduction of resting BP has yet to be determined.
