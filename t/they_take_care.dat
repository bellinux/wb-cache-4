5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. Cord and Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the guards, and hear messages about problems with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only}} one minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return to the deck and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E
25|$|The next tier is the {{district}} council — South Hams District Council. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of {{matters such as}} local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism.|$|E
25|$|Judith Parker (Mimi Kuzyk) is Sophie's {{manipulative}} {{control freak}} mother. She {{is determined to}} reunite Sophie and Rick, faking a suicide attempt {{so that she can}} insist that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of her together and deliberately interfering when Sophie dates anyone who isn't Rick.|$|E

25|$|Hughes {{insisted on}} using tissues {{to pick up}} objects to {{insulate}} himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains, or other imperfections on people's clothes and demand that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of them. Once {{one of the most}} visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view, although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{have taken}} Billy to a French farm {{being used as}} a {{makeshift}} hospital. He is killed brandishing his knife.

25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> {{of some of the}} issues that were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E

500|$|According to New Zealand {{music critic}} Graham Reid, a {{contemporary}} Australian review remarked on the album's religiosity: [...] "oftentimes {{the music is}} a more truthful guide {{to the sense of}} the lyrics than the words themselves. Harrison is not a great wordsmith but he is a superb musician. Everything flows, everything interweaves. His melodies are so superb <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything …" [...] Like Holden, Nicholas Schaffner approved of the singer's gesture in donating his publishing royalties to the Material World Charitable Foundation and praised the album's [...] "exquisite musical underpinnings". Although the [...] "transcendent dogma" [...] was not always to his taste, Schaffner recognised that in Living in the Material World, Harrison had [...] "devised a luxuriant rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple".|$|E

As he leaves for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl, Sarah (Rochelle Davis), who says that she is their friend, and that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of her.|$|E
60|$|Presently, {{about two}} in the afternoon, came a fierce yelling of Indians {{to the west of}} the fort, and the redskins could be seen moving through the forest, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> not to expose themselves too much to an attack.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> not to {{approach}} {{the place where they}} had thrown Montgomery into the water, but instead, carried the four dead Beast People slantingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards before they waded out and cast them away.|$|R
5000|$|The family I {{had never}} had, {{the one that}} never cared for me, I said that <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of me, gave me housing. That's why I made the {{decision}} to return. I thought that corresponded because I had to be working and these people gave me housing, they cared for me, because if something happened, I cut a finger or {{had to go to the}} doctor they accompanied me ... <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> that I did not spread disease, that I did not catch any infection, I did not catch the flu. When the snowy season began, they would tell me to go get the vaccine or take something so I would not get sick.|$|R
2500|$|After {{violence}} at the Coronado and Emmet Mines in Leadville killed four strikers and one fireman, Smith {{wrote to a}} London business contact, [...] "The strikers got {{the worst of it}} in the raid on the Coronado and Emmet, there were 10 or 12 killed; {{we do not know how}} many, and a great number wounded; <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of their wounded the same as the Indians but every now and then a fellow turns up that the rats have been eating or who has gone to decay that we know must have been shot..." [...] Philpott concluded the remarks suggest [...] "that Smith looked on the miners as almost subhuman. Certainly there is no hint of empathy in these words." ...|$|E

60|$|As the men {{believed}} her, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to keep well {{on their}} guard while engaged in the search. Poor old Mrs Blyth looked absolutely horror-stricken at this invasion of her cottage, and Nelly stood beside her, pale as marble and trembling with anxiety.|$|R

6000|$|What {{would they}} do with it? It might drive them crazy. As they now lived they were comfortable.

6000|$|... "There is no {{immediate}} danger," [...] he said, {{in answer to}} our questioning. [...] "One doesn't know how much she took. It may be that she will get off with a fright. Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> not to succeed. It's generally a gesture to arouse pity or terror in their lover." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{was confirmed}} by Popes Alexander III in 1165, Urban IV in 1264, Clement IV and Boniface VIII. Among the privileges of the monks was that of electing the abbot and the prior, which <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to have confirmed in 1498 by Louis XII.|$|R

Chris is stunned by the news.|$|R
60|$|There it stops. What {{did they}} do with those poor little fellows? What was their {{subsequent}} history? Did they purpose training them up as Thugs? How could <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of such little creatures on a march which stretched over several months? No one seems to have cared to ask any questions about the babies. But I do wish I knew.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} Bessie as, I am sorry to say, I do," [...] said Alick, {{speaking}} slowly and sadly, and with a flush of shame on his cheek.

60|$|This is what I say brings land {{so much in}} debt to trade, and obliges the {{tradesman}} to {{take credit}} of one another; and yet they do not lose by it neither, for the tradesmen {{find it in the}} price, and <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> to make such families pay warmly for the credit, in the rate of their goods; nor can it be expected it should be otherwise, for unless the profit answered it, the tradesman could not afford to be so long without his money.|$|E
