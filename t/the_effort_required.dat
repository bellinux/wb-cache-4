5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing the tools to make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, the Telefon Hírmondó {{employed}} about 180 {{people during}} winter and 150 in the summer. The staff {{consisted of a}} business manager, an editor-in-chief, four assistant editors, and nine reporters. The only ladies among the staff were those who sang in the concerts. At this time the service employed six stentors in the winter: four for duty, and two for alternates. Due to <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to speak loudly into the transmitters, readers took turns of ten minutes each. The stentors had strong and clear voices with distinct articulation to maintain clarity of sound over the telephone lines. In the summer, four stentors sufficed. In cases where only two stentors were on duty, they took turns of half an hour maximum. By 1907, the system had a staff of over two hundred people, including two business managers, two principal editors, six sub-editors, twelve reporters, and eight stentors.|$|E

25|$|Sacrificial rituals {{among the}} Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, {{must be seen}} in the context of {{religious}} cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For {{some of the most important}} rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer a human life or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might be a war captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.|$|E
25|$|In free diving (breathhold) {{the weight}} system is almost {{exclusively}} a weight belt with quick release buckle, as the emergency {{release of the}} weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where {{there is at least}} a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the exposure suit, as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most free divers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to swim down against the buoyancy {{at the start of a}} dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back up to where the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.|$|E
25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers allow {{themselves}} to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem.|$|E

25|$|Basically {{the same}} Coalition, again {{led by the}} Republic and what now became Great Britain, soon fought France again in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the States Army reached its {{greatest}} power and size: 119,000 men in 1712. It therefore formed {{the backbone of the}} Anglo-Dutch forces in the Southern Netherlands, led by the Duke of Marlborough (while the Republic also paid for many of the troops supplied by the allied German princes and Denmark, by way of subsidies); the British contribution was usually smaller in size at most of the battles fought during this conflict. <b>The</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> from the Republic in this war almost brought it to financial exhaustion, just as France was financially brought to its knees. This, {{and the fact that the}} fruits of the allied victory over France were almost exclusively reaped by Great Britain (that had turned its back on its allies and concluded a separate peace) so disillusioned the Dutch government, that they decided to turn their back on European power politics for the remainder of the 18th century, adopting a policy of armed neutrality.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E

500|$|Development of Super Meat Boy {{began in}} January 2009. Initially {{announced}} for WiiWare and PC, {{the game was}} set {{to be released in}} the first quarter of 2010. The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels, such as the dark worlds. A picture released on Team Meat's Twitter page on February 22, 2010, revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA. The next day, they announced that, while all versions would be released in the same month, the game would be released for XBLA first due to [...] "contractual obligations". In August 2010, the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft's 2010 Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later. As they were almost out of money, they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event, but felt they had four months' worth of work left to complete on the game. For the final two months of development they worked daily, slept five hours a night, and frequently forgot to eat—a process that McMillen said he [...] "would never voluntarily go through" [...] again. According to McMillen, due to Microsoft's low expectations for the game, Super Meat Boy was lightly promoted. The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast, though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event. The team described <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>required</b> to finish the game for the promotion as [...] "by far the biggest mistake [...] made during SMB's development".
