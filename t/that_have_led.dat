5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E

25|$|A common {{feature of}} many Australian {{languages}} {{is that they}} display so-called avoidance speech, special speech registers used only {{in the presence of}} certain close relatives. These registers share the phonology and grammar of the standard language, but the lexicon is different and usually very restricted. There are also commonly speech taboos during extended periods of mourning or initiation <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to numerous Aboriginal sign languages.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, one may {{restrict}} or forbid {{the use of}} some of {{the structural}} rules. This yields a variety of substructural logic systems. They are generally weaker than LK (i.e., they have fewer theorems), and thus not complete with respect to the standard semantics of first-order logic. However, they have other interesting properties <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to applications in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.|$|E

25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated. A second's primary duty was {{to prevent the}} duel from actually happening, and only when both combatants were unwilling to stand down were they {{to make sure that}} the duel proceeded according to formalised rules. A challenger's second should therefore always ask the challenged party if he wants to apologise for his actions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the challenge.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{firms and}} {{businesses}} generally hire Filipino women for less pay and secretarial functions. But at present, Filipino women {{are given the}} same opportunities as their male counterparts in the business realm.

Tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always {{must be aware of}} road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision, as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles, bicycles, and pedestrians. However, critics such as scientist Andrew Ng have accused Tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security.|$|E
25|$|Some poor Latin American {{women are}} {{involved}} in illegal activities such as prostitution and gang criminality from their childhood, {{in order to support}} themselves and their families.

Child prostitution continues to be a serious social problem in the region today, and many of the human rights organizations have criticized the fact that this problem has not been properly addressed by most Latin American governments.|$|E

25|$|Reductions in {{populations of}} C. mydas are {{recorded}} in every ocean ecosystem they inhabit, and the contributing factors <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to their decline are all anthropogenic.

The most common accidental threat is the entanglement in fishing equipment with the most harmful methods being drift netting, shrimp trawling, long-lining, and dynamite fishing. Many pieces of legislation now ban these practices in protected areas.|$|E

In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E
25|$|The {{state-owned}} Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) acquired {{shares in}} oil fields {{in countries like}} Sudan, Syria, Iran, and Nigeria – investments <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to diplomatic tensions with the United States. Because of political instability in the Middle East and increasing domestic demand for energy, India is keen on decreasing its dependency on OPEC to meet its oil demand, and increasing its energy security. Several Indian oil companies, primarily led by ONGC and Reliance Industries, have started a massive hunt for oil in several regions in India, including Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari Basin and north-eastern Himalayas.

25|$|The first {{arrival of}} Islam in the South Asia {{took place in}} Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

The site is home to a number of ancient tombs and graves of Islamic dynasties. The Talpur Mirs of Hyderabad also left a number of sites including, Tombs of Talpur Mirs, Faiz Mahal in Khairpur, Qasim fort, Pacco Qillo and the Kot Diji Fort in Kot Diji. Another famous fort built during the Islam invasion was the Ranikot Fort. Like other provinces, Sindh has a number of cultural shrines and mausoleums including Thatta, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, Lal Shahbaz Qalander, Shahjahan Mosque, Mazar-e-Quaid, Minar-e-Mir Masum Shah, Bhambore and Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.|$|E
25|$|A {{large-scale}} Capitol dome restoration project, {{the first}} extensive such work since 1959–1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration. As of 2012, $20 million in {{work around the}} skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair {{the exterior of the}} dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations, but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014. Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome. All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
