500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want {{to sit on the}} sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> need {{to do in order to}} do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E
500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brain first {{appeared}} in Doom Patrol #86 and was created by Arnold Drake and Bruno Premiani. Drake later commented, [...] "I used that same concept in a Jerry Lewis comic book, and in a Bob Hope comic I had a totem pole that talked to him. Often times, I wrote the same storylines for <b>the</b> comedy <b>stuff</b> that <b>I</b> wrote for <b>the</b> serious <b>stuff.</b> <b>I</b> just turned it on its head." ...|$|R

500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
2500|$|White {{is known}} for {{drinking}} Scotch {{as part of his}} act, as well as smoking cigars or cigarettes. He stated during his You Can't Fix Stupid show, [...] "Somebody asked what I was drinking. If the company that made <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> was drinking was paying me, I'd have it in their bottle and not mine. But it's the kind of scotch that people drink that are going to die penniless. It's good though!" [...] In 2009 Comedy Central released Ron's stand up DVD Behavioral Problems.|$|E
2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is no way that I could ever play again a lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|E

2500|$|The dark {{theme of}} the album was {{balanced}} by [...] "Every Little Thing", which Unterberger describes as a [...] "celebration of what a wonderful girl the guy has". McCartney said of the song: [...] "'Every Little Thing', like most of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> did, was my attempt at the next single... but it became an album filler rather than the great almighty single. It didn't have quite what was required." [...] Musicologist Walter Everett says the chorus' incorporation of [...] "leaden" [...] parallel fifth harmonies, supported by Starr's timpani, was the inspiration for a proto-heavy metal version of the song recorded by the English progressive rock band Yes in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{earliest}} influence on comedy, Chappelle said, [...] "You know who was a big influence on me that is really weird is Bugs Bunny, That's just weird. If you {{watch a lot of}} <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> do, you can almost see the influence in it, Because these animators would animate these performances that were off the hook, And the guy that, the guy that did the voices was Mel Blanc. This guy was like some kind of savant or genius or something, But they had some kind of real big comedic influence on me, like I liked those cartoons, I think that was my first real big comedy influence, was a rabbit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, Stewart told Vibe {{that his}} and The-Dream's fellow {{production}} associate Kuk Harrell, would be producing {{a lot of}} the album. He said [...] "I heard him working on some of the vocals and {{she has a lot of}} really good songs, I will say that. <b>The</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> heard was really good, really strong." [...] Following Lopez's move to Island Def Jam, Lopez re-entered the studio to record new material with Harrell. Lopez later revealed that most of the album had been revamped and most production was now courtesy of Stewart and The-Dream despite recording several new songs with Moroccan producer RedOne, which made the album. Amongst those recorded with RedOne is the Latin music-influenced [...] "On the Floor" [...] which features Pitbull and a sample from Kaoma's 1989 hit single [...] "Lambada". Two other RedOne songs, co-written and co-produced by Lady Gaga, [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] and [...] "Hypnotico", also appear on Love? [...] "Hypnotico" [...] was originally recorded by recording artist Tami Chynn for her unreleased second album. Meanwhile, Lopez told fans in March 2011 that she recorded some of the album's songs in Spanish. Rap-Up revealed that the album was to also feature production from producer Troy [...] "Radio" [...] Johnson.|$|E

2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>I</b> came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E
