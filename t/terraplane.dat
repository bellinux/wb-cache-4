5000|$|Hudson {{vehicles}} were assembled {{in other countries}} under license. The British sounding names of [...] "Hudson" [...] and [...] "Essex" [...] had made them popular in countries of the Commonwealth, and thus <b>Terraplanes</b> also were built outside the U.S. in England and Australia in low volume. Australian law made it impractical to import a fully assembled car and thus main bodies were built by local craftsman at firms such as Ruskin Motor Bodies Ltd. and General Motors-Holden's Ltd, both of Melbourne, Victoria. In a few cases these bodies included styles not available in the U.S. market such as tourers (U.S. equivalent phaeton) and coupe utilities (the Australian car-based pickup truck).|$|R
2500|$|At the 1931 National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio she {{won four}} woman-only events and claimed $4,200 in prize money. [...] At the 1932 Nationals {{she won the}} most coveted prize in women's aviation, the Amelia Earhart Trophy, {{presented}} by Amelia Earhart herself and winning the grand prize of an Essex <b>Terraplane</b> automobile.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by blues musician Robert Johnson's 1936 [...] "Terraplane Blues." [...] A <b>Terraplane</b> is a classic car, and the song uses car parts as metaphors for sex—"pump your gas," [...] "rev all night," [...] etc. The themes of these songs however differ; [...] "Terraplane Blues" [...] is about infidelity, while [...] "Trampled Under Foot" [...] is about giving in to sexual temptation.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, {{knowing they}} were going to drop the <b>Terraplane,</b> Hudson {{management}} chose to phase out the <b>Terraplane</b> name similarly to how it had been introduced, and the 1938 cars were named Hudson-Terraplanes. Concurrently for the 1938 model year, Hudson offered a Model 112 which was virtually indistinguishable in equipment from the Hudson <b>Terraplane,</b> but on a shorter 112 in wheelbase and with a smaller engine. The <b>Terraplane</b> did not have an ammeter or an oil pressure gauge.|$|E
5000|$|For 1934 {{the word}} [...] "Essex" [...] was dropped {{and the car}} became the <b>Terraplane.</b> The cars were {{slightly}} heavier and rarely joined competitive events, particularly as they now lacked the eight-cylinder powerplant. The name <b>Terraplane</b> remained constant through the 1937 model year. By 1936, <b>Terraplane</b> commercial cars were produced in larger numbers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Terraplane</b> {{was a car}} {{brand and}} model built by the Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, between 1932 and 1938. In its maiden year, the car was branded as the Essex-Terraplane; in 1934 the car became simply the <b>Terraplane.</b> They were inexpensive, yet {{powerful}} vehicles {{that were used in}} both town and country, as both cars and trucks bore the <b>Terraplane</b> name.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937 (the {{first year}} of production), the {{automobile}} {{was known as the}} Hudson <b>Terraplane</b> Utility Coupe. It was one of 17 different models in the <b>Terraplane</b> line (nine in the [...] "Deluxe"/Series 71 line and eight in the [...] "Super Terraplane"/Series 72).|$|E

50|$|In 1932, Hudson began {{phasing out}} its Essex {{nameplate}} {{for the modern}} <b>Terraplane</b> brand name. The new line was launched on July 21, 1932, with a promotional christening by Amelia Earhart. For 1932 and 1933, the restyled cars were named Essex-Terraplane; from 1934 as <b>Terraplane,</b> until 1938 when the <b>Terraplane</b> was renamed the Hudson 112. Hudson also began assembling cars in Canada, contracting Canada Top and Body to build the cars in their Tilbury, Ontario, plant. In England Terraplanes built at the Brentford factory were still being advertised in 1938.|$|E

5000|$|Johnson {{used the}} car model <b>Terraplane</b> {{as a metaphor}} for sex. In the lyrical narrative, the car will not start and Johnson {{suspects}} that his girlfriend let another man drive it when he was gone. In describing the various mechanical problems with his <b>Terraplane,</b> Johnson creates a setting of thinly veiled sexual innuendo. The guitar parts in [...] "Terraplane Blues" [...] are similar to those in Johnson's [...] "Stones in My Passway".|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Terraplane</b> contributed {{greatly to}} Hudson Motor's sales during the Depression 1930s. Sales of the <b>Terraplane</b> outpaced Hudson {{vehicles}} in the late mid-1930s and {{it is said that}} Hudson management was not fond of that fact and that was partly why they chose to eliminate the car as a make. One unique feature was [...] "Duo-Automatic" [...] brakes. Terraplanes had two brake systems—hydraulic and mechanical. Should the hydraulic brakes fail (i.e. the brake line had a leak in it), the mechanical brakes would be used to stop the car.|$|E
50|$|For the 1939 model year, the <b>Terraplane</b> brand {{was dropped}} for both trucks and autos, and the vehicle {{was called the}} Hudson Utility Coupe {{for the rest of}} its {{production}} cycle.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, the Hudson <b>Terraplane</b> {{came with}} the first back-up brake system. Should the {{hydraulic}} brakes fail, the brake pedal would activate a set of mechanical brakes for the back wheels.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Terraplane,</b> {{published}} in 1988, is a Jack Womack science fiction novel. The <b>Terraplane</b> is a 1930s automobile, which plays {{a significant role}} in this novel. It is also a time machine from the corporate-dominated future of DryCo, a manipulative multinational corporation in [...] "New" [...] New York City, 2033 CE. In this future, climate change has resulted in rising sea levels, and would have inundated the original city {{if it had not been}} for the massive construction of a giant seawall, and New New York on higher ground. Altogether, Jack Womack set four novels in a quartet series in this future world, and its alternate history liaisons.|$|E
