Eventually, she comes to identify a cipher based on her childhood name, Olive, that identifies Newton and the other slain shapeshifters, and one {{that has yet to}} be killed. Fringe begins to descend on his residence.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|These {{molecules}} are rod-shaped, some {{created in}} <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two {{new types of}} LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: disc-shaped (created by S. Chandrasekhar's group in India, 1977) and bowl-shaped (invented by Lui Lam in China, 1982, and synthesized in Europe three years later).|$|E
50|$|The {{initial draft}} report was {{somewhat}} critical of <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> <b>and</b> centers, whose lobbyists encouraged Congress {{to restrict the}} Council's authority. Subsequently the Council's purpose was changed; its supervisory responsibility over <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> <b>and</b> centers was stripped, and it became merely the National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement.|$|R
50|$|The National Council on Educational Research (NCER) {{was part}} of the U.S. Department of Education. The Council was {{originally}} tasked with overseeing the activities of <b>the</b> educational <b>Labs</b> <b>and</b> Centers established by Congress, the largest of which was the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory located in Portland, Oregon. Although <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> <b>and</b> centers had budgets sometimes in the millions of dollars (largely from Congress) the Council, itself, was a very small body, consisting of just two or three permanent staff members. The Council members were presidential appointees confirmed by Congress. Historically, the Council met infrequently, and rarely did more than endorse what <b>the</b> <b>labs</b> <b>and</b> centers chose to do.|$|R

5|$|Mulder and Trepkos {{arrive on}} the scene. Mulder radios the {{evacuation}} team but—knowing that Trepkos will refuse to go—reports that only he and Scully have survived the ordeal. The agents enter a month-long quarantine while the Chemical Corps confiscates <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> cordons off Mount Avalon. Firewalker is salvaged, but is too damaged to yield sufficient data. Trepkos and O'Neil are officially unaccounted for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The revamped Library, {{opened in}} 2013, {{features}} dedicated study areas, a small platform to hold forums and press conferences, {{as well as}} three discussion rooms available for student-teacher consultations, projects and group studies. The Nest, a dedicated maker-space which was opened in March 2017, allows students to design, construct or modify meaningful or handy items with specialised tools in <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> <b>and</b> supports the school's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Applied Learning Programme (STEM ALP).|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|While Eddie goes in pursuit, Peter {{manages to}} slip out and goes after Connors as Spider-Man. While trying to {{communicate}} with him, they end up on a subway train fighting both inside, outside, and underneath it. Finally, Spider-Man falls off the train and Connors escapes. Spider-Man returns to <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> is given a gene cleanser from Martha which must be administered to Connors orally. He then goes off to Bronx Zoo, where Connors is reportedly at.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|Bond escapes {{and calls}} Blofeld, using a similar {{electronic}} device made by Q to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte is kept at his summer house {{outside the city}} and goes there with Felix and the CIA. After a brief battle with Whyte's female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, they rescue Whyte. Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuring gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's storage unit, thawing his remains. Roland returns to <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> {{is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> requests to speak to Walter.|$|E

25|$|Digital {{protective}} relays {{were in their}} infancy during the late 1960s. An experimental digital protection system was tested in <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> {{in the field in}} the early 1970s. Unlike the relays mentioned above, digital {{protective relays}} have two main parts: hardware and software. The world's first commercially available digital protective relay was introduced to the power industry in 1984. In spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions the microprocessor based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 1970, near 3:40am, a bomb {{exploded}} next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.

Steinmetz also chaired the city's school board. A separate public park in Schenectady, known as The Steinmetz Park, is located on Lenox Road but is outside the GE Realty Plot district.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the moment}} they get there, the Negativitron attacks and sucks up some of <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> <b>and</b> the Sackbots, mutating some of them into Meanies. Victoria, after {{escaping}} on her train, tells the group {{that they need to}} get into the factory and shut down the machine making the Meanies. After shutting it down, though, the Negativitron makes the machine come alive into a spider-like creature that scales the wall of the laboratory. After destroying the machine, they find out that the Negativitron has taken the Sackbots to The Factory Of A Better Tomorrow.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Gale's murder, Gus brings both Walt and Jesse to <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> <b>and</b> kills his associate Victor {{right in front of}} them in a gruesome show of force. The tension of working under tighter security creates a rift between Walt and Jesse, and Gus uses the opportunity to bring Jesse to his side by having Mike train him in hopes of eventually replacing Walt. Walt figures out what Gus is up to and gives Jesse homemade ricin with which to poison Gus, but Jesse never goes through with it. Meanwhile, Walt buys the car wash where he used to work and uses it to launder his drug money.|$|E
