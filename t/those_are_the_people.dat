I was giving you an illustration of myself in action, my dear. I went to these Nervino people--happened to see one of their posters and got the idea in a flash--I went to them and said, 'Here am I, a presentable man of persuasive manners and a large acquaintance among the leaders of New York Society. What would it be worth to you to have me hint from time to time at dinner parties and so forth that Nervino is the rich man's panacea?' I put the thing lucidly to them. I said, 'No doubt you have a thousand agents in the city, but have you one who does not look like an agent and won't talk like an agent? Have you one who is inside the houses of the wealthy, at their very dinner-tables, instead of being on the front step, trying to hold the door open with his foot? That is the point you have to consider.' They saw the idea at once. We arranged terms--not as generous as I could wish, perhaps, but quite ample. I receive a tolerably satisfactory salary each week, and in return I spread the good word about Nervino in the gilded palaces of the rich. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> to go for, Jill.

You catch one of them after dinner, just as he is wondering if he was really wise in taking two helpings of the lobster Newburg, and he is clay in your hands. I draw my chair up to his and become sympathetic and say that I had precisely the same trouble myself until recently, and mention a dear old friend of mine who died of indigestion, and gradually lead the conversation round to Nervino. I don't force it on them. I don't even ask them, to try it. I merely point to myself, rosy with health, and say that I owe everything to it, and the thing is done.

50|$|Carlo Ginzburg's {{researches}} {{have highlighted}} shamanic elements in European witchcraft compatible with (although not invariably inclusive of) drug-induced altered states of consciousness. In this context, a persistent theme in European witchcraft, stretching {{back to the}} time of classical authors such as Apuleius,is the use of unguents conferring the power of 'flight' and 'shape-shifting'. A number of recipes for such 'flying ointments have survived from early modern times, permitting not only an assessment of their likely pharmacological effects - based on their various plant (and to a lesser extent animal) ingredients - but also the actual recreation of and experimentation with such fat or oil-based preparations. It <b>is</b> surprising (given <b>the</b> relative wealth of material available) that Ginzburg makes only the most fleeting of references to the use of entheogens in European witchcraft {{at the very end of}} his extraordinarily wide-ranging and detailed analysis of the Witches Sabbath, mentioning only the fungi Claviceps purpurea and Amanita muscaria by name, and confining himself to but a single paragraph on the 'flying ointment' on page 303 of 'Ecstasies...' :In the Sabbath the judges more and more frequently saw the accounts of real, physical events. For a long time the only dissenting voices <b>were</b> <b>those</b> of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who, referring back to the Canon episcopi, saw witches and sorcerers as the victims of demonic illusion. In the sixteenth century scientists like Cardano or Della Porta formulated a different opinion : animal metamorphoses, flights, apparitions of <b>the</b> devil <b>were</b> <b>the</b> effect of malnutrition or the use of hallucinogenic substances contained in vegetable concoctions or ointments...But no form of privation, no substance, no ecstatic technique can, by itself, cause the recurrence of such complex experiences...the deliberate use of psychotropic or hallucinogenic substances, while not explaining the ecstasies of the followers of the nocturnal goddess, the werewolf, and so on, would place them in a not exclusively mythical dimension.- in short, a substrate of shamanic myth could, when catalysed by a drug experience (or simple starvation), give rise to a 'journey to the Sabbath', not of the body, but of the mind. Ergot and the Fly Agaric mushroom, while undoubtedly hallucinogenic, <b>were</b> not among <b>the</b> ingredients listed in recipes for the flying ointment. The active ingredients in such unguents were primarily, not fungi, but plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, most commonly Atropa belladonna (Deadly Nightshade) and Hyoscyamus niger (Henbane), belonging to the tropane alkaloid-rich tribe Hyoscyameae. Other tropane-containing, nightshade ingredients included the famous Mandrake Mandragora officinarum, Scopolia carniolica and Datura stramonium, the Thornapple.The alkaloids Atropine, Hyoscyamine and Scopolamine present in these Solanaceous plants are not only potent (and highly toxic) hallucinogens, but are also fat-soluble and capable of being absorbed through unbroken human skin.|$|R

40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. The {{importance}} of <b>the</b> Trinity cannot <b>be</b> overemphasised in <b>the</b> matter of salvation. We cannot {{talk about a}} salvation if we cannot talk about a Trinity. Paul thinks of salvation only in trinitarian categories. For {{the purpose of this}} treatise, we call it a Soteriological Trinity. Paul takes the soteriological trinity {{as a matter of fact}} because he ascribes deity to both Christ and the Holy Spirit without denying his monotheistic background or beliefs. For Paul, God's dealing with <b>people</b> in <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> to call a people for his own name. These <b>are</b> called <b>the</b> <b>People</b> of God, and <b>is</b> identified with <b>the</b> Body of Christ and the Temple of the Holy Spirit, the Church. <b>The</b> Holy Spirit <b>is</b> instrumental in constituting this People, or Body, or Temple. Because of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the gift of the promised Holy Spirit, this People is defined as an eschatological community, and salvation is an eschatological event. Through these events, the future and <b>the</b> kingdom <b>is</b> present in <b>the</b> here and now ("already"), while there is still a "not yet" aspect to that future. This society, <b>the</b> Church, <b>is</b> therefore a reflection of the Divine Trinity. They reflect God's unity, love, grace, kingdom and more in this world. Because the community of believers is a Spirit-instituted, Spirit-sealed, Spirit-quickened, Spirit-initiated, Spirit-controlled and Spirit-endowed community, they characterise the New Age, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> age of the New Covenant and the age of the Spirit. That means that our obedience to God is internally motivated rather than by external codes or requirements of law. <b>The</b> Church <b>is,</b> really then, <b>the</b> beneficiaries of God's grace, thus making them a charismatic community. Salvation is by God's grace. Sanctification is by God's grace. Security is ours by God's grace. In fact for Paul, the whole of <b>the</b> Christian life <b>is</b> a matter of God's grace. He calls it "the riches of the glory of God's grace" (Eph. 1 : 7). Grace <b>is</b> <b>the</b> antithesis of the Law. Paul's own experience of Christ and the Spirit, changed his whole understanding of God, <b>the</b> <b>People</b> of God, and <b>the</b> Law. God <b>was</b> now understood as a trinity; <b>the</b> <b>People</b> of God now consisted of both Jews and Gentiles; and the Law, though holy and good, <b>was</b> weak through <b>the</b> flesh, and unable to bring salvation. In fact, the Law brought death and bondage, rather than life and liberty. The Spirit of life and liberty set us free from the law of sin and death. The Spirit, life and liberty are then gifts of grace. We now have to live as free, not using our freedom as a 'cloak of maliciousness', but to bring honour to God. Freedom <b>was</b> for Paul <b>the</b> mark of sonship, and bondage of slavery. We are sons and not slaves. Through <b>the</b> Spirit we <b>were</b> made sons of God, and are being fashioned after the image of the true Son of God. All of the Spirit's operations in <b>the</b> Church, <b>are</b> to this end. Whether to give us life, or to place us in Christ's Body, or to unite believers to Christ and to each other, or to give gifts for the building up of the saints and for the work of the ministry, or to lead and control us, or to have us bear spiritual fruit, a to reveal to us the mysteries of God, it <b>is</b> so that <b>the</b> Body and <b>the</b> individual believer <b>be</b> conformed to Christ's likeness. All these operations are done in conjunction with the Father and the Son. The Kingdom of God <b>is</b> for Paul <b>the</b> final goal of the relationship between the Spirit, Christ and <b>the</b> <b>People</b> of God. So that God's righteousness and rule <b>be</b> <b>the</b> culmination of it all. The Kingdom of God is nevertheless a present reality, in that righteousness, peace and joy <b>are</b> already <b>the</b> experience of the Church. Yet, the future of the believers' participation in <b>the</b> Kingdom, <b>is</b> guaranteed by their participation with the Holy Spirit in the present. Through this present participation with <b>the</b> Spirit, <b>are</b> we guaranteed of the future bodily resurrection, inheritance and eternal life. Our participation in the "firstfruits" guarantees our participation in the "harvest". When <b>the</b> Holy Spirit <b>is</b> involved in <b>the</b> world, he <b>is</b> involved with <b>the</b> task of the Kingdom; the calling of <b>those</b> who will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> for God's Name. The Holy Spirit makes the Word understandable and appropriate for salvation through the Gospel. He gives life which opens them up for his work in them to bring about their identification with Christ, the Lord and King. <b>The</b> Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> key to true spirituality and Christ-likeness. <b>The</b> Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> key to the future...|$|R
