5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction.

Although viewed with reserve by {{many of his colleagues}} there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form.

5|$|As {{speculation}} of {{a move to}} Hibernian came {{to nothing}} (despite his being installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell {{at the end of}} June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales.

The club had sold off some of their best players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought in Peter Ward as assistant manager.|$|E

5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728.

His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
