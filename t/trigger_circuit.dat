50|$|The UJT is {{not used}} as a linear amplifier. It is used in {{free-running}} oscillators, synchronized or triggered oscillators, and pulse generation circuits at low to moderate frequencies (hundreds of kilohertz). It is widely used in the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuits</b> for silicon controlled rectifiers. The low cost per unit, combined with its unique characteristic, have warranted its use {{in a wide variety}} of applications like oscillators, pulse generators, saw-tooth generators, <b>triggering</b> <b>circuits,</b> phase control, timing circuits, and voltage- or current-regulated supplies. The original unijunction transistor types are now considered obsolete, but a later multi-layer device, the programmable unijunction transistor (PUT), is still widely available.|$|R
50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging <b>circuit,</b> a <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> receives the <b>triggering</b> signal, the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|R
2500|$|Collector {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed to the collector via a fast switching diode , possibly after being {{shaped by a}} pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was extensively employed in first generation circuits since the collector node has a high impedance and also collector capacitance [...] behaves quite linearly under large signal regime. As a consequence of this, the delay time from input to output is very small and approximately independent {{of the value of}} control voltage. However, this <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> requires a diode capable of resist to high reverse voltages and switch very fast, characteristics that are very difficult to realize in the same diode, therefore it is rarely seen in modern avalanche transistor circuits.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{comparator}} {{does not}} have internal hysteresis or if the input noise {{is greater than the}} internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting Schmitt <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E

The circuit uses only 1 -phi sensing, to generate the triggering pulses necessary for 3 -phi converters working under variable frequency supply and the firing pulses are spaced equidistantly. The circuit is inherently immune to noise and transients, due to the use of CMOS integrated circuits and optocouplers.
