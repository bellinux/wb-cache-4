40|$|A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> {{is defined}} as a {{functional}} entity with an associated physical structure, where the operators carry out <b>the</b> centralized <b>control,</b> monitoring and administrative responsibilities. Emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> acts as an alternative <b>control</b> <b>room</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of shutting down or maintaining the facility in a safe shutdown state when <b>the</b> main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is uninhabitable. <b>The</b> mission of emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is to provide the resources to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition after an evacuation of <b>the</b> main <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> An evacuation of <b>the</b> main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is assumed when there is no possibility to accomplish tasks involved in the shutdown except reactor trip. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a specific approach for the design of <b>the</b> emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> of a nuclear reactor used to produce radioisotope. The approach is based on human factors standards and the participation of a multidisciplinary team in the development phase of the design.

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E
