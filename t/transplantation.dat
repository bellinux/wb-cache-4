5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell <b>transplantation</b> is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although <b>transplantation</b> is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
5|$|Liver <b>transplantation</b> is an {{effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure.

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of HSCT: syngeneic, autologous, and {{allogeneic}} transplants. [...] Syngeneic <b>transplantations</b> occur between identical twins. Autologous <b>transplantations</b> use the HSCs obtained directly from the patient and hence do not cause any complications of tissue incompatibility; whereas allogeneic <b>transplantations</b> involve the use of donor HSCs, either genetically related or unrelated to the recipient. To lower the risks of transplant, which include graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT must satisfy compatibility at the HLA loci (i.e. genetic matching to reduce the immunogenicity of the transplant). Mismatch of HLA loci would result in treatment-related mortality and higher risk of acute GVHD.|$|R

5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver <b>transplantation,</b> although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until <b>transplantation</b> can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} heart <b>transplantation</b> {{was performed in}} 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in cardiac surgery, capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive {{for more than a}} few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve <b>transplantation</b> techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transplantation</b> rates {{also differ}} based on race, sex, and income. A study done with people {{beginning}} long term dialysis {{showed that the}} sociodemographic barriers to renal <b>transplantation</b> present themselves even before patients are on the transplant list. For example, different groups express definite interest and complete pretransplant workup at different rates. Previous efforts to create fair <b>transplantation</b> policies had focused on people currently on the <b>transplantation</b> waiting list.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} {{cannot be}} controlled {{or when the}} liver ceases functioning, liver <b>transplantation</b> is necessary. Survival from liver <b>transplantation</b> has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for <b>transplantation.</b> <b>Transplantation</b> necessitates the use of immune suppressants (ciclosporin or tacrolimus).|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} <b>transplantation</b> has changed {{survival}} from {{as low as}} 15% in the pretransplant era to more than 60% today.

In addition to <b>transplantation,</b> better critical care and the trend toward more benign causes, such as acetaminophen, all contribute to improved survival rates. Spontaneous survival is now around 40%. The application of <b>transplantation</b> among patients with ALF remains low, suggesting that the full potential of this modality may not be realized. Timely availability of an allograft {{is one of the}} major factors determining transplant outcomes. In the largest U.S. study, only 29% of patients received a liver graft, while 10% of the overall group (one fourth of patients listed for <b>transplantation)</b> died on the waiting list.

25|$|Liver <b>transplantation</b> or hepatic <b>transplantation</b> is the {{replacement}} of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (allograft). Liver <b>transplantation</b> is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. The most common technique is orthotopic <b>transplantation,</b> in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic position as the original liver. The surgical procedure is complex, requiring careful harvest of the donor organ and meticulous implantation into the recipient. Liver <b>transplantation</b> is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians and supporting medical team. The duration of the surgery ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipient, {{as well as a}} well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.|$|E
