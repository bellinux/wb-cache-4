Here it is--The Author of the Sinner's Friend; it is {{a memoir}} {{of the man who}} wrote a little book called The Sinner's Friend," [...] said the colporteur, {{producing}} a <b>thin</b> <b>booklet</b> in paper cover, [...] "but I'd recommend a Bible along with it, because the Bible tells of the sinner's best friend, Jesus, and remember that without Him you can do nothing. He is God, and it is `God who giveth us the victory.' You can't do it by yourself, if you try ever so much." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{originated}} as Mission England Praise, {{prepared for}} Billy Graham's 1984 Mission England campaign. In its [...] "words only" [...] form, {{it was a}} <b>thin</b> <b>booklet</b> of 282 pieces, with a wide mixture of hymns and worship songs. Some conservative Christians {{saw it as a}} way of bringing what they perceived as charismatic choruses into mainstream church worship.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the plastic Western playing card into the Japanese market. Western playing cards were still a novelty in Japan and the public associated them with Western-styled gambling games such as poker and bridge. Most gambling activities were technically illegal by default with only a few legally sanctioned exceptions (horse racing, pachinko and lottery). Therefore, the market for anything which was associated with gambling, including Hanafuda, was limited. Yamauchi’s first [...] "hit" [...] came when he made a licensing agreement with Walt Disney in 1959 for his plastic playing cards. Nintendo targeted its playing cards as a tool for party games that the whole family could enjoy, a foreshadowing of the company’s approach going into the 21st century. Disney’s tie-in was made towards that end. Nintendo’s Disney playing card was also accompanied by a small, <b>thin</b> <b>booklet</b> with many tutorials for different card games. The strategy succeeded and the product sold 600,000 units in one year, soon gracing Nintendo with the domination of Japanese playing card market. With this success, Yamauchi once again changed the company name to Nintendo Company Limited and took the company public (listed on stock market) and became the chairman. He then decided to travel to the U.S. to visit the United States Playing Card Company, the world’s biggest manufacturer of playing cards. Upon arriving in Cincinnati, Yamauchi was disappointed to see a small-scale office and factory. This led to the realisation that card manufacturing was an extremely limited venture.|$|E
50|$|In Leipzig Reiske worked mainly at Greek, {{though he}} {{continued}} to draw on his Arabic stores accumulated in Leiden. Yet his merit as an Arabist was sooner recognized than {{the value of his}} Greek work. Reiske the Greek scholar has been rightly valued only in recent years, and it is now recognized that he was the first German since Sylburg who had a living knowledge of the Greek tongue. His reputation does not rest on his numerous editions, often hasty or even made to booksellers' orders, but in his remarks, especially his conjectures. He himself designates the Animadversiones in scriptores Graecos as flos ingenii sui, and in truth these <b>thin</b> <b>booklets</b> outweigh his big editions.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, Wäscher {{worked for}} the Walter Lehning Verlag {{publishing}} house and created some of his best-known comics there: Sigurd, Nick, Tibor, Falk and countless others {{that appeared in the}} Piccolo-format (<b>thin</b> <b>booklets</b> in landscape format) and with circulation numbers sometimes reaching the millions. He also continued the Akim series into its 40th issue after the Italian artist Augusto Pedrazza had produced the first 28 issues. The Sigurd series was published until 1960 with a total of 324 books and after 1958 received a reprint in 124 booklets in large format. Later [...] "Sigurd" [...] also appeared as a radio drama in Germany. The earliest issues of [...] "Sigurd" [...] have been auctioned for as much as 3,000 Euro. Other Wäscher comics also reach high prices in auction. In 2011 the [...] "Sigurd" [...] Piccolo booklets were released as an iPhone-App in Germany.|$|R

50|$|The first Beat Scene and {{subsequent}} four issues were <b>thin</b> A5 <b>booklets.</b> Initially, {{there were only}} 200 copies produced and hand assembled on Ring's kitchen table.As well as the principal Beat writers: Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, the magazine has featured Lord Buckley, James Jones, Chet Baker, Richard Brautigan, Lew Welch, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lenny Bruce, Ken Kesey, Jack Hirschman, Raymond Carver, Robert Frank, Gregory Corso, Diane Di Prima, Jack Micheline and Carolyn Cassady (who {{was the first of}} the magazine’s interview subjects).

50|$|Two years later, on 22 July 1889, the Director of the Statistical Bureau, Dr. Guillaume, {{presented}} a yearbook proposal divided into six theses to the Conference of Swiss statisticians in Aarau, which was adopted {{after a short}} discussion. The first thesis described {{the purpose of the}} publication: the Yearbook was supposed to inform the general public about the main results of Swiss statistics in easy-to-understand tables and comparable time series. Guillaume indicated that he had modelled the Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland on the Statistical Yearbook of Finland (a <b>thin</b> bilingual <b>booklet)</b> and the Statistical Yearbook of the German Reich (a more comprehensive volume with coloured maps).|$|R
