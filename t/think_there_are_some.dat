500|$|Spin {{gave the}} album {{seven out of}} 10 stars, writing that [...] "Everything you want is still there—goofy experimentalism, guitar frenzy, Eddie's self-abusive wail. It's just more solid, more clear." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three out of five stars, feeling that the album [...] "comes across {{as part of an}} {{extended}} conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam's latest musings on love, death and social responsibility." [...] The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam [...] "are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull" [...] and observing that [...] "Vedder's affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola." [...] The review called Binaural [...] "a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds." [...] At the 2001 Grammy Awards, [...] "Grievance" [...] received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Regarding Binaural, Ament stated that [...] "we look back and think we didn't put some of the best songs on it", adding that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> beautiful things that came out of it, but we're never going to remember that record as one of the greats." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis, McCain said its root cause was loose credit and greed. On January 31, 2008, he said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> greedy people on Wall Street that perhaps {{need to be}} punished." [...] He also praised the George W. Bush administration's handling of the crisis. McCain later addressed the situation in a speech: ...|$|E
2500|$|Benefiting {{from his}} spell in England, Malone {{returned}} to Shield cricket for Western Australia for the 1979–80 season. [...] World Series cricket players were playing with non-World Series Cricket players. [...] " [...] "I {{can see it}} being completely forgotten {{in a couple of}} months", said Malone. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> initial problems, particularly with selection, but once everyone plays against each other again in Shield competition, it'll be pretty clear who the better cricketers are.... When we are all playing together it'll be clear who should be in the side and who shouldn't be".|$|E
6000|$|... "No. He <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mystery {{about his}} parentage--that's all. Jude {{is going to}} tell him when he is a little older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> love lost {{between the}} master and man or {{mistress}} and maid nowadays," [...] our beaten antagonist feebly sneered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mistake," [...] said Lord Ragnall, {{staring at}} us. [...] "This is Sir Junius Fortescue, {{who used to}} be Mr. Fortescue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} about it, Gilbert?" [...] demanded Jane. [...] "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{children}} who really need a whipping now and then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't {{mean what}} she says," [...] said Mara; [...] "but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{objections}} {{in a young}} lady's name being given to a ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir, in {{the name}} of my scholars! And proud am I to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>SOME</b> of them, at least, that are really ANXIOUS to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it. From none of them, I should <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> story about a Sir Guy who was a king's friend. I never trouble myself about it. I hate aristocracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mistake," [...] said Augusta, hurriedly {{and with}} a slight blush. [...] "I am a second-class {{passenger}} on board this ship, and therefore cannot have the pleasure of sitting next to Lady Holmhurst." ...|$|R
60|$|I slept like a top, so soundly {{indeed that}} I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> kind of {{soporific}} in the pick-me-up {{which looked like}} sherry, especially as the others who had drunk of it also passed an excellent night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, dear, that I {{shall have}} to ask you to help me to do some shopping. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> stores near here. We had better drive to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh-h-h!" [...] said Peter Rabbit, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> beetles {{under that}} great flat stone where that little black string is {{sticking}} out. Now when I count three you grab that string and pull hard perhaps you'll find a beetle {{at the other}} end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. I have no trustee, {{but the one}} you saw on the {{day when}} you fraudulently married me. And his trust {{is not a very}} {{difficult}} one, for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> odd shillings or pence, if you are very particular.' ...|$|E
60|$|She drew up the kaross over me, again {{patted my}} hand in her motherly fashion and departed, still smiling, after which I went to sleep again, so dreamlessly that I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> native {{soporific}} in that soup.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} the truth of it, I do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> sort of a quarrel between them. Of course, I am not sure it is on Miss Ford's account. But they don't act as they used to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While I {{was rushing}} Rojas {{a couple of}} cowboys shot out the lamplights. A Mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt, I guess. Then I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> {{shooting}} from the rebels after the room was dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] {{returned}} Billie, [...] "but {{he did not}} forbid us to try {{the reeds}} round the other islands; there's a much bigger one, not {{a quarter of a}} mile up stream. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> beautiful sedges there where geese are likely to live. I'm sure I would choose to live in such a place if I was a goose." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} recount the play hole by hole, I <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{subjects}} {{that are too}} painful. It was pitiful to watch Vincent Jopp in his downfall. By {{the end of the}} first nine his lead had been reduced to one, and his antagonist, rendered a new man by success, was playing magnificent golf. On the next hole he drew level. Then with a superhuman effort Jopp contrived to halve the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth. It seemed as though his iron will might still assert itself, but on the fourteenth the end came.|$|E
6000|$|We were {{considering}} {{what to do}} with her, when William came to me. [...] "Hark thee, friend," [...] says he, [...] "thou hast made a fine piece of work of it now, hast thou not, to borrow thy neighbour's ship here just at thy neighbour's door, and never ask him leave? Now, dost thou not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> men-of-war in the port? Thou hast given them the alarm sufficiently; thou wilt have them upon thy back before night, depend upon it, to ask thee wherefore thou didst so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> risk of your forgetting him, which, perhaps, wouldn't be altogether unnatural. He's {{a long way}} off, which has often its effect, and there's no denying {{the fact that in}} many respects you and he are different." ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{of their}} peculiarities is {{their fear of}} traps and snares. Very often they will not spring upon an ox or a horse, simply because it is tied to a tree. They <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> trick {{when they see the}} animal is {{fastened}} by a rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} {{a woman who}} was {{constantly}} bullied by her husband who did not like him the better for it," [...] Miss Clapperclaw says. And though this speech has some of Clapp's usual sardonic humor in it, I can't but <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> truth in the remark.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{a horrible}} chap, Smith. That {{is the only}} word for him. I have had doubts about him ever since that night when he fainted--you remember, when you came down. I taxed him to-day, {{and he told me}} things that made my hair rise, and wanted me to stand in with him. I'm not strait-laced, but I am a clergyman's son, you know, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things which are quite beyond the pale. I only thank God that I found him out before it was too late, for he was to have married into my family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes all}} sorts of people to make a world, as I've often heard, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who could be spared," [...] Anne told her {{reflection}} in the east gable mirror that night. [...] "I wouldn't have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT score. I really don't know who or what is to be thanked for this. I did nothing to bring it about, and it's hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, boy," [...] Bill agreed. [...] "She {{has got a}} flag I haven't {{seen before}} at her masthead. It is white, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> red letters on it--her name, I suppose. 'Tis not often that a new barge comes up to Pitsea. She is a fine-looking craft," [...] he went on, as a turning in the creek brought her wholly into view. [...] "A {{first-class}} barge, I should say. Yes, {{there is no doubt}} about her being new. I should say, from the look of her spars, she cannot have made many trips up and down the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{believe the}} vessel {{lies in the}} inlet still. They have used her now and then. It is {{understood}} that they were warranted in seizing her, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> diplomatic pressure {{brought to bear on}} them, for they sent her crew home." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{a part of}} Mrs. Heep's humility, that she still wore weeds. Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had {{occurred}} since Mr. Heep's decease, she still wore weeds. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> compromise in the cap; but otherwise she was as weedy as {{in the early days}} of her mourning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{all hope}} for Jane is gone forever! I have passed a happy day, though a busy one, for I did begin to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> chance for me. A man cannot see Nelson without pulling up, and wishing to be {{something}} like him; but a prison {{is no place for}} promotion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not turn}} from you at all," [...] she said, {{speaking}} very carefully. [...] "I {{will ever be}} grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be his friend in all that I am able. But now that my father James More is come again, {{there is a difference}} to be made, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things said and done that would be better to be forgotten. But I will ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all that [...] . if it is not so much. [...] . Not that you will be caring! But I would not have you think of me too hard. It was true what you said to me, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember I was just a child. I would not like to lose your friendship, at all events." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [133] This {{expression}} has {{met with}} objections. I will not refer to [...] "Him who hath not Music in his soul," [...] but merely request the reader to recollect, for ten seconds, {{the features of the}} woman whom he believes to be the most beautiful; and, if he then does not comprehend fully what is feebly expressed in the above line, I shall be sorry for us both. For an eloquent passage in the latest work of the first female writer of this, perhaps of any, age, on the analogy (and the immediate comparison excited by that analogy) between [...] "painting and music," [...] see vol. iii. cap. 10, De l'Allemagne. And is not this connection still stronger with the original than the copy? with the colouring of Nature than of Art? After all, this is rather to be felt than described; still I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who will understand it, at least they would have done had they beheld the countenance whose speaking harmony suggested the idea; for this passage is not drawn from imagination but memory,{A} that mirror which Affliction dashes to the earth, and looking down upon the fragments, only beholds the reflection multiplied! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} read through all Mr. Tennyson's poems, {{which have been}} sent to me; but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things of a good deal of beauty in what I have seen. The misfortune is, that he has begun to write verses without very well {{understanding}} what metre is. Even if you write in a known and approved metre, the odds are, if you are not a metrist yourself, that you will not write harmonious verses; but to deal in new metres without considering what metre means and requires, is preposterous. What I would, with many wishes for success, prescribe to Tennyson,--indeed without it he can never be a poet in act,--is to write for {{the next two or three}} years in none but one or two well-known and strictly defined metres, such as the heroic couplet, the octave stanza, or the octo-syllabic measure of the Allegro and Penseroso. He would, probably, thus get imbued with a sensation, if not a sense, of metre without knowing it, just as Eton boys get to write such good Latin verses by conning Ovid and Tibullus. As it is, I can scarcely scan some of his verses.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> nothing now in {{the year}} but autumn and winter. I really begin to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> terrible change of climate coming upon the world for its sin, like another deluge. It will have its rainbow, I suppose, after its manner--promising not to darken the world again, and then not to drown.|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand {{substantially}} as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing <b>there,</b> and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> force in that view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{he is out}} of {{the house}} Miss Peters is giving her name at the front door. Put {{yourself}} in Jones' place. What does he think? He <b>is</b> suspicious. He <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> game on. He skips upstairs again, waits until Miss Peters has gone into your room, then stands outside and listens. How about that?" ...|$|R
