5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout {{had been reported}} at the prison {{on the evening of}} and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E
25|$|In late November, British {{become aware}} of a {{probable}} attack on Thailand by Japan because of the rapid buildup of Japanese troops in Indochina. On 1 December 1941, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan stated that he was uncertain where Thailand stood regarding allowing Japanese troops free passage through its territory, but was hopeful a clash could be avoided. Further negotiations took place between the Japanese diplomatic representative, Tamara, and Phibun on 2 December. Phibun was prepared <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> if Japan invaded the Kra Peninsula, but wanted them to avoid passing through the Bangkok Plain. After further discussions on 3 December, Phibun agreed to passage through Thailand, provided Thailand could regain the territories ceded in the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, as well as Burma's Shan State.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Gibbs and Vance order McGee to hack {{into the}} Mossad database, {{discovering}} that all five operatives Elbaz had claimed were rogue are still listed as active members and that Mantel {{was the only}} traitor. When confronted, Elbaz at first deflects, but when informed that [...] "Bodnar" [...] has been arrested in Berlin, admits that she had believed that he never left the United States. Realizing shortly {{after that it is}} Yaniv who is in custody, she explains that she had hoped that the other agencies' search in Rome would cause Ilan to let his guard down.

500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E
2500|$|Germany had a {{very large}} and well {{organized}} nursing service, with four main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, the secular DRK (Red Cross) and the [...] "Brown Nurses," [...] for committed Nazi women. Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Frontline medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close {{to the front lines}} and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the Iron Cross for heroism under fire. In contrast, the brief historiography Nurses in Nazi Germany by Bronwyn Rebekah McFarland-Icke (1999) focuses on the dilemmas of German nurses forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> while their incapacitated patients were murdered.|$|E
50|$|Corruption, {{according}} to a 2015 article in The Diplomat, is present {{in every aspect of}} Tajikistan's culture. Examples include students paying bribes for better grades, bribes for the release of prisoners, and “smugglers tipping border guards <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way” as well as many others. Freedom House said much the same thing in 2016, calling corruption a problem affecting every aspect of Tajik society.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, child {{prostitution}} is tolerated or ignored by the authorities. Reflecting an attitude which prevails in many developing countries, a judge from Honduras said, on condition of anonymity: [...] "If the victim child prostitute is older than 12, if he or she refuses to file a complaint and if the parents clearly profit from their child's commerce, we tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way".|$|R

2500|$|As {{one of the}} [...] "Laufen Six", Reid {{was then}} sent to Colditz Castle, {{designated}} Oflag IV-C, a special [...] "escape-proof" [...] camp, arriving there on 10 November 1940. It {{was not long before}} Reid attempted an escape. He bribed a seemingly willing German guard <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> On the night of 29 May 1941 twelve prisoners crawled through a sewer pipe from the canteen to an outer courtyard, planning to then descend a forty-foot wall, and then over another wall 12 feet high topped with barbed wire. However, although the guard had accepted the bribe, he also reported the escape plan to his superiors, and the Germans were waiting for them. After another spell in solitary, Reid accepted the position of Escape Officer, responsible for overseeing all British escape plans. Reid assisted in many escape attempts, some successful, until April 1942, when he was replaced as Escape Officer by fellow member of the [...] "Laufen Six" [...] Captain Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Howe.|$|E
2500|$|The coastal gentry, well-represented in the Ming court {{due to the}} {{abundance}} of successful imperial examination candidates from among their numbers, compounded their wealth by sponsoring the smugglers with seagoing vessels and profiteered by reselling the smuggled goods at a higher value, sometimes delaying or even refusing to pay the smugglers. They were {{able to keep the}} smugglers' dissatisfaction in check by cajolery, marriage alliances, and threatening to summon the Ming military on the smugglers. On the other hand, they protected themselves by hiring mercenaries as guards and bribing the local officials <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Zhu Wan, who became the Grand Coordinator of Zhejiang in 1547, called these gentry members [...] "pirates in gowns and caps" [...] (衣冠之盜), and identified them as the root cause of the coastal disturbances. In the 1540s, this gentry-led equilibrium began to fall apart as the dissatisfied smugglers went rogue from their gentry sponsors. The Veritable Records of the Ming points to a raid in 1547 as the start of the wokou troubles, where smugglers and foreigners burned down the Xie family estate in Yuyao after the prominent Xie clan (謝氏) refused to pay their debts to the smugglers and threatened to inform the government.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. [...] In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. [...] One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. [...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. [...] Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is [...] "an imminent danger to the public safety." [...] All DEA licensees [...] "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting {{into the hands of}} legitimate patients," [...] said Mark Trouville, former DEA {{special agent in charge of}} the Miami Field Division.
