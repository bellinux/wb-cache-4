5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden was among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds {{of the church and}} its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} honour the deeds and {{inspirational}} stories that unfolded in Changi during the war, the Changi Chapel and Museum {{was built in}} 1988 as a dedication to all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> and died in Singapore {{during the years of}} World War II. It also serves as an important educational institution and resource centre with documentation of significant events of the Japanese Occupation in Singapore. The Selarang Barracks Incident, Double Tenth Incident and other similar stories that were mentioned by the survivors of Changi Prison are retold on the storyboard displays for posterity. There are also showcases containing tools, materials and personal belongings of POWs and other artefacts related or used during World War II. The items displayed in the showcases were donated from organizations, POWs and their families, as well as other visitors.|$|E

5|$|Rivera {{recommended}} closing Presidio de los Tejas {{and reducing}} the number of soldiers at the other presidios. His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bahía, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, increasing the number of missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300Indians. Many of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> at the mission had nowhere else to go, and belonged to small tribes that have since become extinct.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, most meat in Korea {{was likely}} {{obtained}} through hunting and fishing.

25|$|The Germania (Latin title: De Origine et situ Germanorum) is an ethnographic {{work on the}} Germanic tribes {{outside the}} Roman Empire. The Germania fits within a {{classical}} ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as Herodotus and Julius Caesar. The book begins (chapters 127) {{with a description of}} the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> on the shores of the Baltic Sea, such as the Fenni. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his Agricola (chapters 1013).|$|E

50|$|Unfinished: Believing Is Only the Beginning (Thomas Nelson, March 2013), {{describes}} {{how to find}} a life of true significance and meaning. As he compares the <b>lives</b> of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in “the happiest place on earth” with the <b>lives</b> of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in chronic poverty, the author is especially concerned that fellow Christians acknowledge their comparative wealth as they respond with compassion.|$|R

25|$|The {{identity}} of ethnic Serbs was historically {{largely based on}} Orthodox Christianity and on the Serbian Church in particular, {{to the extent of}} the claims that those who are not its faithful are not Serbs. The conversion of the South Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the Great Schism, the split between the Greek East and the Catholic West. After the Schism, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> under the Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. Some ethnologists consider that the distinct Serb and Croat identities relate to religion rather than ethnicity. With the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, some Serbs converted to Islam. This was particularly, but not wholly, the case in Bosnia. Since {{the second half of the}} 19th century, some Serbs converted to Protestantism, while historically some Serbs were Catholics (especially in Dalmatia; e.g. Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik). The remainder of Serbs remain predominantly Serbian Orthodox Christians.|$|E
