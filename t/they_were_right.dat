5|$|Johnston {{protested that}} the British {{government}} {{could not take}} part in the kind of judicial enquiry Smith described, as its sovereignty could not be subject to any outside judgement and there was nothing to arbitrate anyway. Smith was again resolute: why, he queried, was Whitehall so adamant to avoid legal arbitration if its ministers were so sure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right?</b> He promised to drop the matter if such a panel ruled against him, but to no avail. Johnston said only that he would telegraph Whitehall to inform them that Reedman's appointment was imminent. Dupont confirmed it that afternoon, telling the Rhodesian Legislative Assembly that the mission had been accepted by Portugal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E

The {{students}} may have believed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> in continuing their mass protest {{in response to the}} Cambodian invasion, even though this protest followed the posting and reading by the university of an order to ban rallies and an order to disperse.

40|$|Academic {{discussions of}} {{securities}} policy often assume that investors are hyperrational and distrustful actors {{who do not}} need the protections of the securities laws to avoid being defrauded. The {{time has come to}} recognize the limitations of this assumption and to consider as well the possibility and implications of investor trust. Experienced policymakers and businesspeople (and certainly experienced con artists) have long known that trust is a potent force in explaining and manipulating investor behavior. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> to believe that investor confidence-meaning investor trust-is important to the market. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> to think that trust has been imperiled by the recent slew of securities frauds and accounting scandals. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> to call for swift and sure action to restore investor trust...|$|R

25|$|Dickinson {{returned}} to the small screen in March 1974 for an episode of the critically acclaimed hit anthology series Police Story. The guest appearance proved to be so popular, NBC offered Dickinson her own television show, which became a ground-breaking weekly series called Police Woman; {{it was the first}} successful dramatic TV series to feature a woman in the title role. At first, Dickinson was reluctant, but when producers told her she could become a household name, she accepted the role. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a result, the {{remainder}} of his personal and political life had a distinct spiritual sheen. He emerged as a contemporary counterpart of Jose Rizal, who was among the most vocal proponents of the use of non-violence to combat a repressive regime at the time, following the model of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Some remained skeptical of Aquino's redirected spiritual focus and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right,</b> but it ultimately had an effect on his wife's political ambition. While some may question the prominence given Aquino in Philippine history, it was his assassination that was pivotal to the eventual restoration of constitutional democracy in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The Wings {{were quickly}} {{selected}} as favorites {{to win the}} Stanley Cup and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> With so much talent on one team, including the first time three 500-goal scorers {{were on the same}} team, they quickly got off to a great start, winning 22 of their first 27 games. After finishing with 116 points and {{the best record in the}} NHL (by 15 points), the Wings had earned the first seed in the Western Conference and met the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. After the Canucks took the first 2 games, it looked like the Canucks were going to sweep the Red Wings and the Red Wings were going to have their 2nd straight early exit. Their Captain, Steve Yzerman gave a closed-door speech to the team. Only the players in the locker room knew what was said, but the Wings headed to Vancouver and won four straight games to take the series.|$|E

Speaking about the relationship, Francis stated: [...] "I would like {{to continue to work}} with him because he is just so good, and Peter is so nice. I did do a couple scenes with him that I was really proud of, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> before the two of them make love for the first time.

There was talk among grandmasters that Fischer hypnotized his opponents, that he undermined their intellectual powers with a dark, mystic, insidious force.|$|E

Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them to make sure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> She explained, [...] "But what happens is {{as soon as you}} put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Express & Star, Elizabeth Joyce said {{although}} Lewis {{was not like}} her contemporaries: [...] "meat dress-wearing" [...] Lady Gaga or the Russell Brand-marrying Katy Perry, [...] "no one can reach those soft lows or soaring highs quite like her". Joyce praised the concert for showing the best of Lewis' vocal abilities. Focussing predominately on songs from Spirit (2007) and Glassheart (2012), the concert was largely acoustic music with a band and string quartet. In particular Joyce praised Lewis' performances of [...] "First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" [...] and [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] which earned her standing ovations, {{in addition to the}} [...] "note perfect" [...] rendition of [...] "Run". Katherine Hollisey-McLean for the Worthing Herald largely agreed, commenting that if anyone expected Lewis to be [...] "belting out song after song" [...] <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> Hollisey-McLean praised the decisions to switch the song arrangements, for example adding reggae beats to [...] "Better in Time" [...] and performing the acoustic version of [...] "Trouble". She ended by saying that Lewis' vocals were [...] "flawless" [...] and that her stage presence and confidence had vastly improved over the last seven years.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{issued a}} casting {{call for the}} main roles in the series, with both Keating and Billingsley making {{immediate}} impressions on the casting director and staff. Braga said that they knew <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> for those roles [...] "right off the bat". Keating had previously auditioned for a role on Voyager two years prior, but Berman wanted to keep him for a future main role, saying that when he auditioned for Reed that the actor [...] "nailed it", although there were discussions about the accent he should be using with Keating suggesting one from the North of England but the producers mistook it for Scottish. In the end, they chose to go with Keating's natural voice. He also praised the casting processes involving Trinneer, Park and Billingsley, calling the latter [...] "perfect" [...] {{in his role as}} Doctor Phlox. Park wasn't required to audition, but instead was hired on the basis of her performance in a scene she appeared in The WB series Popular alongside Anthony Montgomery – despite that the character was intended to be older until Park was cast. Montgomery had previously auditioned to play Tuvok's son in Voyager, and after being chosen for the part of Travis Mayweather, he elected to take the part instead of a role in a low budget movie he had been offered.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regards to}} casting, Yamazaki {{said that they}} had cast actors on [...] "the basis of whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> for the role, not their popularity".

Specifically, Yamazaki referred to Okada, saying that [...] "He was extremely close to our image of Miyabe". He further elaborated by saying that [...] "In the film the character knows martial arts, so Okada studied hard. He got so much into it that he became a shihan [...]". He praised Okada as a guy [...] "who's really thorough when he focuses on one thing." ...|$|E

[...] Most directly affected on the German side was the IX Reserve Corps, in which at this point Thaer was serving as Chief of Staff. [...] Although, {{to the extent that they}} failed to achieve their military objectives, the Battle of Arras was seen as a defeat for the British, Thaer's diaries show that he was confirmed in his critical view of German military leadership: [...] "Faced with the tanks, our infantry reacted with terror, and indeed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> since they were defenceless. [...] Infantry weapons made no impression. [...] Now a weapon is on its way that should cut through, but sadly the folks at high command seem to incomprehensibly to underestimate the danger from the tanks".|$|E

Grief supplies you with an enormous amount of energy. I needed to use that up." [...] In between, Dench finished work on Richard Eyre's film Iris (2001), in which she portrayed novelist Iris Murdoch. Dench shared her role with Kate Winslet, both actresses portraying Murdoch at different phases of her life. Each of them was nominated for an Academy Award the following year, earning Dench her fourth nomination within five years. In addition, she was awarded both an ALFS Award and the Best Leading Actress Award at the 55th British Academy Film Awards.|$|E
