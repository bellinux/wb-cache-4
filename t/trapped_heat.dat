25|$|Heat gain is {{the heat}} {{accumulated}} {{from the sun}} in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect {{in this case is}} the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector.

25|$|A {{solar oven}} is turned towards {{the sun and}} left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require {{more than an hour}} of {{constant}} supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.|$|E

25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|E

50|$|Hiwassee Dam's height {{required}} a large mass of concrete which engineers feared would <b>trap</b> <b>heat</b> during its setting, making the dam {{more vulnerable to}} cracks. To help heat escape, the dam's concrete sections were divided into blocks no more than 50 ft in length. The blocks' joints were formed with shear keys, and pipes were installed to allow future grouting should it become necessary. Several practices were employed to avoid <b>trapping</b> <b>heat</b> {{in the setting of}} the concrete, including the use of low-heat cement.|$|R

50|$|Although {{some were}} built {{as early as}} 1903, all the houses along Wirt Davis Avenue, {{originally}} called Officers' Row, were completed by 1904. The original cost per house was $1,309.90. The distinctive construction allowed cooling breezes to pass under the raised floor and through the wide, screened verandas, while the steep, metal roofs dissipated <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> and allowed a rapid run-off of the heavy rains.

5000|$|Grass clippings, from mowed lawns are {{sometimes}} collected and used elsewhere as mulch. Grass clippings are dense {{and tend to}} mat down, so are mixed with tree leaves or rough compost to provide aeration and to facilitate their decomposition without smelly putrefaction. Rotting fresh grass clippings can damage plants; their rotting often produces a damaging buildup of <b>trapped</b> <b>heat.</b> Grass clippings are often dried thoroughly before application, which mediates against rapid decomposition and excessive heat generation. Fresh green grass clippings are relatively high in nitrate content, and when used as a mulch, much of the nitrate is returned to the soil, conversely the routine removal of grass clippings from the lawn results in nitrogen deficiency for the lawn.|$|E
50|$|Studies of {{earthshine}} {{can be used}} to {{show how}} the Earth's cloud cover varies over time. Preliminary results show a 6.5% dip in cloud cover between 1985 and 1997 and a corresponding increase between 1997 and 2003. This has implications for climate research, especially with regards to global warming. All clouds contribute to an increased albedo, however some clouds have a net warming effect because they <b>trap</b> more <b>heat</b> than they reflect, while others have a net cooling effect because their increased albedo reflects more radiation than they <b>trap</b> <b>heat.</b> So while the Earth's albedo is measurably increasing, the uncertainty over the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>trapped</b> means the overall effect on global temperature remains unclear.|$|R

50|$|Vegetation in {{the central}} Appalachian Mountains east towards the Atlantic Ocean was {{dominated}} by spruce (Picea spp.) and tamarack (Larix laricina) boreal forests that later changed rapidly to temperate, more broad-leaf tree forest conditions {{at the end of}} the Younger Dryas period. Conversely, pollen and macrofossil evidence from near Lake Ontario indicates that cool, boreal forests persisted into the early Holocene. East of the Appalachians, in the Ohio River Valley and south to Florida rapid, no-analog vegetation responses seem to have been the result rapid climate changes, but the area remained generally cool, with hardwood forest dominating. During the Younger Dryas, the Southeastern United States was warmer and wetter than the region had been during the Pleistocene because of <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> from the Caribbean within the North Atlantic Gyre caused by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).|$|E

50|$|Plants {{growing in}} the alpine or subalpine regions face the {{challenge}} of obtaining and retaining water. One solution for obtaining water is the growth of an extensive root system. A small alpine forget-me-not may stand only inches above the ground, but its taproot can extend for a couple of feet below the soil surface. The long taproot is necessary because of both the limited precipitation in many alpine and arctic environments, mostly as snowfall, and because of the rapid drainage of a newly formed and shallow soil. Besides obtaining water, the plant must also retain moisture to survive in a dry and desiccating environment. The compact growth form of cushion plants reduces air flow over the surface of the epidermis, reducing the rate of water loss. Additionally, many cushion plants have small and fleshy leaves which reduce the surface area of the plant, which reduces transpiration and conserves water. In alpine environments well above the tree line, cold is a limiting factor for growth, by having tightly packed stems and foliage, cushion plants are able to convert and trap heat from sunlight, causing them to warm several degrees above the ambient air temperature. Many alpine cushion plants also have thick matted hairs that warm up and heat the air trapped in between the hairs when the sun shines. These hairs also act as a greenhouse by preventing the warmer air from rising away from the plant, and they also act as wind breaks, preventing the wind from blowing away the <b>trapped</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The IFR uses {{metal alloy}} fuel (uranium/plutonium/zirconium) {{which is a}} good {{conductor}} of heat, unlike the LWR's (and even some fast breeder reactors') uranium oxide which is a poor conductor of heat and reaches high temperatures at the center of fuel pellets. The IFR also has a smaller volume of fuel, since the fissile material is diluted with fertile material by a ratio of 5 or less, compared to about 30 for LWR fuel. The IFR core requires more heat removal per core volume during operation than the LWR core; but on the other hand, after a shutdown, there is far less <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> that is still diffusing out and needs to be removed. However, decay heat generation from short-lived fission products and actinides is comparable in both cases, starting at a high level and decreasing with time elapsed after shutdown. The high volume of liquid sodium primary coolant in the pool configuration is designed to absorb decay heat without reaching fuel melting temperature. The primary sodium pumps are designed with flywheels so they will coast down slowly (90 seconds) if power is removed. This coast-down further aids core cooling upon shutdown. If the primary cooling loop were to be somehow suddenly stopped, or if the control rods were suddenly removed, the metal fuel can melt as accidentally demonstrated in EBR-I, however the melting fuel is then extruded up the steel fuel cladding tubes and out of the active core region leading to permanent reactor shutdown and no further fission heat generation or fuel melting. With metal fuel, the cladding is not breached and no radioactivity is released even in extreme overpower transients.|$|E
40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry indoor air quality or Vehicle Indoor Air Quality (VIAQ) are caused by various substances emitted from interior materials inside a vehicle. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are an example of emitted substances from the interior materials which is harmful to the human body. As stated by previous researches, {{there is a strong}} correlation between the total VOCs emission and interior temperature. This occurs due to the solar radiation through the back window glasses, windscreen and side window glasses. This <b>trapped</b> <b>heat</b> can accelerate the melting process of trim materials such as hard plastic and rubber, thus causing the emission of total VOCs (TVOCs). Therefore, reducing the percentage of visible light transmittance (VLT) will help to reduce radiation process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of VLT level on TVOCs emission in the vehicle cabin under static condition (parked and unventilated) and operating condition (driving and air-conditioned). For static condition the result shows that the TVOCs concentration linearly decreases whenever the percentage of VLT level decreases. However, for operating condition the percentage of VLT have less significance after 50 minutes driving time. In conclusion, the VLT levels have a strong relationship to the TVOCs concentration despite after a long driving time...|$|E
