5|$|The film, {{independently}} {{produced and}} financed by Hitchcock, {{was shot at}} Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. Psycho was shot on a tight budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started {{in the morning and}} finished by sixp.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen's). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50mm lenses on 35mm cameras. <b>This</b> <b>trick</b> closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.|$|E
5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats <b>this</b> <b>trick,</b> and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. <b>This</b> <b>trick</b> saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E

25|$|A {{more general}} {{situation}} where <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> is possible is with Omega-groups (in the general sense allowing operators with multiple arity). But this cannot be done with, for example, monoids, so {{the study of}} congruence relations plays a more central role in monoid theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>trick</b> can be generalized: {{there are}} many maps where if the colors of some regions are {{selected}} beforehand, it becomes impossible to color the remaining regions without exceeding four colors. A casual verifier of the counterexample may not think to change the colors of these regions, so that the counterexample will appear as though it is valid.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of his}} career, Houdini was a {{headline}} act in vaudeville. For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville. One of Houdini's most notable non-escape stage illusions was performed at the New York Hippodrome, when he vanished a full-grown elephant from the stage. He had purchased <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> from the magician Charles Morritt. In 1923, Houdini became president of Martinka & Co., America's oldest magic company. The business is still in operation today.|$|E

50|$|Illusory {{contours}} and neon color spreading {{are often}} difficult to differentiate. Neon color spreading {{is characterized by the}} color being used to create the visual phenomena. <b>This</b> <b>tricks</b> the visual system into thinking that there is color where there is not. Illusory contours cause a similar fooling of the visual system into perceiving contours by causing effects where the contours should be. They are both fooling the visual system in similar ways, but are characterized differently.|$|R
25|$|Another {{widely used}} tactic {{was to make}} a false retreat and then {{suddenly}} attack the enemy— breaking the lines when in pursuit. <b>This</b> <b>trick</b> won many victories, most notably at the battle of Adrianople in 1205 against the Crusaders. Sometimes the Bulgarians left a strong cavalry force in reserve which attacked in the sublime moment and tipped the balance in Bulgarians' favour, for instance in the battle of Anchialus in 917. Ambush was another widely used and very successful strategy especially during the Cometopuli dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Then, Apple {{decided that}} most of its {{application}} software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called Claris. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, {{in the business of}} selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contained an Easter Egg: typing 'magic' into the message box would convert the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment. When <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> became nearly-universal they wrote a new viewer only version, the HyperCard Player which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the full version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using <b>this</b> <b>trick,</b> a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E

He walked into the trap set by Zhou Fang and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by Jia Kui.|$|R

After he unites the Pirate Guild under his command, Salamander's unquenched ambitions lead him to seek {{absolute}} control over the galaxy. Lord Salamander rarely appears in person, but demonstrates a powerful telekinetic ability when he does. He can also teleport, incinerate an enemy by will alone, and make his enemies think they see someone else. He uses <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> and his other powers to dispose of Doug, Pumpkin, and Bud. In the final episode, he is revealed as the spirit of Adolf Hitler, which was revived 3000 years after his defeat. Lord Salamander was voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata in the anime.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Welles met and befriended Spanish film {{producer}} Emiliano Piedra, {{who wanted to}} work with him. Piedra did not think a Shakespearian film was marketable enough and proposed that Welles make a version of Treasure Island instead. Welles agreed [...] to this on condition that he could simultaneously make Chimes at Midnight, and Piedra agreed not knowing that Welles had no intention of making Treasure Island. Although some B-roll footage of the Alicante departing from port was shot early in the production, no scenes from Treasure Island were ever shot or even scripted. Welles got away with <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> throughout pre-production by building sets {{that could be used in}} both films, such as Mistress Quickly's Boar's Head Tavern, which would double as the Admiral Benbow Inn. Welles also cast each actor in both films, casting himself as Long John Silver, Baxter as Dr. Livesey, Beckley as Israel Hands and Gielgud as Squire Trelawney. Ironically Welles would eventually play Long John Silver in the unrelated 1972 film version of Treasure Island.|$|E

To general {{satisfaction}} he allocates the minor bequests, {{but when it}} comes to the mule, the house and the mills, he orders that these be left to [...] "my devoted friend Gianni Schicchi". Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outburst of rage when the notary leaves is countered by a love duet from Lauretta and Rinuccio, [...] "Lauretta mia"; there is now no bar to their marriage, since Schicchi can provide a full dowry. Schicchi chases the relatives out of what is now his house, and when he returns stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth.

500|$|The {{source code}} for Quake III was not {{released}} until QuakeCon 2005, but {{copies of the}} fast inverse square root code appeared on Usenet and other forums as early as 2002 or 2003. Initial speculation pointed to John Carmack as the probable author of the code, but he demurred and suggested {{it was written by}} Terje Mathisen, an accomplished assembly programmer who had previously helped id Software with Quake optimization. [...] Mathisen had written an implementation of a similar bit of code in the late 1990s, but the original authors proved to be much further back in the history of 3D computer graphics with Gary Tarolli's implementation for the SGI Indigo as a possible earliest known use. Rys Sommefeldt concluded that the original algorithm was devised by Greg Walsh at Ardent Computer in consultation with Cleve Moler, the creator of MATLAB. Cleve Moler learned about <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> from code written by William Kahan and K.C. Ng at Berkeley around 1986 [...] Jim Blinn also demonstrated a simple approximation of the inverse square root in a 1997 column for IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the mapping out of sequences, the episode features a short sequence that was shot {{to look as if}} it had been filmed during the show's second season, although the scene itself was filmed in 2011. Novak explained that, in order to recreate the shot, great lengths had to be taken to ensure the authenticity of the footage. Series Department Head make-up artist [...] LaVerne Caracuzzi-Milazzo and Hair Department Head [...] Kim M. Ferry [...] "put great care and effort into recreating the characters' looks from earlier seasons"; Novak, for instance wore [...] "the same bright blue shirt that Ryan used to favor" [...] and fake sideburns were glued onto the actor's face to [...] "match the era". He also stated that the actors [...] "remembered those dynamics [...] and fell right back into them." [...] This is not the first nor the last time <b>this</b> <b>trick</b> has been utilized on the show. For instance, during the cold opening for the sixth season episode [...] "Shareholder Meeting" [...] featuring [...] "Recyclops", a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. Furthermore, the episode [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] from the ninth season featured a montage of Jim setting up a prank supposedly during the show's second season.|$|E
