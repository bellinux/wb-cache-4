5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E

The Philippines national futsal team represents men's international futsal, and the Philippines national beach soccer team in men's international beach soccer.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> age the sample {{would be if}} the / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust {{than that of the}} other species, and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus, and there may be a second, more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The Triple Gate (Tam Quan) is {{accessible}} by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use {{the left and}} right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent emptiness, impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism. On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located in a concrete lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths.|$|E
5|$|Every runic {{inscription}} {{is shown}} with its ID code {{that is used}} in scholarly literature {{to refer to the}} inscription, and it is only obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which the inscription is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If the inscription was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the page in the publication.|$|E
5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced <b>that</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E
