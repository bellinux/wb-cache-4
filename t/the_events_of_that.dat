5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. <b>The</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV.

ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

5|$|Development {{plans for}} Kingdom Hearts II began around the {{completion}} of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel.

The game was originally supposed to have been released after Kingdom Hearts. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed.
