40|$|AbstractSuperchilling is {{a concept}} where the {{temperature}} is reduced 1 - 2 °C below the initial freezing point of the product. This results in a so-called ‘shell freezing’, where {{a thin layer of}} ice is produced on the product surface during processing. The small amount of ice formed within the product serves as a heat sink, eliminating the need for ice during storage and transport. As an illustration, chilled haddock fillets have approximately 30 % higher environmental impact potential than superchilled fillets due to the need for ice during storage and transport. During storage, the ice distribution equalizes and the product obtains a uniform temperature and the product appears as fresh. Consumer market analysis gives superchilled products as good as or better quality score compared with <b>chilled</b> <b>products.</b> xperiments on different superchilled and <b>chilled</b> food <b>products</b> shows a prolonged shelf life for all superchilled <b>products</b> compared to <b>chilled</b> <b>products.</b> For superchilled salmon and chicken fillets, the shelf life is 50 % longer compared to <b>chilled</b> reference <b>products</b> based on total count of microorganism and a quality limit of 107 CFU/g. Superchilled experiments have shown that the method is robust and appropriate for implementation to the industry, owing to the fact that ice fractions can very between 5 - 20 % without being of major importance to the product quality. Superchilling enable safe, high quality and long term storage of foods. The main advantage is the approximate doubling of shelf life for superchilled <b>products</b> compared to <b>chilled</b> <b>products,</b> high product quality, higher yield and the potential for reduced environmental impacts (approximately 30 %) when changing from chilled to superchilled value chains...|$|R

40|$|Freeze-chilling {{involves}} {{freezing and}} frozen storage followed by thawing and chilled storage. A number of ready-to-eat meal components {{have been studied}} for their suitability for freeze chilling including, potatoes, carrots, green beans, broccoli, salmon and white sauces. In general, sensory analysis showed that freeze-chilled products were similar in quality to their chilled or frozen counterparts. There were some differences between the freeze-chilled and <b>chilled</b> <b>products</b> in instrumental texture assessment and centrifugal drip loss due to cell damage arising from the freezing step. A freezing rate study was carried out to determine if more rapid freezing could improve texture and drip. Mashed potato was frozen at - 30, - 60 or - 90 °C to an internal temperature of - 25 °C, stored at - 25 °C for 4 days and then stored at chill temperature (4 °C) for a further 4 days. No difference was found in sensory acceptability between any of the treatments. Drip loss was tower (P< 0. 001) in the chilled mashed potato and decreased with decreasing freezing temperature in the freeze-chilled mashed potato. Freeze-chilling led to a finer texture (P< 0. 001) than chilling alone but the texture softened (P< 0. 01) with decreasing freezing temperature. Freeze-chilled foods are potentially more at risk to temperature abuse than <b>chilled</b> <b>products</b> due to the increased amounts of drip water arising from the freezing/thawing steps. A trial was carried out {{on the effects of}} different storage temperatures on the quality and safety of freeze-chilled mashed potato. No difference in microbial levels was detected between chill and freeze-chill at any storage temperature but storage time and temperature had effects on total viable counts in both <b>chilled</b> and freeze-chilled <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{is applied}} widely in food cold chain logistics. However, {{traditional}} monitoring systems require significant real-time sensor data transmission which {{will result in}} heavy data traffic and communication systems overloading, and thus reduce the data collection and transmission efficiency. This research aims to develop a temperature Monitoring System for Frozen and <b>Chilled</b> Aquatic <b>Products</b> (MS-FCAP) based on WSN integrated with Compressed Sending (CS) to improve the efficiency of MS-FCAP. Through understanding the temperature and related information requirements of frozen and <b>chilled</b> aquatic <b>products</b> cold chain logistics, this paper illustrates {{the design of the}} CS model which consists of sparse sampling and data reconstruction, and shelf-life prediction. The system was implemented and evaluated in cold chain logistics between Hainan and Beijing in China. The evaluation result suggests that MS-FCAP has a high accuracy in reconstructing temperature data under variable temperature condition as well as under constant temperature condition. The result shows that MS-FCAP is capable of recovering the sampled sensor data accurately and efficiently, reflecting the real-time temperature change in the refrigerated truck during cold chain logistics, and providing effective decision support traceability for quality and safety assurance of frozen and <b>chilled</b> aquatic <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|Time is an {{important}} factor in terms of seafood pro-duction costs. In general, the faster a product can be brought to market, the lower the production costs. Products that lose quality with time, such as <b>chilled</b> <b>products,</b> obviously have important con-straints, especially the time between the points of capture and consumption. The importance of time with regard to live products is somewhat different. On the one hand, live product can be held for rela-tively long periods without any deterioration in product quality. On the other hand, organisms tend to die over time, so the size of a given live harvest will tend to decay over time. Examined here are some of the relationships between live product holding times and productio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{prescriptive}} {{approach is}} primarily {{used to establish}} energy benchmarks for energy systems in buildings. This paper reviews national standards and guidelines for the energy performance of chiller systems which provide cooling energy in commercial buildings but their operation causes the major proportion of electricity consumption in the building sector. The standards reviewed are currently adopted in nine places (in alphabetical order) : Australia, California, Canada, China, Chinese Taipei, the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the USA. Under standard rating conditions at full load operation, the minimum required coefficient of performance (COP) ranges from 2. 40 to 3. 06 for air-cooled chillers and from 3. 80 to 6. 39 for water-cooled chillers. Some standards state also the COP requirements at part load operation with integrated part load values or seasonal energy efficiency ratios.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{published}} {{data on the}} performance and use of domestic refrigerators throughout {{the world in the}} last 30 years. While there is considerable legislation defining maximum temperatures during the production, distribution and retailing of chilled food, as soon as the consumer purchases the food, it is outside of any of these legislative requirements. Inadequate domestic refrigeration or cooling is frequently cited as a possible factor in food poisoning incidents. It is clear from the many published surveys that many refrigerators throughout the world are running at higher than recommended temperatures. Since even these recommended temperatures are higher than the 0 to 1 °C that is usually the recommended temperature range for storing fish and seafood, meat and many <b>chilled</b> <b>products</b> the current situation is even more detrimental to maintaining the high quality life of chilled foods. Despite numerous surveys around the world, how refrigerator temperatures and cleanliness impacts on consumer health remains to be fully assessed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Seafood is an {{important}} food source for many. Consumers should be entitled to an informed choice, and there is growing concern about correct composition labeling of seafood. Due to its high price, {{it has been shown}} to be vulnerable to adulteration. In the present study, we focus on moisture levels in seafood. Moisture and crude protein contents of chilled and frozen cod, pangasius, salmon, shrimp and tilapia purchased from various retail outlets in the Netherlands were examined by reference methods and the values of which were compared with the reported data from other studies in literature. Significant differences in proximate composition were determined for different species and between <b>chilled</b> and frozen <b>products</b> of the same species. Pangasius products showed the highest moisture contents in general (86. 3 g/ 100 g), and shrimp products revealed the largest differences between <b>chilled</b> and frozen <b>products.</b> Comparison with literature values and good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards exposed that, generally, chilled pangasius, frozen pangasius and frozen shrimp products presented considerably higher moisture and lower crude protein/nitrogen contents than those found in other studies.

40|$|With {{many aspects}} that affect {{inventory}} policy, product perishability {{is a critical}} aspect of inventory policy. Most goods will deteriorate during storage and their original value will decline or be lost. Therefore, deterioration {{should be taken into}} account in inventory practice. <b>Chilled</b> food <b>products</b> are very common consumer goods that are, in fact, perishable. If the chilled food quality declines over time customers are less likely to buy it. The value the chilled food retains is, however, closely dependent on its quality.

40|$|Where water {{shortage}} is concerned, air-cooled chillers are typically installed to provide cooling energy in commercial buildings with significant electricity consumption. This study investigates performance data and technical specifications {{on a wide}} range of air-cooled <b>chiller</b> <b>products.</b> The coefficient of performance (COP) of the chillers at full load operation ranges from 2. 4 to 3. 7, with 2. 9, 3. 1 and 3. 3 in the 25 th, 50 th and 75 th percentiles, respectively. A survey on national standards and guidelines for the energy performance of air-cooled chillers shows that the minimum required COPs lie between 2. 4 - 3. 1 at full load operation. This suggests that over 50 % of the existing products can meet the requirement and more stringent control should be in place to boost the use of high efficiency chillers. Control algorithms should be further exploited to judge if the chillers operate with desirable performance under part load conditions. Advanced controls are seldom applied to optimize their performance at part load operation. Department of Building Services EngineeringHong Kong Community Colleg...|$|R
