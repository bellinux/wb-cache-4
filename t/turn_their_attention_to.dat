5|$|Władysław's last {{plan was}} to orchestrate a major war between the European powers and the Ottoman Empire. The border with the Empire was in a near {{constant}} state of low-level warfare; some historians estimate {{that in the first}} half of the 17th century, Ottoman raids and wars resulted in the loss (death or enslavement) of about 300,000 Commonwealth citizens in the borderlands. The war, Władysław hoped, would also solve the problem of unrest among the Cossacks, a militant group living in the Ukraine, near the Ottoman border, who could find worth in such a campaign, and <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> fighting for the Commonwealth, instead of against it. As usual, he failed to inspire the nobility, rarely willing to consider sponsoring another war, to agree to this plan. He received more support from foreign powers, from Rome, Venice and Muscovy. With the promise of funds for the war, Władysław started recruiting troops among the Cossacks in 1646. The opposition of the Sejm, demanding that he dismiss the troops, coupled with Władysław's worsening health, crippled that plan as well. Władysław still did not give up, and attempted to resurrect the plan in 1647, and with support of magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (who organized military exercises near Ottoman border), attempted unsuccessfully to provoke the Ottomans to attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat at}} Fort Bowyer led the British to <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{an attack on}} New Orleans. In the run-up to battle, Captain Nicholas Lockyer {{captured}} an American flotilla, consisting primarily of five gunboats, in the Battle of Lake Borgne. Anaconda did not contribute her boats and crew to the battle, but evacuated the 77 {{men who had been}} wounded there.|$|E

25|$|Forestry is an {{important}} economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, {{are some of the}} obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} period, {{a sense of}} {{national}} awakening began to develop among the Ruthenians {{in the eastern part}} of Galicia. A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by Markiian Shashkevych, published The Nymph of the Dniester, a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.|$|E
25|$|When {{decision-makers}} {{have determined}} the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. The tactical approach to pricing may vary {{from time to}} time, depending {{on a range of}} internal considerations (e.g. the need to clear surplus inventory) or external factors (e.g. a response to competitive pricing tactics). Accordingly, a number of different pricing tactics may be employed {{in the course of a}} single planning period or across a single year. Typically store managers have the necessary latitude to vary prices on individual lines provided that they operate within the parameters of the overall strategic approach.|$|E

25|$|Medici {{attempted}} {{to promote the}} candidacy of others in his party, but none could gain wide support. Wolsey received eight votes, but his young age deterred other cardinals from supporting him (the English ambassador tried to convince the College he was over fifty). Medici addressed the conclave on January 9 and suggested they <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> candidates not present in the conclave, expressing his willingness to elect Adrian of Utrecht. In the following scrutiny Adrian received fifteen votes, including all those controlled by Medici. Colonna, the main opponent of Medici and those in his party then declared his support for Adrian, netting him thirteen more votes by accessus, exactly two-thirds. As Adrian was not present, his candidacy did not require two-thirds plus one.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{years went}} by before Raleigh {{decided to find out}} what {{happened}} to his colony. Led by Samuel Mace, this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering. However, Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip, and Mace's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England. By the time they could <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the colonists, the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island. By this time, having been arrested for treason, Raleigh was unable to send any further missions.|$|E
25|$|Chronic iron {{toxicity}} {{is usually}} the result of more chronic iron overload syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes. In such cases the iron stores of an adult may reach 50grams (10 times normal total body iron) or more. Classic examples of genetic iron overload includes hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and the more severe disease juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) caused by mutations in either the gene RGMc gene, {{a member of a}} three gene repulsive guidance molecule family, (also called hemojuvelin (HJV), and HFE2), Hemojuvelin, or the HAMP gene that encodes (an iron regulatory peptide). The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic iron overload disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the normal function of these mutated genes.|$|E

500|$|The British War Cabinet had cautioned Allenby not {{to commit}} to any {{operations}} {{that might not be}} sustainable in the long term if the strength of British forces in the area could not be maintained. Their concerns were possibly linked to a peace proposal published on 8 November by the new Russian Bolshevik government between Russia and Germany. The document, scheduled to be signed on 3 March 1918, would constitute a separate peace treaty and result in the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the war. All German forces on the eastern front [...] could then <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> fighting British and French forces elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} {{a prolonged}} war in Hungary with the Habsburgs in 1568, the Ottomans {{were free to}} <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Cyprus. Sultan Selim II had made the conquest of the island his first priority already before his accession in 1566, relegating Ottoman aid to the Morisco Revolt against Spain and attacks against Portuguese activities in the Indian Ocean to a secondary priority. Not surprisingly for a ruler nicknamed [...] "the Sot", popular legend ascribed this determination to his love of Cypriot wines, but the major political instigator of the conflict, according to contemporary reports, was Joseph Nasi, a Portuguese Jew who had become the Sultan's close friend, and who had already been named to the post of Duke of Naxos upon Selim's accession. Nasi harboured resentment towards Venice and hoped for his own nomination as King of Cyprus after its conquest—he already had a crown and a royal banner made to that effect.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1752, the Journals {{circulation}} was dropping steadily and it was losing popularity. After making the transition to weekly publication on 4 July, it was advertised less, and, in the final months of 1752, its discussion of anything other than court decisions and political actions was minimal. In addition, Fielding's health was deteriorating and his inclination to continue the periodical had declined. The 72nd and final number of The Covent-Garden Journal was published on 25 November 1752; Fielding there confirmed his lack of interest: [...] "I shall here lay down a paper which I have neither inclination nor leisure to carry on any longer." [...] He also directed readers to <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> The Public Advertiser, a new periodical to be released on 1 December and to replace The Daily Advertiser.

2500|$|Upon its {{invention}} by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar, it {{was clear}} that the euphonium, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, had a wide range and a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range. [...] It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, earning it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voiced solo instrument in brass band settings, especially in Britain. [...] When British composers who had written for brass bands began to <b>turn</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the concert band in the early twentieth century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role. [...] Gustav Holst, for example, wrote very important solos for the euphonium in his first (1909) and second (1911) suites for band, and similar lyrical solos appear in many pieces from the 1920s and '30s by Percy Grainger and Ralph Vaughan Williams.|$|E
