5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} experimentally (<b>Table</b> <b>7).</b> This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy {{such as the}} dalton, the electron mass, the electron volt, the astronomical unit, the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
500|$|To further {{complicate the}} practice, the ascent rate may {{vary with the}} depth, and is {{typically}} faster at greater depth and reduces as the depth gets shallower. In practice a continuous decompression profile may be approximated by ascent in steps as small as the chamber pressure gauge will resolve, and timed to follow the theoretical profile as closely as conveniently practicable. [...] For example, USN treatment <b>table</b> <b>7</b> (which may be used if decompression sickness has reoccurred during initial treatment in the compression chamber) states [...] "Decompress with stops every 2 feet for times shown in profile below." [...] The profile shows an ascent rate of 2fsw every 40min from 60fsw (feet of sea water) to 40fsw, followed by 2ft every hour from 40fsw to 20fsw and 2ft every two hours from 20fsw to 4fsw.|$|E
