25|$|French {{demands from}} the Duke were {{nothing less than}} an attack on Savoyard independence, and the {{intimidation}} ultimately proved counter-productive. In the early summer of 1690 Amadeus realised he had {{to stand up to}} France and he began to look towards the Grand Alliance. But he had conditions. Amadeus reiterated his family claim to the Duchy of Montferrat, over which the House of Savoy was in perennial dispute with the Duke of Mantua, stipulating the razing of Casale as the minimum he would accept in this region; he also demanded the reacquisition of Pinerolo as <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of Savoyard entry into the war on the Allied side, and sought to take over at least one French place in Dauphiné. Amadeus's hectic preparations for war and his negotiations for financial assistance from England and Spain, were followed by a declaration of war against France on 4 June.|$|E

In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others. Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered [...] "I'm In Love With a Girl" [...] on their 2015 release All a Man Should Do, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.|$|E

Although most of the work produced by Peckitt was painted glass he did experiment with stained glass and produced windows incorporating it, unlike his contemporaries. He “realised that colour is <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of Stained Glass”.

Although his contributions to the technical development of the craft have been well recognised and documented his draughtsmanship has sometimes been criticised;” his work has little merit in either design or colour”. He attempted to resolve this by employing established draughtsmen such as the Italians Biagio Rebecca and Giovanni Battista Cipriani to draw cartoons for him.|$|E
2500|$|Though Spener {{has been}} called the [...] "father of Pietism," [...] Albrecht Ritschl (Geschichte des Pietismus, ii. 163) {{maintains}} that [...] "he was himself not a Pietist," [...] as he did not advocate the quietistic, legalistic and semi-separatist practices of Pietism, though they were more or less involved in the positions he assumed or the practices which he encouraged or connived at. The only two points on which he departed from the orthodox Lutheran faith of his day were the requirement of regeneration as <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of the true theologian, and the expectation of the conversion of the Jews and the fall of Papacy as the prelude of the triumph of the church. He did not, like the later Pietists, insist on the necessity of a conscious crisis of conversion, nor did he encourage a complete breach between the Christian and the secular life.

If the task of world-historical politics of the profane order is none other than happiness itself, this happiness is never <b>the</b> conditio <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non,</b> since it is based upon the relative conditions of the historical order which is marked by transiency and insufficiency. Taking Kierkegaard and Plato as our main reference points, this article argues that the singular notion of beatitudes is irreducible to any theodicy of history, and that the arrival of beatitudes demands an eschatological opening of history to <b>the</b> true conditio <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non.</b> Beatitudes can only be a gift that marks everything human with an irreducible finitude of being. Nothing of the world-historical politics raises to the arrival of true beatitudes, but only as an eschatological suspension of its law, and abandonment, in the sense that Meister Eckhart speaks of Gelazenheit...|$|R

2500|$|The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist Vincenzo Galilei (ca. 1520–1591), {{father of}} Galileo and the {{inventor}} of monody, made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his Dialogo della musica antica e moderna (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for [...] "experiment" [...] was esperienza. It is known {{that he was the}} essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei), arguably {{one of the most influential}} empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of 'Pythagoras' hammers' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded [...] "experience and demonstration" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of valid rational enquiry.|$|E
2500|$|Landy {{distinguishes between}} the [...] "commercial wing" [...] and [...] "the {{academic}} wing" [...] of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI {{as seen by}} the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that [...] "the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have {{a high degree of}} {{what has come to be}} known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions [...] "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." [...] Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in [...] "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification. Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Kovel {{notes that}} [...] "events in nature are {{reciprocal}} and multi-determined" [...] and can therefore not be predictably [...] "fixed"; socially, technologies cannot solve social problems {{because they are}} not [...] "mechanical". He posits an analysis, developed from Marx, that patterns of production and social organisation are more important then the forms of technology used within a given configuration of society. Under capitalism, he suggests that technology [...] "has been <b>the</b> <b>sine</b> <b>qua</b> <b>non</b> of growth" [...] – thus he believes that, even in a world with hypothetical [...] "free energy", the effect would be to lower the cost of automobile production, leading to the massive overproduction of vehicles, [...] "collapsing infrastructure", chronic resource depletion and the [...] "paving over" [...] of the [...] "remainder of nature". In the modern world, Kovel considers the supposed efficiency of new post-industrial commodities is a [...] "plain illusion", as miniaturized components involve many substances and are therefore non-recyclable (and, theoretically, only simple substances could be retrieved by burning out-of-date equipment, releasing more pollutants). He is quick to warn [...] "environmental liberals" [...] against over-selling the virtues of renewable energies that cannot meet the mass energy consumption of the era; although he would still support renewable energy projects, he believes {{it is more important to}} restructure societies to reduce energy use before relying on renewable energy technologies alone.|$|E
