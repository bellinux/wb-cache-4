Furthermore, benchmarks reveal that the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> its predecessor.

About 33% thinner {{than its predecessor}} and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, {{as well as a}} three-axis gyroscope.

Freight traffic {{increased}} about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> passenger traffic, and in 1904 a new daily train was put into service to Storlien. The first Hell–Sunnan Line opened in stages between 1902 and 1905.

5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct memory access (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E

Cold fronts can move up to <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms.

40|$|International audienceHierarchical Enumerative Coding (HENUC) is a {{lossless}} compression algorithm {{used in a}} wavelet based image encoder. By manipulating the wavelet coefficients into locally stationary sequences, HENUC is demonstrated to provide good compression efficiency according to our experimental results. We extended our previous work on FPGA encoder SoC, exploiting an innovative on-chip memory access manner in the bit-plane coding using dual port, {{as well as an}} address-based data traversal technique during the coding. Performance results are based on the Altera's 40 nm Stratix IV EP 4 SGX 230 FPGA, on a DE 4 board from Terasic, where the optimized dual port HENUC architecture is implemented in a Nios II processor based system on chip. We present the resource utilization and the execution time evaluations. We show that our implementation at 100 MHz can provide around 10 X speedup over 2. 4 GHz Intel Xeon 8 -core CPU, which is about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> our previous result...|$|R

5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E

Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E

5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.

5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While {{it took four}} years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, {{it took more than}} around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016.

5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts.

The Locksmith can open doors <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies {{who are not in}} the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
