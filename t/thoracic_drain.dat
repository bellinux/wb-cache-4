We describe {{the case of a}} 21 -year-old female with spontaneous pneumothorax in a single lung, which posed several diagnostic and therapeutic problems. The presence of a “buffalo chest” made the initial chest x-ray interpretation difficult. The patient had an important air leak without complete pulmonary expansion and thoracic surgery was considered of risk. Accordingly, instillation of talc slurry through one of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>drains</b> was undertaken with eventual resolution.

The pneumothorax occurred on day one after a surgical operation for discal hernia; {{in the past the}} patient already presented a right spontaneous pneumothorax at 32 years of age and a left pneumothorax at 37 years of age, both treated with a pleural drainage. A <b>thoracic</b> <b>drain</b> was bilaterally positioned with a good result only in the right side. The persistence of the left pneumothorax induced the authors to perform a postero-lateral thoracotomy bullae excision and pleurectomy with a good postoperative course.

On the basis of the case reported, the authors consider the different opportunities in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax in relation to the present knowledges and technologies. Surgical procedure is to be preferred in case of persistence of pneumothorax despite a pleural drain and in case of pneumothorax in high risk subjects. Even if thoracoscopy seems to give better results regarding postoperative pain, it is not always possible with such a method to perform a careful pleurectomy neither to obtain it in all cases (above all in secondary pneumothorax).

40|$|AIM: To {{present a}} new {{technique}} of cervical esophagogastric anastomosis to reduce the frequency of fistula formation. METHODS: A group of 31 patients with thoracic and abdominal esophageal cancer underwent cervical esophagogastric anastomosis with invagination of the proximal esophageal stump into the stomach tube. In the region elected for anastomosis, a transverse myotomy of the esophagus was carried out around the entire circumference of the esophagus. Afterwards, a 4 -cm long segment of esophagus was invaginated into the stomach and anastomosed to the anterior and the posterior walls. RESULTS: Postoperative minor complications occurred in 22 (70. 9 %) patients. Four (12. 9 %) patients had serious complications that led to death. The discharge of saliva was at a lower region, while attempting to leave the anastomosis site out of the alimentary transit. Three (9. 7 %) patients had fistula at the esophagogastric anastomosis, with minimal leakage of air or saliva and with mild clinical repercussions.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPrevious studies {{revealed}} that {{surgical lung biopsy}} in usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) patients is accompanied with higher morbidity and mortality. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess morbidity and mortality of patients with suspected UIP undergoing surgical lung biopsy. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of 45 patients with suspected UIP pattern undergoing surgical biopsy for diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in our department. Data concerning medical history, histology, and survival status were extracted from the medical database of the University Medical Center Freiburg. ResultsUIP was diagnosed by experienced pneumo-pathologists according to the criteria of American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) consensus classification. Due to adhesions the surgeon decided in two patients to perform wedge resection via open surgery. In 43 patients lung biopsy was performed via Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). No intraoperative complications were observed. Postoperative complications consisted of bradyarrhythmia (n =  1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n =  1), bacterial pneumonia (n =  1), candida pneumonia (n =  1) and acute exacerbation (n =  1). There was no 30 -day mortality, but one patient was lost in follow-up and therefore censored.

30|$|The {{abdominal}} cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision. The liver {{was found to}} swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward. Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction. After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the {{abdominal cavity}}. Although {{there was no significant}} change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a <b>thoracic</b> <b>drain</b> was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated. However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct. Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose. Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision. There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura. Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation. Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and practice seems to vary between centres. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to survey current practice in Scandinavia. Thirteen paediatric surgical centres serving a population of about 22 million were invited, and all participated. One questionnaire was completed at each centre. The questionnaire evaluated management following prenatal diagnosis, intensive care strategies, operative treatment, and long-term follow-up. Survival data (1995 - 1998) were available from 12 of 13 centres. Following prenatal diagnosis of CDH, vaginal delivery and maternal steroids were used at eight and six centres, respectively. All centres used high-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV), nitric oxide (NO), and surfactant comparatively often. Five centres had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) facilities, and four centres transferred ECMO candidates. The majority of centres (7 / 9) always tried HFOV before ECMO was instituted. Surgery was performed when the neonate was clinically stable (11 / 13) and when no signs of pulmonary hypertension were detected by echo-Doppler (6 / 13).

40|$|Abstract Background Ureteral injury {{occurs in}} less than 1 % of blunt {{abdominal}} trauma cases, partly because the ureters are relatively well protected in the retroperitoneum. Bilateral ureteral injury is extremely rare, with only 10 previously reported cases. Diagnosis may be delayed if ureteric injury is not suspected, and delay of 36 hours or longer has been observed in more than 50 % of patients with ureteric injury following abdominal trauma, leading to increased morbidity. Case presentation A 29 -year-old man {{was involved in a}} highway motor vehicle collision and was ejected from the front passenger seat even though wearing a seatbelt. He was in a preshock state {{at the scene of the}} accident. An intravenous line and left <b>thoracic</b> <b>drain</b> were inserted, and he was transported to our hospital by helicopter. Whole-body, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed left diaphragmatic disruption, splenic injury, and a grade I injury to the left kidney with a retroperitoneal haematoma. He underwent emergency laparotomy. The left diaphragmatic and splenic injuries were repaired. Although a retroperitoneal haematoma was observed, his renal injury was treated conservatively because the haematoma was not expanding. In the intensive care unit, the patient's haemodynamic state was stable, but there was no urinary output for 9 hours after surgery. Anuresis prompted a review of the abdominal x-ray which had been performed after the contrast-enhanced CT. Leakage of contrast material from the ureteropelvic junctions was detected, and review of the repeat CT scan revealed contrast retention in the perirenal retroperitoneum bilaterally. He underwent cystoscopy and bilateral retrograde pyelography, which showed bilateral complete ureteral disruption, preventing placement of ureteral stents. Diagnostic laparotomy revealed complete disruption of the ureteropelvic junctions bilaterally. Double-J ureteral stents were placed bilaterally and ureteropelvic anastomoses were performed. The patient's postoperative progress was satisfactory and he was discharged on the 23 rd day. Conclusion Diagnosis of ureteral injury was delayed, although delayed phase contrast-enhanced CT and abdominal x-rays performed after CT revealed the diagnosis early. Prompt detection and early repair prevented permanent renal damage and the necessity for nephrectomy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objetivos: A válvula de Heimlich foi descrita para substituir os sistemas de drenagem sob selo d'água. O Serviço de Cirurgia Torácica do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo realizou este estudo com o objetivo de avaliar sua eficiência no tratamento do pneumotórax, bem como a facilidade de manipulação, segurança e tolerância pelo paciente. Métodos: Foram analisados 108 pacientes com pneumotórax de diferentes etiologias, de junho/ 97 a agosto/ 2000. A maioria (76 %) apresentava pneumotórax classificado radiologicamente como médio ou grande, sendo três deles hipertensivos, dos quais um bilateral. Utilizaram-se para a drenagem da cavidade pleural cateteres plásticos de teflon ou poliuretano tipo {{pig-tail}} 10, 2 F, 14 F ou retos 11 F conectados à válvula de Heimlich. Nos pacientes pós-toracotomias, a válvula foi conectada diretamente ao dreno torácico. Resultados: O período de permanência da válvula variou de um a 120 dias (mediana de quatro dias). A tolerância ao sistema foi considerada boa por 89 % dos pacientes. Não ocorreram complicações atribuíveis ao sistema. A presença de derrame associado em 20 pacientes (18, 5 %) não impediu o bom funcionamento do sistema. Apenas dois (1, 8 %) pacientes evoluíram com enfisema subcutâneo progressivo, optando-se então por dreno tubular 36 F sob selo d'água. Em um paciente (0, 9 %) indicou-se toracotomia para descorticação pulmonar. Vinte pacientes (18, 5 %) foram tratados no ambulatório. Conclusões: A válvula de Heimlich mostrou-se eficiente na resolução do pneumotórax de diferentes etiologias e nas fístulas aéreas pós-operatórias. A manipulação foi mais simples do que as historicamente observadas nos sistemas convencionais. A boa tolerância e segurança referidas pelos pacientes foram fator determinante na precocidade da alta hospitalar e incentivo ao tratamento ambulatorial.

The objective of this study by the Thoracic Surgery Service of the "Hospital das Clínicas", University of São Paulo Medical Center, is to assess its effectiveness in the treatment of pneumothorax and its ease of operation, safety, and patient toleration. Methods: From June/ 97 to August/ 00, 107 patients with pneumotoraxes of different etiologies were analyzed. The majority (76 %) were classified radiologically as suffering from moderate or large pneumothorax, three hypertensive pneumothorax, and one was bilateral. The pleural cavity was drained with teflon or polyurethane plastic pig-tail catheters (10. 2 F, 14 F, straight 11 F connected to the Heimlich valve or the valve was connected directly to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>drain</b> in post-thoracotomy patients). Results: The valve remained in place for one to 120 days (mean 4 days). Tolerance to the system was good in 89 % of cases. There were no serious complication linked to the system. Associated pleural effusion in 20 patients (18. 5 %) did not prevent the system from functioning well. Only two patients (1. 8 %) developed subcutaneous emphysema, and therefore, a 36 F Tubular drain under water seal was chosen. Thoracotomy for decortication was indicated in one patient (0. 9 %). Twenty patients (18. 5 %) were treated on an outpatient basis. Conclusions: The Heimlich valve confirmed its effectiveness in resolving pneumothorax of different etiologies and in postoperative air leaks.

40|$|Noninvasive {{mechanical}} ventilation during the postoperative period (PO) following lung resection can restore residual functional capacity, improve oxygenation and spare the inspiratory muscles. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) associated with physiotherapy, compared with physiotherapy alone after lung resection. Open randomized clinical trial conducted in the clinical hospital of Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Sessions were held in the immediate postoperative period (POi) and on the first and second postoperative days (PO 1 and PO 2), and the patients were reassessed on the discharge day. CPAP was applied for two hours and the pressure adjustment was set between 7 and 8. 5 cmH 2 O. The oxygenation index (OI), Borg scale, pain scale and presence of <b>thoracic</b> <b>drains</b> and air losses were evaluated. There was a significant increase in the OI in the CPAP group in the POi compared to the Chest Physiotherapy (CP) group, P = 0. 024. In the CP group the OI was significantly lower on PO 1 (P = 0, 042), than CPAP group. The air losses were significantly greater in the CPAP group in the POi and on PO 1 (P = 0. 001, P = 0. 028), but there was no significant difference between the groups on PO 2 and PO 3. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups regarding the Borg scale in the POi (P < 0. 001), but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the pain score. CPAP after lung resection is safe and improves oxygenation, without increasing the air losses through the drains. NCT 01285648...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{ascertain}} current {{chest radiography}} practice {{in intensive care}} units (ICUs) in the Netherlands. METHODS: Postal survey: a questionnaire was sent to all ICUs with > 5 beds suitable for mechanical ventilation; pediatric ICUs were excluded. When an ICU performed daily-routine chest radiographs in any group of patients it {{was considered to be}} a "daily-routine chest radiography" ICU. RESULTS: From the number of ICUs responding, 63 % practice a daily-routine strategy, in which chest radiographs are obtained on a daily basis without any specific reason. A daily-routine chest radiography strategy is practiced less frequently in university-affiliated ICUs (50 %) as compared to other ICUs (68 %), as well as in larger ICUs (> 20 beds, 50 %) as compared to smaller ICUs (0. 05). Remarkably, physicians that practice a daily-routine strategy consider daily-routine radiographs helpful in guiding daily practice in less than 30 % of all performed radiographs. Chest radiographs are considered essential for verification of the position of invasive devices (81 %) and for diagnosing pneumothorax, pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (82 %, 74 % and 69 %, respectively). On demand chest radiographs are obtained after introduction of <b>thoracic</b> <b>drains,</b> central venous lines and endotracheal tubes in 98 %, 84 % and 75 % of responding ICUs, respectively. Chest films are also obtained in case of ventilatory deterioration (49 % of responding ICUs), and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (59 %), tracheotomy (58 %) and mini-tracheotomy (23 %). CONCLUSION: There is notable lack of consensus on chest radiography practice in the Netherlands.

40|$|Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{features}} of allergic airways disease. HowAHR is limited in the face of continued allergen exposure in asthmatic individuals remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the role of airway CD 4 + T cells and Dendritic Cells (DC) in initiation and subsequent attenuation of AHR. BALB/c mice were sensitized with intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) in Aluminium Hydroxide and challenged with a single or 3 -weeks of OVA aerosol. One OVA aerosol induced AHR to methacholine (MCh), as measured by low-frequency forced oscillation technique, whilst multiple challenges resulted in attenuation of MCh responses. Similar proportions of CD 4 + T cells became activated following both aerosol regimes, however total numbers of airway CD 4 + T cells were significantly decreased, and OVA-specific CD 4 + T cell proliferation in draining lymph nodes was significantly reduced after multiple versus one OVA aerosol. Analysis of antigen handling by airwayAntigen Presenting Cell populations showed antigen uptake (OVA- 647) and processing (DQ-OVA) by macrophages and airway DC subsets to be down-regulated after 3 -weeks of OVA aerosols. Furthermore, multiple challenges resulted in a marked increase in CD 4 + 25 hifoxP 3 + cells (T regulatory cells) within the trachea when compared with a single challenge. In addition, adoptive transfer of 1 X 10 6 T regulatory cells taken from <b>thoracic</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes of multiple-challenged mice suppressed AHR in single-OVA recipients and T regulatory cell depletion restored AHR in vivo. These data suggest that multiple inhaled OVAchallenges altered the function of airway DC, resulting in reduced antigen uptake and processing, leading to limited CD 4 + T cell proliferation and/or recruitment to the airways. Furthermore these data show that administration of T regulatory cells suppressed AHR in established airways disease...|$|R
