The year after that Nelson occupied it with eight thousand English troops, and the following year the French reoccupied it and sacked the churches and imposed another fine nearly {{as great as the}} first. After the Napoleonic victories in the Italian wars, they seem to have come back again and fined the city two million francs more. They now remained five years, and in the mean time a Livornese, Giovanni Antonio Giaschi, invented a submarine-boat for attacking and destroying war-vessels, and a Spanish ship brought the yellow-fever. In 1808 Napoleon gave all Tuscany, and Leghorn with it, to his sister Elisa, but when in 1814 he was deposed, Leghorn was restored to the Tuscan grand-dukes and garrisoned for them by German troops, an earthquake having profited by the general disorder meantime to pay it another visit. The grand-duke now being driven out of Florence by Murat, he took refuge at Leghorn, which fell a prey to an epidemic of typhus. The first steam-vessel appared there in 1818, and in 1835 the Asiatic cholera; in 1847 a <b>telegraphic</b> <b>line</b> to Pisa was opened.|$|E

Several laws were established, helping the development of different types of industries in Norway. The honour for this goes mostly to Frederik Stang, but Løvenskiold must definitely have accepted and probably, at least to some extent, approved of this change. When Løvenskiold died in 1856, it was politically impossible to appoint a new governor. His anti-democratic attitude had left both him and the position isolated from most of the political establishment in Norway.|$|R

40|$|The Bourbon {{government}} began building its first telegraph lines in 1852. The first line starting in Naples headed northward, {{in order to}} reach the town of Terracina, a border station in the Papal State as well as a junction point with the papal <b>telegraphic</b> <b>lines</b> leading to Rome. At the same time, other telegraph lines headed south {{in order to reach}} the regions of Puglia and Calabria, and in particular the city of Reggio (Calabria), which would then allow Sicily to be connected as well, by means of a submarine cable. Intentions were not immediately followed by facts and the Naples- Reggio line was only completed with some delay, in 1856. At the beginning of 1857 the Bourbon central government appointed a highly skilled specialist, Ernesto D’Amico, as Royal Director (Delegate) in charge of the development of the electric telegraph network service in Sicily. The complex technical-administrative work started promptly and the first “temporary provisions for the performance of the service” were enforced. In December 1857, an Electric Telegraphy Directorate-General and a Scientific Committee formed by physicists, chemists and mechanics were each established in both Naples and Palermo. In Palermo, both the Directorate-General and the Scientific Committee dealt with many crucial matters, from the training of the Royal Telegraphic Corps and of local staff, the dispatch taxes and tariffs, the choice of equipment and materials, up to the classification and organization of telegraphic stations. As for the layout of the network lines, coastal routes were chosen. The reason was that the coastal routes had been used until then for visual or optical telegraphy, an ancient, well-organized and well-established coastal communication practice that had allowed for a good defence of the island against raids from the sea. The first Palermo-Messina line was opened in June 1857, {{and by the end of}} September, the entire telegraph network was completed, all along the coastal perimeter. At the same time, in January and June 1858, two submarine cables were laid along the Reggio-Messina Strait. After ups and downs related to break-downs, malfunctions, inadequate performance and new cable-laying works (nineteen in total!), the connection with the mainland, until then managed by sea, was finally achieved by cable in 1863...|$|R
50|$|In 1780 {{there was}} a lawsuit between Messrs. Joaquin Barrientos, Plácido Misas and Mr. Antonio De La Quintana who claimed rights over these lands, {{resolved}} in 1781 in favor of Messrs Barrientos and Misas, who were thenceforth the owners of Camp grounds and Yarumal. Campamento, which was a parish of Yarumal (decreed 23 April 1835, being governor of Antioquia Aranzazu), took that name {{in the wake of}} the Battle of White Chorros, 12 February 1820, in which General Jose Maria Cordova defeated General Francisco Warletta and finished with the last realistic redoubt in Antioquia. The first settlers of Campamento were people of Yarumal who arrived at the site in 1827 by insinuation of the priest of that population, gift Jose Antonio Palace Isaza, who is considered to be the founder. In 1830 the parish was created by request of the city council of Santa Rosa de Osos and in 1835 the population was given the status of municipality by decree of the Governor Juan de Dios Aranzazu. The first church in the municipality was destroyed by a fire and construction of the current one was completed in the middle of the 20th century (probably in 1954).

40|$|In a {{race between}} the {{railroad}} and the telegraph the "telegraphic candidates," Lewis Cass and William O. Butler, are {{first to the}} White House. The artist ridicules Zachary Taylor for his hazy stance on major campaign issues and manages a jibe at the "dead letter" affair as well. (See "The Candidate of Many Parties," no. 1848 - 24.) Other presidential candidates Henry Clay, Martin Van Buren, and a third (possibly John P. Hale) {{are also in the}} race, traveling in a small boat, on a horse, and in a wheelbarrow respectively. Taylor and his running mate Millard Fillmore ride a locomotive "Non-Comittal. No Principles. " along a track toward the White House (left). Taylor (seated on the engine) : "Why Fill, my boy, we must be on the wrong track!" Fillmore (in the cab) : "Yes, but if you hadn't dealt so much in the Mail line, it would have been all right!" The "Mail line" is a reference to the dead letter affair. Above them, Cass and Butler walk across telegraphic wires to enter a window of the White House. Cass, holding a sword (a memento of his 1812 military service), declares "I seek the people's eternal happiness!" Butler, holding onto Cass's coattail and thumbing his nose, yells back to Taylor "Zack, for old acquaintance sake I should like you to have been on the right side. " Butler, like Taylor, served as a general in the Mexican War. Butler also taunts Van Buren, who ambles along on a scrawny horse at the far right, "O, Marty how are greens?" Van Buren (in a mock-Dutchman's accent) : "O, mine got! Shonny! we pe a great deal mush pehind our time!" To the right of the train is a wheelbarrow from which protrude the legs and arms of another contestant, probably Liberty party candidate John P. Hale. A black man, representing abolitionism, lies on the ground beside the cart. Hale: "You d [...] d lazy niger get up and push along or we shall never get there!" Abolition: "De lor bless us all, me satisfy I go sleepey!" Henry Clay, in a sinking boat on the left, laments, "A pretty pass affairs have come to!" Samuel F. B. Morse had installed the first <b>telegraphic</b> <b>line,</b> linking Baltimore and Washington, in 1844. While still a novelty in 1848, the line may have a metaphorical significance in "The Telegraphic Candidates [...] & 1 as the symbolic path between Baltimore, where Cass and Butler were nominated, and Washington.

5000|$|Since that time, Borysław, as it {{was then}} called, was a small town related to the nearby {{metropolis}} of Lwów (currently Lviv, Ukraine) and mostly shared its fate. In 1772, during the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by Austria and became a part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. One of the great technological developments of the 19th century was the discovery by pharmacist Johan (Jan) Zeh (1817-1897, in nearby Lviv) of technology that led to the establishment of a new industry based on petroleum. Scientists worked out a method of distilling Boryslaw crude oil, and on 30 March 1853 made the first kerosene lamp. As early as 31 July 1853 their new lamp was used to illuminate the Public Hospital in Lvov. Their discoveries marked the beginnings of the rapid search for petroleum in the Carpathians—especially in the eastern sector of the mountain chain where rich oil deposits were discovered. In 1854 the first ozokerite mine was started in the town after the ore was discovered by Robert Doms. In the second half of 1853, following the research of Jan Zeh, and several other scientists working in the nearby city of Lemberg, the town and its surroundings saw the emergence of an oil industry. One of the first oil rigs in the world was built near Boryslav by Robert Doms in 1861. The oil and mining industries developed quickly. In 1909, more than 1,920,000 tonnes of oil were produced in the region—roughly 5% of the world's oil production at that time. The number of oil rigs also rose from 4,000 in 1870 to over 12,000 three years later. The oil boom drew many industry moguls from all over Austria-Hungary and many fortunes were earned and lost there. [...] A period of prosperity saw the city's population grew as almost 10,000 new workers arrived to the area. In 1886 an oil mining school was opened in Borysław, one of the first such facilities in Europe. Also the ozokerite, a natural mineral wax, mined in Borysław, was used for insulation of the first trans-Atlantic <b>telegraphic</b> cable <b>line.</b> On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borysław with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych, Ukraine) was opened.|$|R
