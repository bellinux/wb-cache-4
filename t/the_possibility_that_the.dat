5|$|The film {{generated}} more controversy {{through the}} 30-second rape scene, with threats made against the child actors, who originated from Afghanistan. Zakria Ebrahimi, the 12-year-old actor who portrayed Amir, {{had to be}} removed from school after his Hazara classmates threatened to kill him, and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan's Ministry of Culture banned the film from distribution in cinemas or DVD stores, citing <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> movie's ethnically charged rape scene could incite racial violence within Afghanistan.|$|E

Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian islands became older as one {{moved to}} the {{northwest}} was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived.

The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed {{to the sides of}} the main airway.|$|E
5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E

5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes of <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, {{as well as other}} factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Conybeare's {{presentation}} {{followed the}} resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy {{of one of the}} fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.|$|E

Holyoak also mentioned <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remains could represent a small subspecies of Necropsittacus or a wide-beaked form of Mascarinus, but maintained that they were best considered as belonging to a distinct species. The holotype specimen is a mandibular symphysis, with the specimen number UMZC 577a. Other known remains include upper mandibles, a palatine bone, and tarsometatarsi. The species has since been excavated from the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius, from which subfossils of most of the other endemic bird species have been identified as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, further {{measurements}} {{revealed the}} presence of a long-period planet in an orbit at around 5 AU from the star.

However, this period is close to the rotation period of 55 Cancri A, which led to <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 43-day period was caused by stellar rotation rather than a planet. Both the 43-day planet (designated 55 Cancri c) and the 5 AU planet (designated 55 Cancri d) were announced in the same paper, labeled in order of increasing distance from the star.|$|E
