5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition <b>that</b> <b>held</b> that {{the form of}} the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy <b>that</b> <b>held</b> that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
