5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. <b>The</b> <b>boots</b> {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. <b>The</b> <b>boots</b> originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Hermes– The former God of Speed and Commerce, the Messenger of the Gods, and {{the father}} of Ceryx. Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In God of War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia. Kratos eventually caught Hermes off guard, killed him, which released a plague on the world, and took his boots, <b>the</b> <b>Boots</b> of Hermes, as his own. The character was voiced by Greg Ellis in God of War III.|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as <b>the</b> <b>Boots</b> of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from <b>the</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence of witnesses and CCTV cameras, there was substantial forensic evidence linking him to the murders. Investigators found over a dozen bloodstains on his car, on his clothing and in his flat, all matching the victims. There were bloodstains on <b>the</b> <b>boots</b> with which he had kicked both Corcoran and Jordan, which he was still wearing {{at the time of}} his arrest. Smith had tried to clean his clothes in the bath of his flat along with a pair of trousers belonging to Corcoran, and a bag containing items belonging to Hyde was discovered outside. Detectives matched the tyre marks from his car, which had four different types of tyre, to the Worcestershire murder scene and to Corcoran's body, over which he had driven. Paintwork and fragments of glass found on Jordan's body matched those from Smith's car, including a broken light cluster which he had thrown into the car's boot.|$|E
5|$|Living in Brighton, Valiente took up {{employment}} in {{a branch of}} <b>the</b> <b>Boots</b> pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, {{she was involved in}} the founding of the Pagan Front, a British pressure group that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she who developed the three principles that came to be central to the Pagan Front's interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.|$|E

Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers.

5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and <b>the</b> <b>Boots</b> of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as a}} lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Trost was {{the costume}} {{designer}} for The FP; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence. She was also {{inspired by the}} fashions of Elvis Presley, and the films Double Dragon, Rocky, Mad Max, The Warriors, 8 Mile, Escape from New York, X-Men, {{as well as the}} works of John Carpenter. Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era. The 245's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army, while the 248's outfits were based on those of the Union Army. The flags of the gangs were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty. Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes were made from jumpsuits. <b>The</b> <b>boots</b> worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots. Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores, Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of <b>the</b> <b>boots</b> for a worldwide television audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles <b>the</b> <b>boots</b> were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E
5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to <b>the</b> <b>boots</b> of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E
