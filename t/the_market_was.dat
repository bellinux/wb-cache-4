5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
5|$|The Rochor Market, a wet market, {{was another}} popular {{landmark}} in this area. Built in 1872, it served the surrounding community {{for more than}} a century. In August 1982, part of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> demolished and its stalls were moved elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Swansea <b>Market</b> {{situated}} in <b>the</b> heart of Swansea city centre <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest indoor <b>market</b> in Wales. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> {{covered by a}} steel arched portal frame roof clad in steel and glass. <b>The</b> current <b>market</b> <b>was</b> built in 1959-1960 by Percy Edwards.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{version of}} the model compares a situation where initially <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> competitive to a situation where <b>the</b> post-merger <b>market</b> <b>is</b> not. However, if initially price exceeds marginal cost (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> not competitive), further increases in price have a [...] "first order" [...] effect on consumer surplus (graphically, they are trapezoids).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> {{operated}} by a non-profit organization, the Old Strathcona Farmers' <b>Market</b> Society. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> run mostly by volunteers with {{a small number of}} paid staff including current Executive Director, Stephanie Szakacs.|$|R
5|$|The Sibu Night Market was {{established}} in 1973. It was situated in the town centre. Local traders will usually set up their mobile stalls from 5pm to 10pm every day. The stalls offer household goods, footwear, fashion items, and varieties of food. In August 2012, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> relocated to Butterfly Garden at Cross Road near the Tua Pek Kong Temple to ease traffic jams.|$|E
5|$|Though Sega {{themselves}} only {{released the}} SG-1000 in Japan, rebranded versions were released in New Zealand by Grandstand Leisure and in Taiwan by Aaronix.

5|$|A {{weekly market}} was {{granted to the}} town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the {{junction}} of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction of the square began in 1983, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> moved to a car park in Bank Close. Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is then closed to traffic. Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town.|$|E

5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> <b>was</b> being built, a cut {{and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground City street level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market {{for the sale of}} goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After the start of the civil war, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate values have also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.|$|E

5|$|By the 1780s, {{local farmers}} {{had begun to}} hold {{informal}} market days, and advertised the town's ideal location between London, Chatham and the Kent Coast. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> held in the High Street until 1856, when local farmers and businessmen relocated to Elwick Road and formed a market company that is the oldest surviving registered company in England and Wales. There is still a regular street market in the town, but the market company relocated outside Ashford town centre after part of the 19th-century site was demolished {{to make way for}} the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. It is still used by around 5,000 farmers.|$|E
5|$|From May to October, the Haymaker Farmers' Market {{operates}} every Saturday {{morning in}} the downtown area adjacent to and under the Greer Bridge of Haymaker Parkway. The location is marked by a commissioned mural completed in October 2012 on the two bridge supports that line each side of the market's area. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> established in 1992 and includes over 40 vendors, {{making it one of the}} oldest and largest farmers' markets in Northeast Ohio.

Though she had intended to pursue chemical engineering as a career, she opted to attend medical school after graduating in 1972, believing <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> flooded with engineers. She {{attended the}} University of Kansas School of Medicine from 1972 to her graduation in 1975. Green chose emergency medicine as her initial specialty and undertook a residency in the Truman Medical Center Emergency Room after her graduation from medical school.|$|E

50|$|Abofour {{has also}} a market centre {{which takes place}} every Thursday in every week. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> {{attended}} by people {{from all parts of}} Ghana and even people from neighboring countries of Ghana. The high patronage has made <b>the</b> <b>market</b> one of <b>the</b> largest in Ghana. Some information indicate that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> about the fourth largest in Ghana in terms size and patronage. Due to lack of <b>market</b> facilities <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> held along <b>the</b> main Kumasi-Techiman highway which pose certain dangers to the traders and also cause traffic congestion.|$|R
50|$|As well as stalls selling {{fresh fruit}} and {{vegetables}} in general, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> also features a row of shops selling dates. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>is</b> next to Zayed Port and <b>the</b> Fish <b>Market</b> <b>is</b> close by too.|$|R
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Norsk Flytjeneste {{purchased}} two 50-passenger Douglas DC-6Bs from Braathens SAFE and leased {{one from}} Sterling Airways. They {{were used for}} domestic and international charter. The largest contract was from the Norwegian Church Aid, who contracted Norsk Flytjeneste to fly aid to Bangladesh. However, the airline failed to make money on the DC-6s, mostly {{because of the high}} operating costs, and sold them after a year. The company followed up with purchasing a ten-seat Cessna Citation business jet that they offered in the charter market. However, <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> not large enough, and the jet was sold.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian era, Norwich {{became an}} {{increasingly}} popular destination with travellers and {{developed into a}} fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and coaching inns. The eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19thcentury, but the council was unable {{to raise funds for}} improvement and few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the First World War the council's Markets Committee began a {{programme}} of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls, with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market. Within a few years <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> entirely publicly owned, and the council took responsibility for the upkeep of the market. The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area, transferring their licences to the growing suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The road {{over the}} pass was barely capable of {{handling}} the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first {{they had to be}} taken to Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants were built in the city soon afterwards, but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained. <b>The</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> growing {{in the wake of the}} Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>was</b> better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be {{the beginning of the end}} of American aerospace leadership.|$|E
