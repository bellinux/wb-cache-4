5|$|Junkin played {{four years}} of college {{football}} at Duke University. In the 1987 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns traded up to select him with the fifth overall pick. He played in parts of two seasons for the Browns, both of which ended early due to injury. Junkin was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round selection and played in five more games. After his release from the Chiefs, he did not play another game in the NFL. His failure to establish himself in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> caused him {{to be regarded as}} a draft bust.|$|E
5|$|The National Football League (NFL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) are {{the most}} popular {{football}} leagues in the United States. The National Football League was founded in 1920 and has since become the largest and most popular sport in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> the highest average attendance of any sporting league in the world, with an average attendance of 66,960 during the 2011 NFL Season. The NFL championship game is called the Super Bowl, and is among the biggest events in club sports worldwide. It is played between the champions of the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC), and its winner is awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> secured {{some limited}} {{antitrust}} exemptions since through the legislative process, {{the lack of}} a blanket exemption due to this decision has had a major impact on the subsequent history of football. Unlike Major League Baseball, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> faced several competing leagues since then (one of which merged with it) and seen five of its franchises move to new cities. Many of these actions have been accompanied by lawsuits brought against the NFL (often successfully) by competing leagues, public stadium-management authorities and its own owners.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the minor}} {{status of the}} sport in the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> played at least one game each season at Wembley Stadium since 2007. Wembley has hosted {{multiple}} games in each season since 2013, and the series has since expanded to include other locations in London. Twickenham began hosting NFL games in 2016, and the primary site for London games will switch from Wembley to the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium once it opens in 2018.|$|E
25|$|Bell lobbied Congress {{to pass an}} {{antitrust}} exemption {{after the}} decision, and had almost succeeded before he died. His successor, Pete Rozelle, continued the effort, but was only able to get limited exemptions to allow sharing of television revenues (the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961) and, later, the merger with the American Football League (AFL). Since the Court's ruling means professional football is covered under antitrust law, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> faced a number of competing leagues and lawsuits it would not otherwise be subject to.|$|E
25|$|The Rams' {{return from}} St. Louis to Los Angeles ended an {{interval}} lasting 21 {{years in which}} there was no NFL team in L.A. - the longest such period involving any NFL city of the post-merger era, and resulted in St. Louis replacing Los Angeles as the only 1969 NFL city without a current NFL team. <b>The</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> not simultaneously fielded teams in all sixteen of its 1969 markets since the Colts relocated to Indianapolis after the 1983 season. It had fielded teams in all ten 1969 AFL cities from the 2002 season (when the Texans joined the league) until the conclusion of the 2016 season (when the Chargers returned to Los Angeles, leaving San Diego without an NFL team).|$|E

25|$|The {{game has}} never been played {{in a region that}} lacked an NFL franchise. London, England has {{occasionally}} been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl in the near future. Wembley Stadium has hosted several NFL games as part of the NFL International Series and is specifically designed for large, individual events. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions. Time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30p.m. Eastern Time start would result in the game beginning at 11:30p.m. local time in London, an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports (<b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> never in its history started a game later than 9:15p.m. local time). As bids have been submitted for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LVI, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LVII in 2023.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{enormous}} [...] {{success of the}} National Football League's 1958 championship game, college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level. While both games benefited from the advent of television, since the late 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> become a nationally popular sport while college football has maintained strong regional ties.|$|E
500|$|The NFL {{continued}} to grow, eventually adopting some innovations of the AFL, including the two-point conversion. It has expanded {{several times to}} its current 32-team membership, and the Super Bowl has become a cultural phenomena across the United States.

500|$|Though the Lobos {{gained more}} first downs and yards on offense than the Midshipmen, their three {{turnovers}} and Navy's extended {{drive in the}} third and fourth quarters led to the lopsided final score. The 14-minute, 26-second final drive from the Midshipmen, measured by its 26 total plays, set a record for the longest drive in a game. Prior to the contest, the NCAA had not kept a record for longest drive, but began keeping track for the 2005 edition of the record book.

500|$|Injuries {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} big part of American Football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method {{that has been used}} to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this is the elimination of mass formations like the flying wedge in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused. Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL; a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later. The sharp {{decrease in the number of}} catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques. With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>has</b> passed rules prohibiting the targeting of [...] "defenseless" [...] players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses his helmet, and placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.|$|E
