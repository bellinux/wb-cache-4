5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in <b>the</b> <b>feature)</b> joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers at the close of <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> film, {{in the form of an}} excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in <b>the</b> <b>feature.</b> Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObservers usually cannot {{discriminate}} {{the relative}} depth of a crowded feature {{with respect to}} crowding features about 2 arc min distant if all <b>the</b> <b>features</b> have <b>the</b> same luminance. However, stereo thresholds significantly less than 20 arc sec are obtained when <b>the</b> crowded <b>feature</b> is about twice as luminant as <b>the</b> <b>features</b> crowding it. <b>The</b> thresholds depend only upon {{the ratio of the}} luminance of <b>the</b> target <b>feature</b> to <b>the</b> luminance of <b>the</b> crowding <b>features</b> and are independent of the absolute luminance of <b>the</b> <b>features.</b> With further increase in the relative luminance of <b>the</b> target <b>feature,</b> <b>the</b> performance eventually deteriorates and this deterioration is not due to difficulty in seeing <b>the</b> <b>features</b> which were individually clearly visible for all the luminances tested. The closest spacing of local crowded features that still allows good stereo discrimination is about the same as the spatial resolution attainable for many luminance-based non-stereo tasks...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>features</b> {{discussed}} so far {{are directly}} extracted from the data. In the detector, a fixed threshold is applied to <b>the</b> <b>features</b> {{to make a decision}} on the presence of speech.

5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{procedure was}} unique for the race; drivers' qualifying times set the starting grids for five heat races to determine <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> race's starting lineup, while {{the top five}} of a last chance qualifier (LCQ) advance to <b>the</b> <b>feature.</b> Schrader, Jared Landers, Timothy Peters, Kenny Wallace and Jeb Burton won the heat races, while Brennan Newberry won the LCQ. The feature's format was also distinctive compared to other NASCAR events, as it was divided into three segments, lasting 60, 50 and 40 laps. In <b>the</b> <b>feature,</b> Larson took the lead from Peters on lap 39, and later battled with Dillon for the win, and Dillon claimed the victory after he retained the lead on the green–white–checker finish for his fifth career Truck Series win.|$|E

After that we remove <b>the</b> other <b>features</b> in <b>the</b> classifier from <b>the</b> <b>features</b> present in <b>the</b> optimal set and run the process till the last generation.

5|$|Although the area's first Spanish explorers named <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> Mesa Verde, {{the term}} is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost {{perfectly}} flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park {{is made up of}} several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.|$|E
5|$|Anti-phishing {{integrates}} with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E

5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had provided some user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for Skyrim. This feature was pulled a few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future, but would review the implementation to avoid these previous mistakes. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with Rust being the first game to use <b>the</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|E
