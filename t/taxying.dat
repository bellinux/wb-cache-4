5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional <b>taxying</b> trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E
25|$|The biplane G-ABKW flew {{first on}} 10 June 1932 and the {{monoplane}} G-ABKV on 4 October 1932. The biplane {{turned out to}} be heavy to fly and with unreliable brakes making <b>taxying</b> difficult. Tailwheels were quite new at the time and the aircraft was troubled by shimmy. The monoplane posed fewer problems.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{provision}} for the attachment of beaching wheels: Each float had a watertight transverse tube, {{to which a}} mainwheel could be fitted, {{and there was a}} socket for a detachable swivelling tailwheel {{at the rear of the}} tailfloat, just forward of the <b>taxying</b> rudder. A side view photograph of the Sporting Type (taken at Olympia in July 1920), showing the port beaching-wheel in place, was published in Flight Magazine.|$|E

25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} longitudinal control, and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when <b>taxying</b> downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the upper aileron surface to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the bungee cord to return the ailerons was rigged between {{the top of the}} rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons.|$|E
25|$|In plan view, the twin-mainfloats, {{like those}} of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight {{increase}} in beam from front to rear, while the stern tapered to a point like a mitred arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal strips) and a sharp step at approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached {{to the rear of the}} tailfloat was a <b>taxying</b> rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.|$|E
25|$|The Bee, {{registered}} G-AEWC, first flew on 3 April 1937 at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by Hubert Broad. Engine cooling problems {{required a}} forced landing, {{and there were}} immediate comments on its sluggish handling {{in the air and}} on its cross-wind <b>taxying</b> problems due to the narrow track undercarriage. This was the Bee's only flight; before there was time to improve the cooling and handling, financial problems forced Carden-Baynes into Receivership in June 1937, and all development stopped. In November 1937, it was reported that production was on hold, until British engines became available. The Bee, its plans, and Carden-Baynes' design for a bigger aircraft were bought by the newly formed Scottish Aircraft Construction Co., but no more was heard of any of them apart from an uncertain report that the Bee was scrapped at Heston in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 May 1938, {{following}} an Empire Air Day display at Filton Aerodrome, the sole Type 146 struck a [...] "set-piece" [...] display while <b>taxying</b> and was damaged beyond economic repair. It {{was the last}} single-engined fighter to be built by Bristol.|$|E

2500|$|The date of {{the first}} flight by an {{aircraft}} of the type is not on record, but the issue of Flight dated 4 June 1910 carried {{a photograph of the}} aircraft and an article which records that several successful flights had been made by Cecil Grace, referring to the aircraft as No.27. [...] Both S.26 and S.27 were flying by 19 June 1910. S.26 was flown by G.C. Colmore, a complete novice who, after twenty minutes of <b>taxying</b> trials, completed two and a half circuits of the airfield before having to land because of trouble with the engine. The following day he succeeded in qualifying for his pilot's license, the fifteenth awarded by the Royal Aero Club.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the pioneer}} constructors started their own flying schools. [...] Pilot {{training}} was rudimentary: although the Wright Model A {{used by the}} Wright Brothers for training in Europe had been fitted with dual control, dual-control aircraft were not generally used, and aspiring pilots would often simply be {{put in charge of}} a machine and encouraged to progress from <b>taxying</b> the aircraft then short straight line flights to flights involving turns. [...] Sometimes ground handling experience was built up using special short-span machines that were incapable of flight, such as the Blériot Pinguin. [...] Most flight training was done early in the morning or in the evening when winds tend to be low, and the time taken to qualify for a licence was greatly dependent on the weather.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was tightly packed, {{leaving no}} room for fuel tankage or main landing gear. While the notched delta wing lacked the volume of a standard delta wing, each wing contained a fairly conventional three-section main fuel tank and leading-edge tank, holding the wing flaps also each contained a [...] fuel tank and an additional [...] was contained in a fuel recuperator, bringing the aircraft's total internal fuel capacity to [...] The main landing gear was sandwiched outboard of the main tanks and aft of the leading edge tanks, with the flap fuel tanks behind. The long main gear legs retracted towards the wingtip, necessitating an exceptionally thin main tyre inflated to the high pressure of [...] On landing the No. 1 engine was usually shut down when <b>taxying</b> to save brake wear, as keeping both engines running at idle power was still sufficient to propel the Lightning to 80mph if brakes were not used. Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid brakes were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Blériot {{established}} his first flying school at Etampes near Rouen in 1909. [...] Another was started at Pau, where the climate made year-round flying more practical, in early 1910 and in September 1910 a third was established at Hendon Aerodrome near London. [...] A {{considerable number of}} pilots were trained: by 1914 nearly 1,000 pilots had gained their Aero Club de France license at the Blériot schools, around half {{the total number of}} licences issued. [...] Flight training was offered free to those who had bought a Blériot aircraft: for others it initially cost 2,000 francs, this being reduced to 800 francs in 1912. [...] A gifted pupil favoured by good weather could gain his license in as little as eight days, although for some it took as long as six weeks. [...] There were no dual control aircraft in these early days, training simply consisting of basic instruction {{on the use of the}} controls followed by solo <b>taxying</b> exercises, progressing to short straight-line flights and then to circuits. [...] To gain a license a pilot had to make three circular flights of more than 5km (3mi), landing within [...] of a designated point.|$|E

50|$|<b>Taxying</b> {{trials of}} the F.3 began on 20 July 1934, but the {{aircraft}} was difficult to taxi safely, due to {{the combination of a}} short fuselage and a high centre of gravity.
