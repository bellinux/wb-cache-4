The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell {{you are one of the}} best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

I solicit {{the resignation of}} Prime Minister Victor Ponta", the president said after a meeting with Prime Minister Victor Ponta at the Cotroceni Palace. Shortly after Iohannis' request, Victor Ponta announced on Facebook that he doesn't resign, claiming that his term as prime minister depends on Parliament.

Former Justice Minister and current European Member of Parliament Monica Macovei thinks Ponta's insistence on remaining head of government [...] "is an act of betrayal that discredits Romania".|$|E
