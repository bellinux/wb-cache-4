5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> gradually moving back up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
50|$|The park {{consists}} of <b>the</b> two major <b>valley</b> systems of <b>the</b> Kidepo and Narus Rivers. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> lie between 3000 ft and 4000 ft AMSL.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that Tragöß was already {{inhabited}} by the ancient Celts. The centuries that followed the collapse, in western Europe, of the Roman empire was marked by a period of large scale migrations, and by the sixth century the Tragöß area was inhabited by Slavs, who made their homes not on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors,</b> but on <b>the</b> slopes that overlooked them. Bavarii and Franks followed in the ninth century, settling {{for the most part}} the fertile ground of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} Mojave Desert {{plants such as}} Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) and {{creosote}} bush (Larrea tridentata) on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> and alluvial fans and in the Sierra foothills. Higher Sierra elevations have single-leaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla).|$|R
5|$|In the Preclassic {{period the}} floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to {{seasonal}} flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> and undertook construction projects to protect the architecture of the city from the effects of flooding.|$|E
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders {{of various sizes}} and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the ALSEP lunar experiment deployment area, located west of the immediate landing site, the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than {{in other areas of}} the valley.|$|E
50|$|Autumn is {{generally}} pleasant, with {{one to two}} Pacific storm systems creating regional rain events. October {{is one of the}} driest and sunniest months in the Mojave; and temperatures usually remain between 70 F and 90 F on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R

50|$|The native {{vegetation}} {{continues to}} be under threat by introduced plant species ranging from non-native trees through to lupins, broom and non-native grasses. These are mostly contained in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> Tasman and Hooker Valley, since {{they are the most}} accessible parts of the park.|$|R
5|$|The area is not {{prominent}} on Brighton's skyline, {{but good}} views are possible from its streets, especially westwards and southwestwards towards {{the sea and}} across <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> in which Old Steine and the old town are situated. Tarner Park, an open space in {{the centre of the}} conservation area, offers long views through nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> widens, {{filled with}} farms and subdivisions {{as the road}} gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
50|$|Unusually for Martian <b>valleys,</b> <b>the</b> {{individual}} channel structures within <b>the</b> wider <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> can occasionally {{be seen in}} this system.|$|R
50|$|Tunnel valleys {{may remain}} open, {{partially}} filled or filled, {{as a function}} of the glacial recession. The filled configuration is significant because filled tunnel valleys become excellent reservoirs for either water (aquifer) or for oil. This results since relatively coarse-grained sandstones are located on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>valley</b> margins and <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> because <b>the</b> coarser-grained sediments settle out more easily and accumulate preferentially in the flowing water common to <b>the</b> tunnel <b>valley</b> fill stages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> park are narrow, most being {{between one}} and two {{kilometres}} wide. Many, such as <b>the</b> Gamsby <b>valley,</b> are covered by braided channels of gravel deposited by the rivers. The park has one major lake, Kitlope, which is fed by the Tezwa River and enters the Kitlope River near its estuary.|$|R
5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level {{crossing}} and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} in {{the area}} affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect {{and as a result}} the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining boulder clay. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.|$|E
50|$|Trexler Run {{flows through}} {{agricultural}} lands {{throughout much of}} its length. These lands are mostly on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> watershed. Forests are found on the ridges that surround the watershed. There is some land belonging to Nature Conservancy Priority Forest Hubs found {{in the northern part}} of the watershed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Valley</b> is {{surrounded}} {{in every direction}} except the northwest by steep mountains that at some points rise 7100 ft from <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor's</b> base elevation. It lies nearly encircled by the Wasatch Mountains on the east, the Oquirrh Mountains on the west, Traverse Ridge {{to the south and}} the Great Salt Lake on the northwest, with the peaks of Antelope Island visible.|$|R
50|$|The Peterborough drumlin {{field is}} a large physiographic feature {{to the north of}} the Oak Ridges Moraine. It has a {{northeast}} to southwest orientation, and is cut by a network of deep valleys with wide, flat <b>floors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>valleys</b> are steep-sided, and have a branching pattern. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> also exhibit inset eskers. The feature also extends south of the moraine.|$|R
5|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, {{is one of the most}} popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{is located}} {{in an area of}} fertile soils close to the Selegua and Viña rivers. The site is {{situated}} on a plateau overlooking the Selegua River, which flows {{to the west of the}} city. Deep ravines bordering the site to the south and east protected its access. The only access to the site is via a narrow land bridge to the north which unites the plateau to the general level of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b> The Zaculeu plateau measures 11,178 square varas (4191 square metres).|$|E
5|$|The hill {{is formed}} in layers {{from a variety}} of {{sedimentary}} rocks of Jurassic age. In common with the Cotswold plateau to the north, the summit is formed from rocks ascribed to the Chalfield Oolite Formation. The oolite together with the Fuller's Earth Formation which underlies it, forms a part of the Great Oolite Group of rocks of Bathonian age. Beneath these are, successively, Bajocian age limestones of the Inferior Oolite Group and sandstones of the Bridport Sand Formation. The last-named unit forms a part of the Lias Group of rocks of Toarcian age. Beneath all of these is the relatively thick Charmouth Mudstone Formation sequence rising from the edge of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> alluvium. All faces of the hill are subject to large areas of landslip.|$|E
50|$|Fast flowing clear {{mountain}} streams flow to <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> two basins {{to yield}} a more turbid water quality, especially during periods of peak rain. This site is known worldwide as the premier habitat for the jaguar (Panthera onca), which is most often found in the vast almost unexplored West Basin wilderness.|$|R
5000|$|Côtes du Roussillon-Villages is a sub-appellation in the {{northern}} half of the appellation in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> of <b>the</b> river Agly, from the best slopes around <b>the</b> <b>valley.</b> <b>The</b> appellation is {{in the foothills of}} the Pyrenees and the better wines are normally produced from vines on the slopes, not in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b> It is purely for red wines, with stricter appellation regulations than regular Côtes du Roussillon.|$|R
50|$|The Basin and Range Province is {{a series}} of linear block fault {{mountains}} with adjacent sediment-filled downfaulted valleys, having been caused by crustal extension around 17 million years ago. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> are made up of thick sediment deposits which have eroded off the mountains and filled <b>the</b> <b>valleys,</b> so that <b>the</b> region is a regular series of ridges spaced out by flat sediment valleys.|$|R
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points {{toward the center}} of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E
5|$|I-805 {{continues}} northward through San Diego, {{where it}} intersects SR94, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets SR15, {{the continuation of}} I-15. It then intersects El Cajon Boulevard before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for {{his involvement in the}} construction of several roads and highways in Southern California. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering reinforced concrete viaduct built in 1972, spanning over Mission Valley and the San Diego River. The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over I-8, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical stack interchange. The San Diego Trolley traffic also runs under the viaduct on <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b> The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} a typical {{tropical}} climate {{with a dry}} season from June to August and a rainy season from November to March.The highest parts of the Serra do Espinhaço have mild temperatures year round, with an annual average of about 18 C.The vegetation includes high rocky fields and cerrado, with luxuriant rainforest in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Columbian {{white-tailed deer}} {{is named after}} the Columbia River in Oregon and Washington where it congregates. Columbian white-tailed deer are found along the lower Columbia River, {{on a series of}} islands in Clatsop and Columbia {{counties}} in Oregon, and Wahkiakum County, Washington. Other populations are found in <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> Umpqua River basin.|$|R
