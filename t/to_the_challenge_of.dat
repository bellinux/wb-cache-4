5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
5|$|Kirk holds {{a hearing}} {{to decide the}} fate of Khan and his followers. The captain decides {{that they should be}} exiled to Ceti AlphaV, a harsh world that Kirk {{believes}} would be a perfect place for Khan to start his kingdom. Khan claims he is up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that {{it would be interesting to}} see what Khan makes of Ceti AlphaV in 100years.|$|E
5|$|With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had {{to carry}} most of the load in her junior season, with help from {{returning}} teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class of Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 {{was supposed to be}} a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E

25|$|This {{decrease}} {{in the amount of}} money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure. Supplementing the use of gold in this period was the British pound. Based on the dominant British economy, the pound became a reserve, transaction, and intervention currency.

The Chevette also managed to outsell larger hatchbacks including the Austin Maxi and Chrysler Alpine.|$|E
25|$|The BBC Home Service was the {{predecessor}} of Radio 4 and broadcast between 1939 and 1967. It had regional variations and was broadcast on medium wave with {{a network of}} VHF FM transmitters being added from 1955. Radio 4 replaced it on 30 September 1967, when the BBC renamed many of its domestic radio stations, in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> offshore radio. It moved to long wave in November 1978, taking over the 200kHz frequency previously held by Radio 2, and later moved to 198kHz {{as a result of}} international agreements aimed at avoiding interference.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia {{established}} a bid committee to host matches for the 1994 World Cup {{which was to}} be played in the United States. Phillies president Bill Giles was on the Philadelphia bid committee and hoped to use Veterans Stadium for games. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> installing a natural grass field for the games, FIFA would have required the Phillies to vacate the stadium for a month to allow for sufficient preparation time prior to the matches. Giles could only offer 17-days. Of the nine venues eventually chosen to host matches, not one was home to a professional baseball club.|$|E
25|$|In 1959 Come Back, Africa {{film about}} Apartheid {{mentions}} the religion {{as part of}} the discussion on the philosophical underpinnings of how the Africans were to respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> Apartheid. The mention of the religion begins about 1 hr 10 min into the film, after the performance of Miriam Makeba. It is not known if the cause of the mention of the religion was scripted or improvised, and if by the choice of Lionel Rogosin, the filmmaker (who may have encountered the religion in Israel or the USA) or the Africans themselves because of their exposure to the religion in the country.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{from the}} armored {{divisions}} that received them {{prior to the}} end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37mm. The M24 was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions.|$|E

25|$|The Blue Jays {{started the}} 2002 season with slow {{progress}} in performance. Buck Martinez was fired {{about a third}} of the way through the season, with a 20–33 record. He was replaced by third base coach Carlos Tosca, an experienced minor league manager. They went 58–51 under Tosca to finish the season 78–84. Roy Halladay was relied on as the team's ace and rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> being the team's top pitcher, finishing the season with a 19–7 record and 2.93 ERA. The hitters were led once again by Carlos Delgado. Promising young players were assigned to key roles; starting third baseman Eric Hinske won the Rookie of the Year Award at the season's conclusion, and 23-year-old centre fielder Vernon Wells had his first 100 RBI season.|$|E
25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no one seemed to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E
25|$|Brown’s {{performance}} and subsequent reputation were mixed. Major General Charles H. Corlett, then commanding the XIX Corps, thought Brown needed a medical leave {{because he was}} sick and “rundown.” One of Brown’s battalion commanders thought Brown was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> commanding large units in combat and described him as “frantic.” Bradley, now a lieutenant general, commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, and General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), believed Brown was personally brave, but not an inspirational leader, and that his soldiers underperformed as a result. Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, such as Major Generals Terry Allen and Orlando Ward, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he not be given another command. Marshall concurred. Brown was replaced by Brigadier General James Edward Wharton, who {{was killed by a}} sniper while visiting the front-line soon after he took command. He, in turn, was replaced by Brigadier General Norman Cota, formerly the ADC of the 29th Infantry Division.|$|E

40|$|Thesis: This paper {{examines}} {{existing literature}} <b>to</b> determine whether <b>the</b> Marine Expeditionary Unit-Special Operations Capable (MEU (SOC)) program is appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anticipated <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenty-first century. Discussion: Specifically the paper examines the potential Operations Other Than War (OOTW) threat facing the MEU (SOC) {{as seen in}} the problem of understanding the difference between the soldier and the warrior in the Third World littorals. For purposes of this discussion OOTW and Low-Intensity Conflict (LIC) will be used interchangeably. Credibility and capability of the MEU (SOC) are examined <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> viability of the MEU (SOC) program as an appropriate counter-measure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most likely future threat. The areas of crisis response, power projection, force employment, and operational reach are examined in relation to MEU (SOC) operations in the Third World littorals. Conclusion and Recommendations: The MEU (SOC) program is appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenty-first century, but as the future threat grows in complexity, the areas of Civil-Military relationships, MEU (SOC) structure, and Strategic Sealift will require enhancement.
