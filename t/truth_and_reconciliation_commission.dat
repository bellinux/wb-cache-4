5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the <b>Truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Commission</b> of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{offered a}} public apology {{on behalf of}} the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the Canadian House of Commons. Nine days prior, the <b>Truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Commission</b> (TRC) was {{established}} to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project involves a comparative, cross-national study of <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> (TRCs) in {{countries around the}} world that have used these extra-judicial institutions to pursue justice <b>and</b> promote national <b>reconciliation</b> during periods of democratic transition or following a civil conflict marked by intense violence and severe human rights abuses. An important objective of <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> involves instituting measures to address serious human rights abuses that have occurred as a result of discrimination, ethnocentrism and racism. In recent years, rather than solely utilizing traditional methods of conflict resolution and criminal prosecution, transitional governments have established <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> as part of efforts to foster psychological, social and political healing. The primary objective of this {{research project}} is to determine why there has been a proliferation of <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> around the world in recent decades, and assess whether the perceived effectiveness of these commissions is real and substantial. In this work, using a multi-method approach that involves quantitative and qualitative analysis, I consider the institutional design and structural composition of <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions,</b> as well as the roles that these commissions play in the democratic transformation of nations with a history of civil conflict and human rights violations. In addition to a focus on institutional design of <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions,</b> I use a group identity framework that is grounded in social identity theory to examine the historical background and sociopolitical context in which truth commissions have been adopted in {{countries around the world}}. This group identity framework serves as an invaluable lens through which questions related to <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> other transitional justice mechanisms can be explored. I also present a unique theoretical framework, the reconciliatory democratization paradigm, that is especially useful for examining the complex interactions between the various political elements that directly affect the processes of democratic consolidation <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> in countries in which <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> have been established. Finally, I tackle the question of whether successor regimes that institute <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> can effectively address the human rights violations that occurred in the past, and prevent the recurrence of these abuses.

5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the <b>Truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Commission</b> to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} some of {{the main}} features of so-called <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions,</b> their history <b>and</b> structure and their characteristic concerns with respect to their central dilemmas, including: how they grapple with notions of truth, justice, liability, <b>reconciliation,</b> apology <b>and</b> forgiveness, and how they address the need to support the “reconstruction ” of selves and identities in the wake of massive trauma and collective violence. A particular concern is with how such commissions or related tribunals engender what can be called a “one-to-many ” dynamic, in which they try to effect social reconciliation while focusing attention, via testimony and story-telling, on the traumas and suffering of individual victims.

40|$|How can peace be {{effectively}} achieved after conflict? Experts from academia and practice explore {{in this book}} examples of post-conflict resolution and its history as well as issues pertaining to different mechanisms to achieve national reconciliation whether via courts, <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> international prosecution. In {{the first section of}} this book, 'beyond the courts' mechanisms are analysed: apologies, <b>truth</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconciliation</b> <b>commissions,</b> <b>and</b> amnesties. The case studies section of the book is based on reports of field missions organised by the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in the following post-conflict States: Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Then, legal issues in international prosecution such as selectivity, and the effect of international prosecution and domestic courts are discussed. Finally, the issue of reparation for victims is explored with specific regard to women and children. This book forms part of the ATLAS project (Armed Conflicts, Transitional Justice, Peacekeeping: Law as Solution) which is funded by the 7 th Framework Programme of the European Commission. It has a great appeal to many and is particularly relevant to students, academics and practitioners in the field of international law and human rights law in post-conflict State...|$|R
