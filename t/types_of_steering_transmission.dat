50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R

40|$|The main target <b>of</b> a <b>steering</b> {{system is}} that the driver can change vehicle {{trajectory}} {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power steering types include; Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro - Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental <b>type</b> <b>of</b> Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel off angle to the left wheel off angle.

40|$|Municipal {{authorities}} are taking an increasing {{importance in the}} delivery of active labour market policy. The subject of this thesis is the transition in the regulation of Danish local employment policy from state regulation towards further market and network orientation. The newest legislation “Lov om ansvaret for og styringen af den aktive beskæftigelsespoilitik” has made it compulsory for all local municipalities to use different kinds <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> in the active labour market policy. The new steering conditions confront the municipalities with new challenges which {{are at the heart of}} this thesis. The theoretical framework consists <b>of</b> three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> steering; hierarchical <b>steering,</b> market steering and network steering. These approaches emphasize different factors that contribute to effective steering. The big challenge is thus to make all three kinds <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> work simultaneously without undermining each other, thereby ensuring the objective of effectivity. A case study method is applied focusing on Hillerød Kommune, where the three kinds <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> are contributing to the local active labour market policy in accordance with the present legislation. It demonstrates if and how Hillerød Kommune has succeeded in using the three kinds <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> simultaneously. The thesis consists of three connected analyses: The purpose of the first analysis is to examine the capacity linked to market steering in order to increase effectivity. To do so we compare the hierarchical steering with the market steering, which is reflected in the performance of the public versus the private operator in Hillerød Kommune. The focus of the second analysis is the interaction between market- and network steering. We highlight what influence the contracting out of the employment service has had on the existing and statutory network steering in Hillerød Kommune. The third analysis deals with the ability of Hillerød Kommune to prevent steering failure. The first two analyses draw attention to the importance of not only the use of, but also the connection between the three kinds <b>of</b> <b>steering.</b> The challenge for Hillerød Kommune is to steer strategically and reflect upon the pros and cons connected to marked, hierarchy and network in order to be able to secure an effective <b>steering</b> <b>of</b> the local active labour market policy. The thesis concludes that the implementation <b>of</b> market <b>steering</b> has had a negative impact on the development of a successful network steering in Hillerød Kommune. This is not only a consequence <b>of</b> market <b>steering</b> deficiencies, but also the result of the excessive focus of Hillerød Kommune on the market steering and quantifiable results. Furthermore the analysis shows that market steering does not contribute to a more effective active labour market policy than the hierarchical steering in Hillerød Kommune. However, the element of competition has had a positive effect on the employment service in Hillerød Kommune in general. When combining different forms <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> the analysis indicates that it is important that the local municipalities clarify their role as meta-governors and remember not only to regulate the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering,</b> but also the mutual relations and interplay between the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering...</b>|$|R

30|$|Some piping {{systems have}} a {{branched}} part. Therefore, in-pipe locomotive devices {{must be able}} to travel forward and backward, and turn to proceed into a branched pipe. Because of this requirement, many researchers have focused on the realization of a steerable in-pipe device.

To simplify the design and reduce the number of motors, Nishimura et al. [11] proposed a differential mechanism that allows locomotion, rotation, and steering to be realized with only two motors. Debenest et al. [12] designed a spring mechanism to eliminate the need of a separate motor to control steering. Additionally, a steering mechanism has been included in certain inchworm devices to enable path selection in branched piping systems.

40|$|Given {{the growing}} number of older drivers, {{accurate}} functional assessment of fitness to drive is becoming increasingly important. This paper describes work to define appropriate thresholds for cognitive, perceptual and physical tests on a static assessment rig (SAR). These rigs are used at Mobility Centres across the UK to provide measurements of driving characteristics as part of an assessment. However, criteria for decisions on functional fitness to drive have not been clearly defined or validated for SARs. A first study obtained normative data from the non-disabled driving population for each of the SAR tests. In the second study, disabled drivers were tested on the SAR; approximately half of these drivers used some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering,</b> braking or accelerator adaptation. Following these two studies, criteria for the SAR tests were formalised and then validated by means of an experimental trial. Recommendations are made regarding the use of the SAR as part of the overall assessment process and for future research. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we study {{tripartite}} quantum steering, which is weaker than genuine tripartite steering, {{in two different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> scenarios, where two parties perform two qubit projective measurements and the other party performs two black-box dichotomic measurements. We derive steering inequalities by using {{the structure of the}} Svetlichny and Mermin Bell-type inequalities for detecting tripartite steering in these two scenarios. It is demonstrated that these steering inequalities also detect genuine tripartite steering when the violation is greater than certain bound. We also consider two biseparability inequalities which detects genuine tripartite entanglement of 2 × 2 × 2 systems in the two steering scenarios that we have considered. It is shown that tripartite steering in the two particular steering scenarios considered implies the presence of genuine tripartite entanglement of 2 × 2 × 2 quantum system, even if the correlation does not exhibit genuine nonlocality or genuine steering.

In the second experiment, the unexpected rear-end scenario concluded a stretch of driving otherwise unrelated to the study presented here. Across both experiments, novice drivers were found to collide more often than experienced drivers in the unexpected scenario.

40|$|In quantum mechanics, if {{one party}} {{performs}} a measurement on one system, different outcomes {{can lead to}} different states for another system. This phenomenon is known as quantum steering. The thesis begins with some general results about steering: a classification of which states permit the most powerful <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>steering,</b> {{and the implications of}} this for quantum correlations. The first main topic is steering in two-qubit systems. It turns out that steering provides an excellent way to visualize two-qubit states, leading to a novel criteria for entanglement and a better understanding of separable states. Oddly, the structure <b>of</b> <b>steering</b> can be more subtle in separable states than it can be in entangled ones. Returning to general quantum systems, I then turn to the EPR paradox, and its generalisation using Local Hidden State models. I show that the lack of such models can be used to quantify the amount of entanglement shared by two parties, even when one of them does not trust their measuring devices. Finally, the desire to understand steering without invoking "spooky action-at- a-distance" leads to the idea that quantum states are states of knowledge. I explore some de Finetti theorems that help to make sense of this idea, but then show a significant roadblock the most natural formalisation of it.
