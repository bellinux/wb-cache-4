40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to integrate different types of medium access control (MAC) protocols into a single wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) network system. The WDM network is based on a passive star coupler, and the purpose of integrating different MAC protocols is to efficiently accommodate various types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> with different characteristics and quality of service demands. Our integrated MAC protocol is termed multimedia wavelength-division multiple-access (M-WDMA). Three types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> are considered in this paper: constant-bit-rate traffic and, two classes of variable-bit-rate traffic. Accordingly, three tunable transmitters and one fixed home channel receiver are used in the design of each WDM node. The transmitters transmit the three types of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> in a pipeline fashion so as to overcome the tuning time overhead and to support para e transmissions of <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> that emerge simultaneously. We further incorporate a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme that dynamically adjusts the portions of bandwidth occupied by the three types of <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> according to their demands. Consequently the M-WDMA protocol achieves high utilization and efficiently adapts {{to the demands of the}} multimedia streams so as to guarantee their QoS. The performance of the M-WDMA is evaluated through a simple analytical model and extensive discrete-event simulations. It is shown that the M-WDMA can satisfy the QoS requirements of various mixes of multimedia <b>traffic</b> <b>streams</b> even under very stringent requirements. Moreover, we show that the M-WDMA outperforms conventional MAC protocols for WDM networks. As a result, we expect M-WDMA to be a good multimedia MAC candidate protocol for future-generation WDM networks...|$|R
