5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a <b>tyrosinase</b> inhibitor. <b>Tyrosinase</b> catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is needed}} by the body {{for a number of}} functions, {{predominantly}} as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase and <b>tyrosinase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme <b>tyrosinase.</b> The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{significant}} interest in developing biotechnological applications of <b>tyrosinases.</b> These applications include the production of L-DOPA (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine) from L-tyrosine, the production of cross-linked protein networks for use as novel food additives and the detection of phenolic compounds in wastewater or their removal from it. Much of the research into these applications has involved mushroom <b>tyrosinases.</b> We review the potential biotechnological applications of mushroom <b>tyrosinases</b> and evaluate the state of knowledge about their production, recovery and immobilization. We conclude that much more research is necessary in these areas if mushroom <b>tyrosinases</b> are to fulfill their biotechnological potential...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims Following {{previous}} findings of high extracellular redox activity in lichens {{and the presence}} of laccases in lichen cell walls, the work presented here additionally demonstrates the presence of <b>tyrosinases.</b> Tests were made for the presence of <b>tyrosinases</b> in 40 species of lichens, and from selected species their cellular location and molecular weights were determined. The effects of stress and inhibitors on enzyme activity were also studied...|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called <b>tyrosinase</b> that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} <b>tyrosinase,</b> the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
25|$|Loss of {{methionine}} {{has been}} linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in <b>tyrosinase</b> effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color.|$|E

50|$|Phenoloxidase are copper {{containing}} <b>tyrosinases.</b> These proteins {{are involved}} in the process of sclerotization of arthropod cuticle, in wound healing, and humoral immune defense. Phenoloxidase is synthesized by zymogens and are activated by cleaving a N-terminal peptide.|$|R
50|$|PPO {{causes the}} rapid {{polymerization}} of o-quinones to produce black, brown or red pigments (polyphenols) that cause fruit browning.

25|$|The TYR gene encodes {{the enzyme}} <b>tyrosinase,</b> which is {{involved}} in the production of melanin from tyrosine. It has an allele, Ser192Tyr (rs1042602), found solely in 40–50% of Europeans and linked to light-colored skin in studies of both mixed-race South Asian and African-American populations.|$|E
25|$|Albinism may {{manifest}} itself as oculocutaneous (OCA) or just ocular (OA). There occur {{at least ten}} different types of OCA and four types of OA. OCA refers {{to a group of}} autosomal recessive disorders in which melanin is reduced or even absent leading to pale skin with increased risk of skin cancer. OCA1 is caused due to mutations in <b>tyrosinase</b> gene affecting its catalytic or synthetic activity. OCA2 is a condition where TYR gene is not mutated but the P polypeptide is. Mutational defects in TRP-1 protein leads to OCA3.|$|E
25|$|A male white tiger named Cheytan, {{a son of}} Bhim and Sumita born at the Cincinnati Zoo, died at the San Antonio Zoo in 1992 from {{anaesthesia}} complications during {{root canal}} therapy. It appears that white tigers also react strangely to anaesthesia. The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744, but a few tigers, white ones in particular, undergo a re-sedation effect 24–36 hours later. This is due to their inability to produce normal <b>tyrosinase,</b> a trait they share with albinos, according to zoo veterinarian David Taylor. He treated a pair of white tigers from the Cincinnati Zoo at Fritz Wurm's safari park in Stukenbrock, Germany, for salmonella poisoning, which reacted strangely to the anaesthesia.|$|E

25|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} behind {{human skin}} color is mainly {{regulated by the}} enzyme <b>tyrosinase,</b> which creates {{the color of the}} skin, eyes, and hair shades. Differences in skin color are also attributed to differences in size and distribution of melanosomes in the skin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin. The most common form of biological melanin is eumelanin, a brown-black polymer of dihydroxyindole carboxylic acids, and their reduced forms. Most are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Eumelanin is found in hair, areola, and skin, and the hair colors gray, black, blond, and brown. In humans, it is more abundant in people with dark skin. Pheomelanin, a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in red hair, the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and <b>tyrosinase,</b> depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|Melanophores contain eumelanin, {{a type of}} melanin, {{that appears}} black or dark-brown because of its light {{absorbing}} qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell. Eumelanin is generated from tyrosine {{in a series of}} catalysed chemical reactions. It is a complex chemical containing units of dihydroxyindole and dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid with some pyrrole rings. The key enzyme in melanin synthesis is <b>tyrosinase.</b> When this protein is defective, no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism. In some amphibian species there are other pigments packaged alongside eumelanin. For example, a novel deep (wine) red-colour pigment was identified in the melanophores of phyllomedusine frogs. This was subsequently identified as pterorhodin, a pteridine dimer that accumulates around eumelanin core, and it is also present in a variety of tree frog species from Australia and Papua New Guinea. While it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments, it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively.|$|E

40|$|Plant polyphenols, {{including}} dietary polyphenols such as resveratrol, {{are important}} {{components in the}} plant antioxidant and defence systems. They are also known to exert beneficial effects on human health through diet. As they are produced, these polyphenols may be subjected to deleterious enzymic oxidation by the plant polyphenol oxidases. They are generally synthesized as glycosides like 5, 4 '-dihydroxystilbene- 3 -O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, the 3 -glucoside of resveratrol. The effects of the glycosylation and methylation of the parent resveratrol on its enzymic oxidation were studied. Methyl and glucosyl derivatives were synthesized using simple one-step methodologies. The kinetics of their enzymic oxidation by <b>tyrosinases</b> were defined. Substitution at the p-hydroxy group, by either glucose or methyl, abolished enzymic oxidation by both mushroom and grape <b>tyrosinases.</b> Substitution at the m-hydroxy group with methyl had a small effect, but substitution with glucose resulted in a much lower affinity of the enzymes for the glycoside. We suggest that glycosylation of polyphenols in nature helps to protect these vital molecules from enzymic oxidation, extending their half-life in the cell and maintaining their beneficial antioxidant capacity and biological properties...|$|R

500|$|The {{intensity}} of black pigment on yellow Labradors {{is controlled by}} a separate gene independent of the fur colouring. Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called [...] "snow nose" [...] or [...] "winter nose"). This {{is due to a}} reduction in the enzyme <b>tyrosinase</b> which indirectly controls the production of melanin, a dark colouring. <b>Tyrosinase</b> is temperature dependent—hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather—and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.|$|E
500|$|Melanin is {{an organic}} pigment that {{produces}} {{most of the}} colour seen in mammals. Depending on how it is created, melanin comes in two colour ranges, eumelanin (producing dark browns and blacks) and pheomelanin (producing light reddish tans and blondes). The dark and light melanins have their influence either alone or in conjunction, making either plain or multi-coloured coats. [...] Sometimes, in a condition called agouti, they make multi-coloured individual hairs. [...] The production of melanin occurs in melanocytes in a complex process involving the enzyme <b>tyrosinase.</b> [...] Mammals have a gene that codes {{for the presence of}} <b>tyrosinase</b> in cells – called the TYR gene. [...] If this gene is altered or damaged, melanin cannot be reliably produced and the mammal becomes an albino. Besides the TYR gene, several other genes can cause albinism. [...] This is because other hormones and proteins are involved in melanin production, the presence of which is genetically determined. In mice, a total of 100 genes are known to affect albinism.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} cDNA clones coding for {{portions of the}} very large polypeptide chain of Octopus dofleini hemocyanin were isolated and sequenced. These data reveal two very similar coding sequences, which we have denoted "A-type" and "G-type. " We have obtained complete A-type sequences coding for functional units Ode and Odf; consequently {{a total of three}} such unit sequences are now known from a single subunit of one molluscan hemocyanin. This presents the opportunity to make sequence comparisons within one hemocyanin subunit. Domains within one subunit show on the average 42 % identity in amino acid residues; corresponding functional units from hemocyanins of different species show degrees of identity of 53 - 75 %. Therefore, molluscan hemocyanins already existed before the individual molluscan classes diverged in the early Cambrian. Sequence comparisons of molluscan hemocyanins with arthropodan hemocyanins and <b>tyrosinases</b> allow us to identify the ligands of the "Copper B" site with high probability. Possible ligands for the "Copper A" site are proposed, based on sequence comparisons between molluscan hemocyanins and <b>tyrosinases.</b> Besides two histidine side chains, a methionine side chain might be involved in binding of Copper A, a result not in conflict with spectroscopic studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>tyrosinases</b> to activate tyrosine residues of wool protein fibres for cross-linking with different materials like collagen, elastin and gelatine was assessed. Natural fibres like wool offer an excellent {{environment for the}} growth of micro-organisms when the conditions like moisture, oxygen and temperature are appropriate. Coating with collagen, a very useful biomaterial with bactericidal and fungicidal properties, could be used to improve the properties of wool-based materials, especially when applied in hygienically sensitive applications like in hospitals. <b>Tyrosinases</b> were shown to catalyse the oxidation of tyrosine residues in wool and wool hydrolysates as model substrates, as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Structural differences of the surface were evident from the increase of the intensity in the NH bending and stretching regions in the spectra of NIR FT Raman analysis of the enzyme treated and grafted wool fibres. The durability of the coating was also shown by using FITC-labelled collagen that was bound to the wool fibres, even after severe washing. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were successfully imparted due to the collagen grafted on the wool fibres. The functional and mechanical properties of the treated wool fibres showed no significant changes...|$|R

500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the Mascarene parrot in life. Since several {{specimens}} were kept alive in captivity, it was probably not a specialised feeder. That the Vienna specimen was partially white may have been the result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity; the clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged. Little was known about parrot-diet in the 1700s, and the Vienna specimen may not have received enough of the amino acid tyrosine through its food, which it would have needed for melanin synthesis. In other parrots, this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in the affected feathers, due to the presence of the pigment psittacin, but Coracopsis parrots and the Mascarene parrot are the only parrots that lack this pigment. The specimen has also been described as [...] "partially albinistic" [...] at times, though true albinism (lack of the enzyme <b>tyrosinase)</b> can by definition never only be partial.|$|E

On the basis of the phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method, vertebrate <b>tyrosinases</b> and molluscan hemocyanins constitute one family, whereas pro-POs and arthropod hemocyanins group with another family.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Hemocyanins are oxygen {{transport}} molecules {{found only}} in molluscs and arthropods. They are very large molecules with molecular weights {{in the range of}} several million Daltons. They are multisubunit aggregates and their oxygen binding site contains a binuclear copper center. Molluscan and arthropodan hemocyanins are fundamentally different in structure and it has been of interest for a long time whether both proteins are products of divergent or convergent evolution. It was clear that sequence data were needed from both proteins in order to resolve this question. Our laboratory is investigating the structure and function of Octopus dofleini hemocyanin. It consists of ten polypeptide chains of 350, 000 Da each. Each subunit is composed of seven domains. In order to sequence hemocyanin recombinant DNA methods were chosen, because conventional protein sequencing methods seemed not feasible. Complementary DNA clones coding for three domains at the C-terminal end of hemocyanin were isolated and sequenced. Comparison of these sequences with those of arthropodan hemocyanins showed no similarity, except for a small region corresponding to the "Copper B" site. Molluscan hemocyanins are more closely related to <b>tyrosinases</b> than they are to arthropodan hemocyanins. Sequence comparisons with domains of other recently published molluscan hemocyanins showed that molluscan hemocyanins already existed in the precambrian before the molluscan orders diverged from each other in the early cambrium.
