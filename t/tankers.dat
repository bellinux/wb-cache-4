5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude <b>tankers</b> and product <b>tankers.</b> Crude <b>tankers</b> move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product <b>tankers,</b> generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E

Named , Conch and Clam, {{each had a}} capacity of 5,010long tons of deadweight. These three ships were the first <b>tankers</b> of the Tank Syndicate, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.|$|E

5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil <b>tankers</b> have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil <b>tankers</b> have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E

5|$|To {{extend the}} Hornet's range, {{four of the}} RAAF's six Boeing 707 {{transport}} aircraft were converted to <b>tankers</b> in the early 1990s; the first Boeing 707 tanker entered service in 1990. The <b>tankers</b> were operated by No. 33 Squadron and supported the Hornet units until the 707s were retired in 2008. These aircraft were replaced with KC-30A tanker-transports in 2011.|$|E
5|$|With {{facilities}} {{prepared in}} Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, the fledgling Shell company {{was ready to}} become Standard Oil's first challenger in the Asian market. On August 24, 1892, Murex became the first tanker {{to pass through the}} Suez Canal. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil <b>tankers,</b> compared to Standard Oil's four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing <b>tankers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Oil <b>tankers</b> {{are only}} one source of oil spills. According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills. Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil <b>tankers,</b> while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker spills are much more rare and much more serious than spills from non-tank vessels.|$|E
5|$|Some sub-types of oil <b>tankers</b> {{have evolved}} to meet {{specific}} military and economic needs. These sub-types include naval replenishment ships, oil-bulk-ore combination carriers, floating storage and offloading units (FSOs) and floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs).|$|E
5|$|The American airmen {{achieved}} considerable success against Japanese convoys. Two {{waves of}} aircraft from Task Group 38.3 attacked {{a convoy of}} 10 ships escorted by the seven warships of the 101st Flotilla near Quinhon in central Indochina and sank four fully loaded oil <b>tankers,</b> three freighters, the light cruiser Kashii and three small escort vessels. Another convoy was located and struck near Cape Padaran in southern Indochina, resulting {{in the loss of}} a tanker, two destroyer escorts and a patrol boat. A convoy comprising seven vessels was also attacked near Cape St. James in southern Indochina, leading to two freighters, three <b>tankers,</b> three destroyer escorts and a landing craft being sunk or forced to beach.|$|E

It is {{an updated version of}} the KC-767, originally selected as the USAF's new <b>tanker</b> aircraft in 2003, designated KC-767A, and then dropped amid conflict of interest allegations. The KC-767 Advanced <b>Tanker</b> is derived from studies for a longer-range cargo version of the 767-200ER, and features a fly-by-wire refueling boom, a remote vision refueling system, and a 767-400ER-based flight deck with LCD screens and head-up displays. Boeing was awarded the KC-X contract to build a 767-based <b>tanker,</b> to be designated KC-46A, in February 2011.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tanker</b> (or tank ship or tankship) is a {{merchant}} vessel designed to transport liquids or gases in bulk. Major types of tankship include the oil <b>tanker,</b> the chemical <b>tanker,</b> and gas carrier. In the United States Navy and Military Sealift Command, {{any type of}} <b>tanker</b> used to refuel other ships is called an oiler.|$|R
5|$|The KJRM had two <b>tankers,</b> one {{for oil and}} one for water. The {{oil tanker}} was sunk in Italian hands in 1943, and the water tanker was deleted {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, the eastern sea routes of the country were attacked by German U-boat submarines. United States naval defence was very limited and largely obsolete; between January and April 1942, among other naval losses, 46 oil <b>tankers</b> were sunk and 16 damaged. The problem was made worse as 50 <b>tankers</b> {{had been sent to}} help the UK earlier in 1941. Insurers began to refuse to underwrite the remaining vessels and the volume of crude oil reaching the north-east from the Texas Gulf dropped.|$|E
5|$|A spur {{was built}} near Rhosgoch to {{facilitate}} the building of an oil tank farm in the 1970s. This was built to receive oil from <b>tankers</b> moored offshore in the deep waters off Amlwch, before it was pumped to the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire. The site was decommissioned after a short life, but the short spur remains.|$|E
50|$|A {{mid-deck}} oil <b>tanker</b> is a <b>tanker</b> design {{which includes}} an additional deck intended to limit spills if the <b>tanker</b> is damaged. The extra deck is placed {{at about the}} middle of the draft of the ship. This design is an alternative to the double-hull <b>tanker</b> design, and is superior in terms of spill volume.|$|R

5|$|By comparison, in 1970 1.44 billion {{metric tons}} of oil were shipped by tanker. This {{amounted}} to 34.1% of all seaborne trade for that year. In terms of amount carried and distance carried, oil <b>tankers</b> moved 6,487 billion metric-ton-miles of oil in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Fewer deck {{officers}} are employed on bulkers than on similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulker carries {{two to three}} deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize bulkers carry four. Liquid natural gas <b>tankers</b> {{of the same size}} have an additional deck officer and unlicensed mariner.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 <b>tankers</b> that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to <b>tankers</b> also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E

5000|$|... 22:23 - {{the bomber}} and the <b>tanker</b> {{initiated}} the head on rendezvous at 70 nautical miles. Normal mileage countdown was {{used and the}} bomber turned the <b>tanker</b> at 21 NM. This left Doe 11 flying at 280K IAS approximately 11NM behind the <b>tanker</b> after the <b>tanker</b> rolled out on refueling track. The bomber asked the <b>tanker</b> to slow down. The <b>tanker</b> reduced speed to 200K IAS, and then to 185K IAS. The bomber maintained 280K IAS to approximately 2NM behind this <b>tanker,</b> and then lost power. The pilot had warned the crew earlier {{of the possibility of}} bailout and he now alerted them to prepare for bailout. He initiated a 30 degree bank to the west toward a clear area as all engines flamed out together at approximately 22:40 hours after takeoff.|$|R
