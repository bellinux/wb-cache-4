5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities {{as far away as}} Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrow II, {{raising his}} son Kavadh II, {{also known as}} Siroes, in his stead. Khosrow was shut in a dungeon, where he {{suffered}} for five days on bare sustenancehe {{was shot to death}} slowly with arrows on the fifth day. Kavadh immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> empire was also near exhaustion. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, and most importantly for them, the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E

Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder finds it blank due to a power surge during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.|$|E

5|$|Zieten had by {{this time}} brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become {{concerned}} {{at the sight of}} stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid.|$|E
5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 {{of a heart}} embolism. His {{father did}} not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from {{bronchial}} pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{played with}} bands from the Boston area, {{including}} {{for two years}} with violinist Ray Perry, who encouraged Byard to add tenor saxophone to his array of instruments. He then joined Earl Bostic's band as pianist in 1947 and they toured for around a year. Byard then formed a bebop band with Joe Gordon and Sam Rivers in Boston, before touring for a year with a stage show band. Back once more in Boston, he had a regular job for three years with Charlie Mariano in a club in nearby Lynn. They recorded together in 1953. Byard {{was a member of}} Herb Pomeroy's band as a tenor saxophonist from 1952 to 1955, and recorded with him in 1957. Byard also played solo piano in Boston in the early to mid-1950s and freelanced in that area later in the same decade. He joined Maynard Ferguson in 1959, and stayed until 1962. As one of Ferguson's players and arrangers, Byard found <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> preference for experimentation in time signatures, harmony and freer improvisation was restricted by the preferences of other band members.|$|E

When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at this young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. Initially he played in the youth teams for Tamil Nadu as a batsman who was learning to keep wicket, and was regarded by Robin Singh as having very high levels of fitness.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe {{to the front lines}} where he was forced to agree <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire to the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E
5|$|Support for Liddell's story {{came from}} Cecil Williamson, {{founder of the}} Museum of Witchcraft, {{who claimed to have}} known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner. However, Williamson was an {{unreliable}} source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding past events. Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's claims are unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist Charles Leland. Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in Storrington, Sussex. Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill. Liddell himself has been critical of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.|$|E

5|$|Yellowfang's Secret was {{released}} on 9 October 2012. It is a Super Edition about the former medicine cat of ThunderClan, Yellowfang and her life in ShadowClan. It follows Yellowfang as she first trains to be a warrior, then a medicine cat, as Sagewhisker tells her that her paws are not meant for shedding blood. She decides to switch {{to the role of}} medicine cat instead because she can feel the injuries of all the other cats in ShadowClan. A few moons later she breaks the code of medicine cats when she gives birth to kits; as a result, she and her whole Clan are punished for her disloyalty to the code, as her only surviving kit, Brokenkit proves to be vicious, bloodthirsty, and driven only by ambition, qualities <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> father, Raggedstar, ignores. In the end, Yellowfang herself is cast out of ShadowClan to live as a rogue by her own kit, now having gone on to follow in his father's footsteps and become Brokenstar for a crime she did not commit.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
