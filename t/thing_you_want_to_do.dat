[...] The band signed to independent label Restless Records and began work on their third album {{at the start of the}} same year. The album was recorded at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City in May and June 1990 with engineer Oz Fritz. As with the band's prior albums, Poss was the sole producer of the album.
