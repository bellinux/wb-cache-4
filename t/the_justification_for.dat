5|$|A reduced fear of {{persecution}} encouraged the resistance movements; anti-integration protests accompanied high-profile visits to East Timor {{including that of}} Pope John Paul II in 1989. The end of the Cold War removed much of <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> western support of Indonesia's occupation.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{announced}} its {{surrender to the}} Allies on August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war. On September 2, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, effectively ending World War II. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still debated to this day.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E

5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once all the signs were removed. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attacks}} on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF air campaign, they had an effect on other American operations. After {{determining}} that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> {{the closure}} of Loring was that the Air Force had six more {{strategic}} bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E

25|$|Although Antietam was a {{tactical}} draw, it meant the strategy behind Lee's Maryland Campaign had failed. President Abraham Lincoln used this Union victory as <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> announcing his Emancipation Proclamation, which effectively ended any threat of European {{support for the}} Confederacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> Iwo Jima's {{strategic}} {{importance to the}} United States' war effort has been that it provided a landing and refueling site for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were ever flown from Iwo Jima.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> {{this was}} that when wages are higher, the supply of labor will {{increase}} relative to demand, creating an excess supply and thus depressing market real wages; when wages are lower, labor supply will fall, increasing market real wages. This would create a dynamic convergence towards a subsistence-wage equilibrium with constant population.|$|E

50|$|The South African Republic {{government}} first instituted discriminatory legislation against Indians in 1885, {{which led}} to protests from the British authorities, as the Indians were British Subjects, and was used as one of <b>the</b> <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Boer War.|$|R
25|$|It is {{said that}} <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the {{employment}} of eunuchs as high-ranking civil servants was that, since they were incapable of having children, {{they would not be}} tempted to seize power and start a dynasty. In many cases, eunuchs were considered more reliable than the scholar officials. A similar system existed in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|According to Hartmann (1982), {{the women}} who sought employment, based on various surveys and public opinion reports at the time {{suggests}} that financial reasoning was <b>the</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> entering the labor force; however, patriotic motives made up another large portion of women's desires to enter. Women whose husbands were at war were {{more than twice as}} likely to seek jobs.|$|E
25|$|The Øresund Bridge was {{designed}} by the Danish engineering firm COWI. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel {{for part of the}} way, rather than raising that section of the bridge, was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport, to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad, and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait.|$|E

25|$|Knowledge-representation is {{the field}} of {{artificial}} intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world {{that can be used}} to solve complex problems. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems. Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of the reproduction rights holders was unprecedented in United States copyright law. Almost thirty-nine percent of the royalties collected under the AHRA go not to songwriters and musicians, but to the record labels who own the right to copy and distribute their recordings. <b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> this cross subsidy is that the copying enabled by the digital technology is a loss of profits for the recording industry, {{and that they should}} be compensated for this loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> this {{definition}} {{is to preserve}} {{the sign of the}} result in case of arithmetic underflow. For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(x/2), where x = ±2−149, the computation x/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching x, and the result will be ±∞ with sign matching x. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2150, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.|$|E
