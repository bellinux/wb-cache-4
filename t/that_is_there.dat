The proof by Jarkko Kari is related to the tiling problem by Wang tiles.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Joseph Smith was killed, {{he had already}} {{organized}} four incomplete quorums of seventy. By 1845, there were ten quorums of seventy. The seventies in the first quorum became the seven presidents {{for each of the}} other quorums; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> were 63 presidents, 7 for each of the 9 other quorums, and the seven remaining members were the presidency of the first quorum.

Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E
25|$|The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem {{shows that}} if a first-order theory of {{cardinality}} λ has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality {{greater than or equal}} to λ. One of the earliest results in model theory, it implies that it is not possible to characterize countability or uncountability in a first-order language. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>there</b> is no first-order formula φ(x) such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).|$|E
