5|$|While Abercrombie had {{expected}} {{the battle to}} begin at 1 pm, by 12:30 elements of the New York regiments on the left began engaging the French defenders. The sounds of battle led Haviland {{to believe that the}} French line might have been penetrated, so he ordered his men forward, even though not all of <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> were in place, and Abercrombie had not given an order to advance. The result, rather than an orderly, coordinated advance on the French position, was a piecemeal entry of <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> into the battle. As companies of <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> came forward, they arranged themselves into lines as instructed, and then began to advance. The right column, with a shorter distance to travel, attacked first, followed by the center, and then the left. The 42nd had initially been held in reserve, but after insisting on being allowed to participate, they joined the action.|$|E

5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E
5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces {{were the first}} to attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There was too much tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>regulars</b> and reserves—at {{least on}} paper—totalled a mobilised force of almost 700,000 men, {{although}} only 150,000 men were immediately available to be formed into the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) {{that was sent}} to the continent. This consisted of six infantry divisions and one of cavalry. By contrast, the French Army in 1914 mobilised 1,650,000 troops and 62 infantry divisions, while the German Army mobilised 1,850,000 troops and 87 infantry divisions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>regulars</b> found {{themselves}} {{trapped in a}} situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.|$|E

5|$|After Stillman's defeat on May 14, <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> and militia {{continued}} up the Rock River {{to search}} for Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at {{not being able to}} find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families. As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding. Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at Ottawa, Illinois, on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea.

From 1909, he was also one of <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his colleague at Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it.

The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt.

5|$|On {{the west}} side of the hill was a shallow creek (Burnett Creek), and on the east side a very steep embankment. Because of the nature of the position, Harrison did not order {{temporary}} works to be created around the position, as was ordinarily done by encamped armies. The Yellow Jacket company, with Captain Spier Spencer in command, was posted on the southern end of the camp perimeter. The rest of the militia formed a rectangular formation along the edges of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation. <b>The</b> <b>regulars,</b> commanded by Major Floyd, and the dragoons, commanded by Maj.

40|$|The main {{methods for}} {{improving}} the efficiency or power of the combined cycle are: increasing the inlet temperature of the gas turbine (TIT), inlet air-cooling, applying gas reheat, steam or water injection into the gas turbine (GT), and reducing the irreversibility of the {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG). In this paper, gas reheat with recuperation was applied to <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> triple-pressure steam-reheat combined cycle (<b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle) by replacing the GT unit with a recuperated gas-reheat GT unit (requires two gas turbines, gas recuperator, and two combustion chambers). <b>The</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle with gas-reheat and gas-recuperation (<b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle) was modeled including detailed modeling of the combustion and GT cooling processes and a feasible technique to reduce the irreversibility of its HRSG was introduced. <b>The</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle and <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle with reduced-irreversibility HRSG (the Reduced Irreversibility cycle) were compared with <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle, which is the typical design for a commercial combined cycle. The effects of varying the TIT on the performances of all cycles were presented and discussed. The results indicate that the Reduced Irreversibility cycle is 1. 9 - 2. 15 percentage points higher in efficiency and 3. 5 % higher in the total specific work than <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle, which is 3. 3 - 3. 6 percentage points higher in efficiency and 22 - 26 % higher in the total specific work than <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle. <b>The</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat and Reduced Irreversibility cycles are 1. 18 and 3. 16 percentage points; respectively, higher in efficiency than the most efficient commercially-available combined cycle at the same value of TIT. Economic analysis was performed and showed that applying gas reheat with recuperation to <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle could result in an annual saving of 10. 2 to 11. 2 million US dollars for a 339 Â MW to 348 Â MW generating unit using <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> cycle and that reducing the irreversibility of the HRSG of <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle could result in an additional annual saving of 11. 8 million US dollars for a 439 Â MW generating unit using <b>the</b> <b>Regular</b> Gas Reheat cycle.

5|$|The {{companies}} under Pitcairn's command got {{beyond their}} officers' control {{in part because}} they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They fired in different directions and prepared to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, who was just arriving with the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>regulars,</b> heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and <b>the</b> <b>regulars</b> the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and hope that they had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E

Feeling that Caroline does not want her there, Betty considers moving into a retirement home, however is convinced to stay in Weatherfield by her close friend Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Around the time of Betty's fortieth anniversary at the Rovers Return, she is sacked by new manager Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque) after clashing with her on several occasions. Landlord Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) eventually tires of Poppy's poor treatment of the staff and fires her. Betty is re-instated, and plays the fairy godmother in the 2009 Rovers Return Christmas pantomime performance of Cinderella.
