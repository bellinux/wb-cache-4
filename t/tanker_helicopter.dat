By June 11, over 400 persons were fighting the fire, and hotshot crews and bulldozers were utilized to create fire breaks. Air <b>tankers</b> and <b>helicopters</b> were also used to dump water and fire retardant near homes threatened by the fire. A temporary [...] "tent city" [...] was established at Skyview High School to house firefighters and support staff, and a no fly zone was established around the fire area. Smoke from the fire and others blazing simultaneously in Interior Alaska contributed to a visible haze of smoke over Anchorage and much of south-central Alaska.
