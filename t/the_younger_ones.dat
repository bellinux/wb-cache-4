5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E

25|$|Maria {{died at the}} age of 38 from uterine cancer. She {{married the}} same day as her younger sister Charlotte, in the church at Guiseley, after her fiancé had celebrated the union of two other couples. She was a literate and pious woman, known for her lively spirit, joyfulness and tenderness, and it was she who {{designed}} the samplers that are on display in the museum, and had them embroidered by her children. She left memories with her husband and with Charlotte, the oldest surviving sibling, of a very vivacious woman at the parsonage. <b>The</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones,</b> particularly Emily and Anne, admitted to retaining only vague images of their mother, especially of her suffering in her sickbed.|$|E
25|$|With peace {{restored}} in Germany, the Crown Prince was constantly sent abroad {{to represent the}} Berlin court.

Despite the death of Sigismund, the royal family continued to grow with the arrival of four new children between 1866 and 1872. While the elder children (William, Charlotte and Henry) were left in the care of governesses, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> (Sigismund, Viktoria, Waldemar, Sophia and Margaret) were raised personally by Victoria, which was a point of conflict with both her mother and mother-in-law.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, when Pedro was eight, the Zamoras left Cuba for the United States {{during the}} Mariel Boat Lift. After {{five days of}} {{processing}} in Cuba, the entire family was set to board on May 30, 1980, when, hours before they were to do so, Cuban officials ruled that his four older brothers were too close to draft age and had to remain. His oldest sister, a communist official, chose to stay. The older siblings insisted, over their parents’ objections, {{that the rest of}} the family go to the U. S. without them so that <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> could have a better life. Zamora's parents took him, his sister Mily, and his brother Jesus onto a boat filled with 250 people that had been built for half that number. For most of Pedro's life the Zamoras resided in Hialeah, Florida, a suburb of Miami where, in part as a result of the family’s continuing separation, Pedro became very close to his mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{became interested}} in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> whose pastime it became to develop them. At {{the centre of the}} children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Brontë gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as the Young Men, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form, and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in little books, the size of a matchbox , and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.|$|E
25|$|The Banggai {{cardinalfish}} is {{the only}} member of its family that is diurnal. It is a demersal tropical marine fish that forms stable groups of about 9 individuals in shallow water, being most common at 1.5 to 2.5 meters in depth. It inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and open areas of sand and rubble. It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands. It is often found associated with the seagrass Enhalus acoroides and the long spined sea urchin Diadema setosum. It occurs among various living benthic substrates such as sea urchins, sea anemones, and branching corals; young fish are most commonly associated with sea anemones, while juveniles and adults occur most frequently among long-spined sea urchins and branching corals, as well as sea stars, hydrozoans, and mangrove prop roots. Individuals of 2 to 60 hover above the urchins, with <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones</b> about 2 to 3 centimeters SL staying closest to them. The fish retreat among the spines when threatened. Individual fish exhibit well-defined homing behaviour and return to the original location of their group when disturbed. The Banggai cardinalfish often coexists with various anemonefish and anemone shrimp when sheltering in anemones and corals; when found among sea urchin spines, it associates with several other genera of cardinalfish. Following removal of the fish by aquarium collectors, the abundance of associated invertebrates has been shown to decline.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time since the show debuted, the {{producers}} and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Streets content and structure, and studied how children's viewing habits had changed. The analysis was conducted during a series of two-week-long workshops and was completed in time for the show's 30th anniversary in 1999. [...] The CTW found that although the show was produced for children between the ages of three and five, their viewers had become more sophisticated since its debut and began to watch the show sooner, as early as ten months of age. [...] The producers found that the show's original format, which consisted of a series of short clips similar to the structure of a magazine, was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers' attention. They also found that their viewers, especially <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones,</b> lost attention with Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.|$|E

Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>ones,</b> lost attention in Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.|$|E
