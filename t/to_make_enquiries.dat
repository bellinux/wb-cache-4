500|$|In Newgate prison, Bellingham was {{questioned}} by [...] magistrates. His calm demeanour and poise led them, unlike Hume, to doubt his sanity, although his keepers had observed {{no signs of}} unbalanced behaviour. James Harmer, Bellingham's solicitor, knew that insanity would provide the only conceivable defence for his client, and despatched agents to Liverpool <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries</b> there. While awaiting their reports he learned from an informant that Bellingham's father had died insane; he also heard evidence of Bellingham's supposed derangement from Ann Billett, the prisoner's cousin, who had known him from childhood. On 14 May a grand jury met in the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and after hearing evidence from the eyewitnesses, found [...] "a true Bill against John Bellingham {{for the murder of}} Spencer Perceval". The trial was arranged to take place the next day, Friday 15 May 1812, at the Old Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, two SS {{members were}} given shelter at the Ratzinger family house, and they [...] began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries</b> about the {{presence}} there {{of a young man}} of military age. Joseph Ratzinger, Sr. made clear to these SS men his ire against Adolf Hitler, but the two disappeared the next day without taking any action against the Ratzinger family. Cardinal Ratzinger wrote in his memoirs: [...] "A special angel seemed to be guarding us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ranjitsinhji's fame {{increased}} after 1896, {{and among}} the praise for his cricket were hints in the press {{that he intended to}} pursue a political career, following other Indians in England. Instead he began to turn his attention to the Nawanagar succession, beginning <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries</b> in India as to his position. Meanwhile, he began to cultivate potentially beneficial connections; at Queen Victoria's jubilee celebrations, he established a friendship with Pratap Singh, the regent of Jodhpur, whom he later falsely described as his uncle. Ranjitsinhji decided to return to India to further his case, prompted by the decision of Vibhaji's grandson Lakhuba to dispute the succession. Meanwhile, the financial expectations of behaving as a prince pushed Ranjitsinhji even further into debt, and his allowance had been stopped after he had been given an advance on it to cover earlier money owed. He wrote to Willoughby Kennedy, the English Administrator of Nawanagar, asking for money but none was forthcoming. His financial situation eased when a serious illness confined him to the house of an acquaintance. He took the opportunity to begin work on a cricket book which a publisher had invited him to write; Ranjitsinhji contributed seven chapters and other writers contributed the rest, then he and Fry revised the book together while travelling through Europe in the spring of 1897. The book was released in August 1897 under the title The Jubilee Book of Cricket, and was a success, both commercially and with the critics: [...] the review by Francis Thompson was entitled, [...] "A Prince of India on the Prince of Games". Nevertheless, he was approaching bankruptcy by the end of 1897 and there are indications, such as an increased temper, that he felt the pressure.|$|E

His appearance caused a slight buzz of recognition among the audience, and if Yeovil had cared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiry</b> of his neighbours he might have learned that this decorated and obviously important personage was the redoubtable von Kwarl, artificer and shaper of much of the statecraft for which other men got the public credit.|$|R

Adverts therefore serve as agents between organizations and customers. In this paper, a mobile agent based model that would help its users to place timely and effective adverts is described.

There was no necessity, now, to go down the line <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries</b> as to the progress of the stores, or of the laden craft on their way up. the telegraph was established, and the Sirdar, at Atbara, knew the exact position of every one of the units between Cairo and himself; and from every station he received messages constantly, and despatched his orders as frequently.|$|E

The mechanism extends second score auction design to settings where the quality is uncertain and it provides incentives to both collect information and deliver desired qualities. ...|$|R

6000|$|At {{one end of}} the Wiltshire {{village where}} I was staying there was a group of half-a-dozen cottages {{surrounded}} by gardens and shade trees, and every time I passed this spot on my way to and from the downs on that side, I was hailed by a loud challenging cry--a sort of [...] "Hullo, who goes there!" [...] Unmistakably the voice of a jackdaw, a pet bird no doubt, friendly and impudent as one always expects Jackie to be. And as I always like to learn the history of every pet daw I come across, I went down to the cottage the cry usually came from <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries.</b> The door was opened to me by a tall, colourless, depressed-looking woman, who said in reply to my question that she didn't own no jackdaw. There was such a bird there, but it was her husband's and she didn't know nothing about it. I couldn't see it because it had flown away somewhere and wouldn't be back for a long time. I could ask her husband about it; he was the village sweep, and also had a carpenter's shop.|$|E

I therefore propose to send men north from London to enquire upon all the principal roads. A man with a violin and a little child cannot have been altogether forgotten in the villages in which he stopped, and I {{hope to be able}} to trace his way up to Yorkshire. Again, I should employ one of the Bow Street runners <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enquiries</b> in London for a man with his wife and child who lived here so many years ago, and whose name was Gilmore. I am supposing, you see, that that was his real name, and not one that he had assumed. I confess I have my doubts about it. A man who quits his home for ever after a desperate quarrel is as likely as not to change his name. That of course we must risk. While these enquiries are being made I should like you to go back to your old home; it is possible that other mementoes of his stay there may have escaped the memory of the old people with whom you lived. Anything of that kind would be of inestimable value.” ...|$|E
