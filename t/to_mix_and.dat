5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E

However, its popularity is somewhat overshadowed by soto, a similar hearty warm soup dish, which is often consumed with rice instead of noodles. In modern households, it is common practice <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> match the recipes of laksas; if traditional laksa noodle is not available, Japanese udon noodles might be used instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} demand system {{exhausts}} gas {{to the environment}} at ambient pressure (or a very small difference from ambient pressure required to open the exhaust valve). As a result, all exhaled gas is lost to the surroundings. For most surface orientated commercial diving where air is the breathing gas in use, this is no problem, as air is cheap and freely available. Even with nitrox it is generally more cost effective to use open circuit, as oxygen is an easily available and relatively inexpensive gas, and blending nitrox is technologically simple, both <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> to analyse.|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E

Indie rock band Pavement (who also toured with Stereolab) acknowledged the group's sound on their song [...] "Half A Canyon." [...] Stereolab alumni have also founded bands of their own. Guitarist Sean O'Hagan {{went on to}} form The High Llamas, while keyboardist Katharine Gifford created Snowpony with former My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. Sadier herself has released three albums with her four-piece side-project Monade, whose sound Mark Jenkins called a [...] "little more Parisian" [...] than Stereolab's.

500|$|The {{initiator}} {{used in the}} implosion {{design of}} the Fat Man bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was code-named [...] "urchin". In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of the explosion, the initiator had to emit a large number of neutrons in a few microseconds while the plutonium core was fully compressed. At the heart of the urchin was a solid beryllium sphere [...] in diameter. This was gold-plated and coated with [...] of polonium. The gold kept the polonium's alpha particles from striking the beryllium. [...] This fitted inside two beryllium hemispheres with 15 parallel grooves cut into the inner surface. These grooves converted the shock wave of the implosion into jets that shattered the spheres and caused the beryllium and polonium <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> emit neutrons. The hemispheres were nickel-plated and the outer surface was coated in gold and [...] of polonium. The [...] initiator, which was hot to the touch, fitted neatly inside the [...] hole {{in the center of the}} plutonium pit.|$|E

2500|$|... 4-chambered hearts. Mammals {{and birds}} have four-chambered hearts. Non-crocodilian {{reptiles}} have three-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they allow oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> therefore send some de-oxygenated blood {{out to the}} body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians' hearts are four-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern mammals and birds. They also have a bypass that makes then functionally three-chambered when under water, conserving oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Philadelphia is {{the home}} of many culinary institutions, both gourmet and local staples. The city's {{immigrant}} history has allowed many tastes <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> develop. The cheesesteak, created in Philadelphia in the 1930s, is a well known city icon. A popular Philadelphia argument is which of two cheesesteak rivals has the best steaks, Pat's Steaks, which invented the cheesesteak, and Geno's Steaks. Italian ice (often referred to exclusively as [...] "water ice" [...] in the Philadelphia area) and soft pretzels were not invented in Philadelphia, but because of their popularity and availability have become Philadelphia staples. Irish potato candy is a popular Philadelphia confection that is especially popular around St. Patrick's Day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1881 Lilly {{formally}} {{incorporated the}} business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected {{a board of}} directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates. Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898. In 1883 the company contracted <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a [...] "blood purifier" [...] and {{as a treatment for}} syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.

2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. I remember looking at a lot of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E

His was the hard, clear, invulnerable passion of the bones, finely tempered and unchangeable. She was the flint and he the steel. But in continual striking together they only destroyed each other. The fire was a third thing, belonging to neither of them.|$|E
