5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha has a bullring (praça de touros) in Nossa Senhora do Pópulo, inaugurated on 13 June 1883. The {{octagonal}} arena originally seated 4,000 spectators, but now has {{capacity for}} 3,250. In a typical year, the ring hosts {{between three and}} six bullfights. The arena also hosts concerts. The Grupo de Forcados Amadores das Caldas da Rainha (Amateur Forcado Group of Caldas da Rainha) participate in a phase of the Portuguese bullfight wherein they attempt to immobilize the bull by grabbing it, using no tools but <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> bodies.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> their feet. Their {{fingers and toes}} are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E

Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also very stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. The diets of wild slow lorises are poorly understood. Signs of an inappropriate diet in captivity include tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are often sleeping when the nocturnal pet is normally awake.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress while {{standing}} on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, {{and she and her}} backup dancers are particularly shown clapping <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than <b>their</b> <b>hands)</b> <b>and</b> only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E

5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E

5|$|Doom 3 is a story-driven action {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. As with {{previous}} Doom games, the main {{objective is to}} successfully pass through its levels, defeating a variety of enemy characters intent on killing the player's character. Doom 3s more story-centered approach, however, means that the player often encounters friendly non-player characters, who provide key plot information, objectives and inventory items. The game incorporates ten weapons for the player's use to survive, including conventional firearms and explosives such as a submachine gun, shotgun and grenades, experimental plasma weaponry, and the traditional BFG 9000 and chainsaw weapons of the Doom franchise. Enemies come in multiple forms and with different abilities and tactics, but fall into two broad categories of either zombies or demons. Zombies are humans possessed by demonic forces, who attack the player's character using <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> melee weapons or a variety of firearms, while demons are creatures from Hell, most of which attack using claws and spines, or by summoning plasma-based fireballs. The corpses of demons are reduced to ashes after death, leaving no trace of their body behind.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are on <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more {{members of the new}} race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species {{tends to}} be seasonal, {{particularly}} in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include {{the length of the}} wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (hoofed mammals). Infant care by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet.|$|E

5|$|The Zoroastrians {{moved to}} India in {{successive}} migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest {{has been characterized}} as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{in order to protect}} themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the island of Hormuz and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is a scarcity of sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on Qissa-i Sanjan written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan written more than 200 years later. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} there were already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period. According to the legend, at the beginning of the 10th century a small group of Zoroastrians living around the town of Nyshapour and Fort of Sanjan in the province of (greater) Khorasan, decided that Iran was no longer safe for Zoroastrians and their religion.The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan (Gujarat), which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan).|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E
