5|$|Glatter {{has noted}} that the episode exemplifies the themes of longing and desire which she feels {{characterize}} the series; she has also called to attention its careful balance between <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> comic elements. Exterior scenes in the episode were filmed in California's Angeles National Forest and blended with stock footage of Washington to enhance the setting.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more transitory but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{continues}} {{to say that}} though Greek and Roman society functioned well with <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> violent content in theatres because {{it was part of}} the traditions specific to the time and place, putting these plays in a French context would be far more dangerous. However, tragedies are not as dangerous as comedies, because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a {{reversal}} in sentiment about slavery {{took place in the}} life of Moses Brown, one of four Rhode Island brothers who, in 1764, organised and funded the <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> fateful voyage of the slave ship named Sally. Moses Brown broke away from his three brothers, became an abolitionist, and converted to Christian Quakerism. During the 19th Century, Quakers such as Levi Coffin {{played a major role in}} helping enslaved people escape through the Underground Railroad. Quaker Paul Cuffee, a free black sea captain and businessman, was active in the abolitionist and resettlement movement in the early part of that century.|$|E
25|$|The Clan Ranald {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> unique shipwrecks in Australian waters. It {{represents}} one of the worst shipwrecks in Australian history with a massive loss of life. Combined with the grave sites of the officers and the crew in the nearby Edithburgh Cemetery, the Clan Ranald is a somber reminder of a huge tragedy. For this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, not only because of the disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. Even to this day, if you visit the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E

25|$|Gilliam {{repeatedly}} said in interviews {{that the character}} of Parnassus was meant autobiographically, a tale of an aging man with a vivid imagination {{in a world that}} doesn't listen any more. Still being caught in depression over the disruption of his last self-written project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, his constant struggle with the established studio system, as well as becoming aware of his progressing age, worried that he was going nowhere with his latest projects and that he might not have much time left, Gilliam put a number of references to sudden, <b>tragic,</b> <b>and</b> premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality. In fact, Gilliam felt compelled to emphasise time and again that upon the film's release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger's fate but that the script wasn't changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{his young}} age (18 years) and the <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> bloody {{way in which}} he reached power, Manuel II of Portugal {{obtained}} an initial sympathy from the public. The young king began his rule by nominating a consensus government presided by admiral Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. This government of pacification, as it became known, despite achieving a temporary calm, only lasted for a short amount of time. The political situation degraded again quickly, leading to having seven different governments in the space of two years. The monarchical parties rose against each other once more and fragmented into splinter groups, while the Republican Party continued to gain ground. In the election of 5 April 1908, the last legislative elections to occur during the monarchy, seven members were elected to parliament, among which were Estêvão de Vasconcelos, Feio Terenas and Manuel de Brito Camacho. In the election of 28 August 1910 the party had a resounding success, electing 14 members to parliament, 10 for Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} books of L'Art poétique, {{the first and}} last consist of general precepts, inculcating mainly the great rule of bon sens; the second treats of the pastoral, the elegy, the ode, the epigram and satire; and the third of <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> epic poetry. Though the rules laid down are of value, their {{tendency}} is rather to hamper and render too mechanical the efforts of poetry. Boileau himself, a great, though, by no means infallible critic in verse, cannot be considered a great poet. He rendered the utmost service in destroying the exaggerated reputations of the mediocrities of his time, but his judgment was sometimes at fault. The Lutrin, a mock heroic poem, of which four cantos appeared in 1674, is sometimes said to have furnished Alexander Pope with a model for the Rape of the Lock, but the English poem is superior in richness of imagination and subtlety of invention. The fifth and sixth cantos, afterwards added by Boileau, rather detract from the beauty of the poem; the last canto in particular is quite unworthy of his genius.|$|E

25|$|The 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 48th {{season of}} FIA Formula One motor racing. It {{featured}} the 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship which commenced on 27 March 1994, and ended on 13 November after sixteen races. The season is remembered {{as one of}} the most <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> controversial seasons in the sport's history. 1994 w{{as one of the}} closest championships in history as Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' title by a single point from Damon Hill after the two controversially collided at the final round in Adelaide. Schumacher had built up a huge championship lead, winning six of the first seven races, before two disqualifications and a race ban allowed Hill to close the gap. British constructor Williams-Renault won the Constructors' Championship. However, the 1994 season will also be remembered for the deaths of three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix. Forty-six drivers competed in the 1994 World Championship, including fourteen who made their F1 debut and numerous pay drivers. Mercedes-Benz also returned to the sport for the first time since 1955 as an engine supplier to Swiss team, Sauber. The season also saw the first win for Ferrari since 1990 – whilst McLaren failed to win a single race following the departure of Senna, before embarking on a long-term partnership with Mercedes.|$|E
25|$|The British {{believed}} that Africaine was wrecked with all {{hands on the}} Charlestown bar. However, the truth was less <b>tragic</b> <b>and</b> more interesting in that it {{gave rise to a}} landmark legal case. The gale had cost Africaine her mizzenmast and 16 men swept overboard, as well as six guns that the crew had thrown overboard to lighten her, but she had reached Charleston bar in the evening of 3 May. It was low tide and although a pilot from Charleston had come aboard, she had to anchor and await high tide so that she could cross. Early on 4 May, the British privateer brig Garland, William Pindar, master, accompanied by a ship, came up and after firing a shot, caused Africaine to strike. Pindar then took Africaine into Charleston as his prize. The French commercial agent in Charlston, Jean Francis Soult, sued to have the vessel freed {{on the grounds that the}} capture had taken place within the territorial waters of the United States, a neutral party. In the case Jean Francis Soult v. Corvette L'Africaine, Judge Thomas Bee of the South Carolina District Court consulted maps and heard testimony, the upshot of which was that Garland had seized Africaine more than one league (three nautical miles or 3.452 miles) offshore, and hence outside U.S. territorial waters. The case established that territorial waters were to be measured from the low-tide line from the shore, with shoals completely under water not counting for the determination of shore or coast.|$|E
