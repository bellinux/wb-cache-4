The Beast {{releases}} her to save Maurice, giving her <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> remember him with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> the townsfolk. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to kill the Beast ("The Mob Song"). With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1917, {{while still}} {{completing}} his military training, Johnson married Eunice Nichols. Their only child, a daughter named Judith, was born May 19, 1927. Upon {{his return from}} military service, Johnson purchased the Elizabethtown Mirror with financial assistance from his father. He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up, and a competitor soon bought him out for a profit. Johnson used the profit {{from the sale of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>to</b> continue his education at the University of Kentucky. While a student, he worked as a reporter for the Lexington Herald. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922. The university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E

5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> <b>to</b> consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information he looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses paths with him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> save her. The androids {{give up and}} shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E

25|$|Also {{reminiscent}} of the Raphael painting are the positioning {{of the head and}} torso, unusual among Rembrandt's painted self-portraits. When painting himself, Rembrandt generally used the more convenient arrangement for a right-handed artist, placing <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> the left of the easel, so as not to have his view impeded by his working arm and hand, with {{the left side of the}} face most prominently featured. There are several frontal self-portraits, but Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar is one of only two, along with Self-Portrait as Zeuxis, that Rembrandt painted in which he is turned to the left, thus revealing more of the right side of his face. It has been suggested that this difference in angle was an intentional variation from the series of self-portraits he was painting at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{boys are}} still trapped in 1867, Fergus is still {{busy in the}} gold fields, and Daniel tries {{to find a way}} to help Constance.

Aunt Lily {{continues}} to lie to Doug and Jenny about where the boys are. Lily tells Daniel she will only realign the mirror if he helps her steal the crown, Daniel pretend to go along with the plan. Later on, when she sees Daniel with the crown she moves the mirror back. She goes through <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> snatch the crown from Daniel, they struggle, and Constance and Daniel are sent through the mirror, leaving Lily behind. They then realise the mirror has cracked in several places.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and saying only negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E

500|$|... "Change Your Life" [...] is a mid-tempo pop power ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 21 seconds. Having {{elements}} of soul and urban contemporary music, its Instrumentation includes tumbling R piano lines and a pulsating, driving backbeat. The song begins with an emotionally frayed spoken-word introduction by Leigh-Anne Pinnock, [...] "She captures her reflection then she throws <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>to</b> the floor/ Her image is distorted, screaming 'Is it worth it anymore?" [...] 4Music said that the spoken-word introduction is reminiscent of All Saints' 1997 single, [...] "Never Ever". The chorus, [...] "Change, change your life, take it all/We gonna stick together, know we get through it all", is pledged by the group in harmony over a spiralling piano lines, cascading keyboard lines and rousing, chugging strings. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Little Mix's vocal range in the song span from the note of A3 to E5. Written in the key of A major, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute.|$|E
50|$|A further array-based switch engine uses {{an array}} of {{individual}} reflective MEMS <b>mirrors</b> <b>to</b> perform <b>the</b> necessary beam steering (Figure 5 (to be uploaded).
