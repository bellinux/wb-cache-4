[...] Nilsen had previously performed there as a backing singer for Jens Carelius. [...] The festival features four stages, and during Nilsen's opening song, [...] "Ta meg med" [...] (<b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you),</b> {{it was possible to}} hear the soundcheck of the black metal band, Nekromantheon, but Nilsen seemed unaffected. [...] Among concert reviews, Nilsen was described by one writer as [...] "a fascinating hybrid of melancholy, vulnerable sweetness and inner strength..." [...] This was Nilsen's first concert since the Rockefeller in March 2012, and since giving birth to a daughter two months previous. [...] Commenting on the most recent phase of her life, Nilsen said, [...] "Now I've also got a million new things to write about, there's so much I want to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|From mid-March {{to early}} May 2004 Sodastream {{undertook}} their first US tour, with further tours of Europe (in May) and Australia (in August). In October {{of the following}} year they released another EP, <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>with</b> <b>You</b> When You Go; the seven tracks had been recorded from March to July by Cohen and Smith. Eliza Sarlos at Mess+Noise enthused [...] "at once calming and intriguing, where the interplay between acoustic guitar, double bass and voice is immediately affecting ... they've still got the songs, the killer songs ... have taken more risks, {{and in terms of}} expression ... narratives flourish with a development in both structure and music".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Shepherdess, <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and I will be wicked no more, but {{serve you}} as of old," [...] shrilled {{the voice of}} Soa in so despairing a cry that the rocks rang.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better fall back at once," [...] Frank answered. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> {{to the edge of}} the {{clearing}} yesterday I saw that preparations had been made for the defense, and that there were white troops there. You will never carry the village. The English have thrown up breastworks of earth, and they will lie behind these and shoot down your men as they come out of the forest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I love you, mamma, {{and that it}} kills me to be sent away from you. <b>You</b> will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> home <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now;--will you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} they did!" [...] cried Codfish quickly. [...] "If you'll <b>take</b> <b>me</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and see that I get to Timminsport safely, I'll tell you where your things are." ...|$|R
60|$|Ind. Oh stay; or <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> {{when you}} go; There's nothing now worth living for below.|$|E
60|$|ISABEL. Why didn't you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> Where rats can go, mice can. I wouldn't {{have come}} back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beaucourt's {{voice broke}} the silence. 'Ministering Spirit!' he said, 'free {{me from the}} life of earth. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to the life eternal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} pretty, but it shuts one in!" [...] she cried. [...] "You feel {{you want to}} get out and can't! I suppose you really couldn't <b>take</b> <b>me</b> back <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to Canada?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kilmeny," [...] he said, seriously, [...] "I {{am going}} to ask you to do {{something}} for me. I want <b>you</b> to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> home <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and introduce <b>me</b> to your uncle and aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} there's any chance, anyway, of my getting over in time now," [...] he remarked. [...] "If you'll <b>take</b> <b>me</b> on <b>with</b> <b>you</b> {{as far as}} Norwich, I can go quietly home from there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> {{will you}} not, Messer Francisco? You {{will never be}} so hard hearted as to go away and leave me behind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fisc. To {{have his}} blood is not amiss, so far I go with you; but <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> further for the means: First, what's the injury? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just his old way!' cried Chuffey, {{looking up}} into his face. 'I almost believe it's Mr Chuzzlewit alive again. Yes! <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you!</b> Stay, though, stay.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Doen't ye, dearest Dan'l, doen't ye!' cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently. 'Take <b>me</b> 'long <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Dan'l, <b>take</b> <b>me</b> 'long <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and Em'ly! I'll be your servant, {{constant}} and trew. If there's slaves in them parts where you're a-going, I'll be bound {{to you for}} one, and happy, but doen't ye leave me behind, Dan'l, that's a deary dear!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child, it's {{perfectly}} simple. This earl {{of yours}} {{has taken the}} thing off to his castle, like a brigand. You say you are going down there on Friday for a visit. All {{you have to do}} is to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and sit back and watch me get busy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That shall I," [...] the lad said. [...] "Could <b>you</b> not <b>take</b> <b>me</b> down <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> young master? You {{could teach}} me there how to comport myself as your squire, {{so that when}} the time comes that you need one, I should know my duties. Besides, you could {{practise}} on <b>me</b> <b>with</b> sword and battle-axe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, don't say that. Only <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I {{will try}} to bear it, if you don't think it right; {{but it will be}} very hard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would {{sometimes}} <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> as you used to," [...] said the boy curiously. [...] "I'm bigger now, and wouldn't be in your way." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear papa, {{you told}} me to tell you {{whenever}} I was miserable. I do not feel well, and I wish to get home. Do <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Didst thou ever {{awake and}} find thy mother gone?" [...] asked Hester. [...] "Not that I remember," [...] said the child. [...] "If thou fearest {{to leave me}} in our cottage, thou mightest <b>take</b> <b>me</b> along <b>with</b> <b>thee.</b> I would very gladly go! But, mother, tell me now! Is there such a Black Man? And didst thou ever meet him? And is this his mark?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Maimie,' he cried, 'it isn't fair to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if <b>you</b> {{think you}} can go back! Your mother'--he gulped again--'you don't know {{them as well as}} I do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's all right,' Miss Sperrit pronounced. 'Take Mrs. Sidney back <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Rhoda, {{and put her}} to bed. I'll <b>take</b> Jimmy <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> aren't {{afraid of}} the water now, are you, Jimmy?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. Will you <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to {{the shores}} of the great salt lake?" [...] said Kambira, in a low, pathetic tone, [...] "will you make me your servant, your slave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have found}} it! You {{have found the}} way out!" [...] screamed An-Tak. [...] "Oh, Luata! And now I am too weak to go. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you!</b> Take me with you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{you like}} do now, eh? P'r'aps wish {{fly back to}} Town of Child, for suppose this how you come. If so, please <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> because that save long ride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Maimie," [...] he cried, [...] "it isn't fair to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if <b>you</b> {{think you}} can go back. Your mother"--he gulped again--"you don't know {{them as well as}} I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't!" [...] shrieked Joel, wagging {{his head}} in spent passion. [...] "An' you ain't a-goin' to take thet girl home.... I'll <b>take</b> her <b>with</b> <b>me....</b> An' <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the hosses home!" ...|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. Neither shall I be able {{to steal}} George's wife. I have {{stretched}} out my hand for that forbidden fruit before; and I know that my hand will always come back empty. To disbelieve in marriage is easy: to love a married woman is easy; but to betray a comrade, to be disloyal to a host, to break the covenant of bread and salt, is impossible. <b>You</b> may <b>take</b> <b>me</b> home <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Polly: {{you have nothing to}} fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Arnold--dear Arnold," [...] she sobbed, [...] "you {{are going}} into the storm--and I want to go! I want to go, too! My hands are cold, and my heart. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> dear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would ask}} this, {{that if it}} pleases you, you will buy me of the cacique my master, or command him to give me up to you, and <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to Tenoctitlan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Francis Hammond, Messer Pisani. I had the honour {{of seeing}} {{you at the}} house of my patron, Signor Polani, and you were good enough to offer to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, live, Septimius," [...] {{said the}} girl, whose face {{appeared}} to grow bright and joyous, {{as if the}} drink of death exhilarated her like an intoxicating fluid. [...] "I would not let you have it, not one drop. But to think," [...] and here she laughed, [...] "what a penance,--what months of wearisome labor thou hast had,--and what thoughts, what dreams, and how I laughed in my sleeve at them all the time! Ha, ha, ha! Then thou didst plan out future ages, and talk poetry and prose to me. Did I not take it very demurely, and answer thee in the same style? and so thou didst love me, and kindly didst wish to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> in thy immortality. O Septimius, I should have liked it well! Yes, latterly, only, I knew how the case stood. Oh, how I surrounded <b>thee</b> <b>with</b> dreams, and instead of giving thee immortal life, so kneaded up the little life allotted <b>thee</b> <b>with</b> dreams and vaporing stuff, that thou didst not really live even that. Ah, it was a pleasant pastime, and pleasant is now the end of it. Kiss me, thou poor Septimius, one kiss!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she loved}} him all the more, and saidâ€”â€˜Fair youth, you are too bold; but I can help you, weak as I am. I {{will give you a}} sword, and <b>with</b> that perhaps <b>you</b> may slay the beast; and a clue of thread, and by that, perhaps, you may find your way out again. Only promise me that if you escape safe <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> home <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to Greece; for my father will surely kill me, if he knows what I have done.â€™ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we will nave no more ceremony, but be kin and playmates as {{in other}} times; for I am done with the great wars now, and you two will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> home <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and I shall see--" [...] She stopped, {{and for a moment}} her happy face sobered, as if a doubt or a presentiment had flitted through her mind; then it cleared again, and she said, with a passionate yearning, [...] "Oh, if the day were but come and we could start!" ...|$|R
