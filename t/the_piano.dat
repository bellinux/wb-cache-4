5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. <b>The</b> <b>piano</b> pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> <b>The</b> <b>piano</b> pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|He {{also wrote}} three concertos: <b>the</b> <b>Piano</b> Concerto (1936), the Violin Concerto (1940), and the Cello Concerto (1946).|$|E
50|$|Strings and two pianos: the {{introduction}} begins with <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> playing a bold tremolo, {{under which the}} strings enter with a stately theme. <b>The</b> <b>pianos</b> play a pair of scales going in opposite directions to conclude {{the first part of}} <b>the</b> movement. <b>The</b> <b>pianos</b> then introduce a march theme that they carry through {{most of the rest of}} {{the introduction}}. The strings provide the melody, with <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> occasionally taking low runs of octaves which suggest the roar of a lion, or high ostinatos. The two groups of instruments switch places, with <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> playing a higher, softer version of the melody. The movement ends with a fortissimo note from all the instruments used in this movement.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{interlocking}} <b>piano</b> rhythm themes occur throughout <b>the</b> piece. <b>The</b> <b>pianos</b> interlock, creating <b>the</b> {{effect of}} constant eighth-note chords.|$|R
50|$|Ten old pianos, reconditioned, {{elaborated}} by street-artists {{and positioned}} in a strategic {{location in the}} town, play an original suite composed with spatial effects and choreographies involving the pianists. One of <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> is free: everybody can sit down and play, improvising on {{the sounds of the}} suite. The score is fitted for an ensemble of piano students and teachers and includes parts with difficulties from amateur to expert. If possible, a famous pianist gets involved as tutor of <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> ensemble. Out of the performances, everybody can enjoy <b>the</b> <b>pianos.</b>|$|R

5|$|The first {{competition}} {{was held in}} 2001. Most of the twelve winners were from Asia, with Chinese Mengla Huang topping the violin category and the Italian Giuseppe Andaloro taking first prize in <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> section. In the second tournament in 2004, the competition received a more worldwide range of winners; contestants coming from Asia, Europe and North America finished in the prize winning places. Japanese Saeka Matsuyama won the violin part in the final and Xiaotang Tan from China came in first place in <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> category. In the 2007 finals, which contained five Russian contestants, the violin section was topped by Russian Alena Baeva while in <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> category the Japanese Yuya Tsuda came first. The 2010 violin {{competition was}} won by the German/South Korean Clara-Jumi Kang, while Vadym Kholodenko of Ukraine won <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> competition. As of 2013 there have been five competitions with the next to be contested in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The All-Steinway School {{designation}} {{is given}} by Steinway to educational institutions of music in which not less than 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> are designed by Steinway. Steinway does not offer <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> free of charge but requires that the institutions buy them. Performance venues, teaching studios, and practice rooms for piano students must be equipped with Steinway pianos. Teaching studios and practice rooms for other students may be equipped with Boston or Essex pianos; some All-Steinway Schools have chosen to have Steinway pianos in these rooms also. It is required that <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> are kept in performance-quality condition and All-Steinway Schools must have piano technicians that participate in Steinway's technical training programs. If <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> are not maintained in performance-quality condition, Steinway can withdraw the All-Steinway School designation.|$|R

50|$|Although {{most of the}} {{scholarly}} focus on differences in <b>pianos</b> covers <b>the</b> Classical era, {{it is also true}} that even in the Romantic era - and later - <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> for which <b>the</b> great composers wrote were not the same as <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> that are generally used today in performing their music.|$|R
50|$|The third {{movement}} is a rondo-like dance, starting and finishing in C major. <b>The</b> <b>pianos</b> introduce <b>the</b> movement, {{followed by the}} xylophone. At {{the end of the}} work the last notes of <b>the</b> <b>pianos</b> die away, there is a concluding duet for snare drum and cymbal, and the sonata ends extremely quietly.|$|R

5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well and examples are now hard to find.|$|E

In covering <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> release, Slate editor Chris Wilson wrote that <b>the</b> AvantGrand <b>piano</b> represents a substantial functional improvement over <b>the</b> conventional <b>piano,</b> while sounding practically indistinguishable from one for 95% of the world's pianists.|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, the {{instrument}} enjoyed a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining {{the rights to}} <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, {{the instrument}} has since been reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and the winds. Mozart probably wrote <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E

5000|$|Hammond - Hammond pianos {{and players}} were an {{outgrowth}} of <b>the</b> Hammond <b>Piano</b> Co., organized in Hammond, Indiana, in 1904, by James F. Broderick. <b>The</b> Straube <b>Piano</b> Company held a controlling interest in the company. The objective was to produce medium grade pianos, with comparable quality, at lower prices than the premium Straubes. <b>The</b> Hammond <b>Piano</b> Co. launched its first two pianos in 1905, Style 21 and Style 23, both full uprights. Hammond pianos {{were made in the}} same factory as Straube and Gilmore <b>pianos,</b> but <b>the</b> Hammond <b>Piano</b> Co. business was kept separate. <b>The</b> Hammond <b>Piano</b> Co. was originally chartered in 1903 Illinois as <b>the</b> Chicago Electric <b>Piano</b> Co. by <b>the</b> Straube <b>Piano</b> Company. <b>The</b> incorporators were James T. Broderick, E. R. Jacobson and W. G. Martin, all of <b>the</b> Straube <b>Piano</b> Co. <b>The</b> purpose was to market a nickel-in-the-slot piano player known in the East as the Autoelectra. The name-change to Hammond Piano Co. was filed in Indiana in February 1905.|$|R
