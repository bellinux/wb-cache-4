500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{found the}} band moving {{farther away from}} their metal roots. Renkse stated that the music was still rooted in metal in a vague sense, but that the band had {{moved away from the}} sound in favor of {{something}} that [...] "their parents would listen to", with more of a mature sound. Feeling that prior albums, especially Discouraged Ones had too many songs that sounded too similar to one another, Renkse stated that the band aimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> each song have a stronger individuality as its [...] "own chapter or sound". American progressive metal band Tool and its album Aenima was a strong influence on the album. William York of AllMusic described the album's sound as [...] "depressing, heavy alternative rock with a notable Cure influence" [...] but that [...] "Katatonia is not really playing metal anymore here". The album features entirely clean vocals of Renkse, frequently overdubbed, along with thick distorted guitar parts and hard-hitting drum sound. The track [...] "We Will Bury You" [...] contains electronic elements replacing the drum parts. This was initially done because Liljekvist was living out of the city {{at the time of the}} city, and had already left when Nystrom had finished writing it. Due to the limited time in the studio, and generally short length of the track, a drum machine was used to replicate the sound, something the band felt helped contribute to the album's diversity without completely changing the band's sound.|$|E

How can they have use for so much as they seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have?</b> They’ve got to work it off. Well, they work it off on you. There are lots of them that take you to board and teach you. My second cousin—that young lady I told you about—she got in with a crowd like that, and they posted her right up in three months. They just took her right in and let her have it—the full force. That’s what they do to you; they set you right down and they talk at you. You’ve got to understand them or perish—so you strike out in self-defence; you can’t help yourself. That family my cousin was with has moved away somewhere, or I should try and get in with them. They were real live people, that family; after she left my cousin corresponded with them in French. You’ve got to do that too, to make much real head.
