5|$|<b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> took on {{many forms}} during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work well in a musical, but that many of the other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|The season {{continued}} {{to focus on}} the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance the challenges of their competitive careers with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E
50|$|The plot, in essence, tells <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{of several}} teens in a school. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> are {{designed}} to affect pre-teen minds: The orphan Braulio, Diana at her boarding school, and Connie and her parents winning the lottery, {{to name just a}} few.|$|R
50|$|Nashville Musician Paul Burch, Earley's {{neighbor}} at the time, {{was asked}} to write an album based on <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> and characters in the book. The album, Last of My Kind, was released by Merge Records in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel was}} adapted into the 1955 Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical Pipe Dream, which was {{nominated}} for nine Tony Awards. The movie version of the book's predecessor, Cannery Row, incorporates several of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>lines</b> in Sweet Thursday.|$|R
5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have major effects on <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|In {{yet another}} {{alternate}} timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns {{that she is}} {{still in love with}} her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line,</b> Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks of hysteria and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Diamond and Pearl are {{role-playing}} {{games with}} adventure elements. The basic {{mechanics of the}} games are largely {{the same as their}} predecessors. As with all Pokémon games for handheld consoles, gameplay is in third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his or her party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with no Pokémon or Poké Balls, but is given the choice of three Pokémon as a part of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line.</b> Once Pokéballs are obtained, the player can capture more Pokémon using Pokéballs. The player can also use his/her Pokémon to do damage to the other Pokémon. Whenever the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last not an option in battles against trainers). All Pokémon have hit points (HP); whenever a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless revived at a Pokémon center or with an item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it can level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon whenever they reach a certain level. Pokémon's stats also increase every time it levels up, and they will also learn new moves as well. If the player cancels an evolution the Pokémon will learn new moves faster.|$|E

5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line,</b> {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran natively on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> of the {{attraction}} {{is more complex}} than that of its American and European counterparts. The scenario involves the adventures of the hotel's famous builder and owner, Harrison Hightower III (modeled after Walt Disney Imagineering executive Joe Rohde), who went on many expeditions throughout the world and collected thousands of priceless artifacts. Most of these artifacts were stolen for personal gain and stored in his hotel. After one such expedition to Africa, he brought home an idol with the name of Shiriki Utundu.|$|E
25|$|Immersion of the {{visitors}} into <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> has no equivalent to the high-tech beaming on board the Enterprise-D used in the Klingon Encounter.

With the on-screen participation of Trek series cast members Kate Mulgrew and Robert Picardo, and numerous actors in realistic makeup and utilizing well designed props and sets, the threat of assimilation by the Borg seems palpable. The plot involves the participants in several close encounters with Borg drones.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{and racial}} issues are {{represented}} in Dreamgirls being a black-cast musical with three female lead roles. Being set in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement was influential on <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> with black artists starting {{to succeed in the}} music industry and black music becoming accessible to all audiences, which is a representation of racial boundaries being broken down. The story is based on three women working their way up in the music industry to achieve their dreams while the most powerful people in the industry are men. In the end, the women stand up for their rights and become influential figures.|$|E
25|$|Peary {{returned}} the favor in a memorable 1944 Fibber McGee & Molly episode in which {{neither of the}} title characters appeared: Jim Jordan was recovering from a bout of pneumonia (this would be written into the show the following week, when the Jordans returned), and <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> involved Gildersleeve and nephew Leroy hoping to visit the McGees at home during a train layover in Wistful Vista, but finding Fibber and Molly not at home.

25|$|The {{stories in}} the Buffy comics take place in between episodes of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series, and {{continue}} after the series ended. Issues 1 to 63 take place during the period that the series was still on air, and none are written by Joss Whedon himself. The earlier issues are not very easy to place in the series other than the season they are set in. The stories get more specific later on, however; for example, the Oz Buffy comics fill in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>line</b> of Oz's character after he leaves the TV series, and the Death of Buffy comics clearly take place between Seasons 5 and 6 of the series.|$|E
