In addition, even after controlling for these, there are differences in the performance and nature of trading decisions of these two groups.

Benzoin was studied because of its intersting management, and very little data was available on present exploitation. Benzoin is the resin of various species of Styrax trees (Styracaceae). In Sumatra Benzoin resin from Styrax tonkensis is called kemenyan in Maly and haminjon in Batak. It is chiefly used for incense, perfume and medicine.

The Indonesian consumption, which is possible {{the highest in the world}} at the moment, is the most likely to decrease, as using benzoin in rituals is now perceived as backward.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on interactions, price convergence and co-movements among the organized (and parallel) {{markets in the}} Czech Republic. Significant and lasting price differences between the individual <b>trading</b> <b>channels</b> available to the investor are documented and they are attributed to the (inefficient) institutional structure of the Czech capital markets as these characteristics are not sensitive to the firms' characteristics. The central markets of the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) and the RMS (over-the-counter system) represent the two most closely linked market channels. The interrelations between these markets are studied to identify the leaders and followers in the information transmission process. The analysis shows the leading position in actively traded stocks to be held by the PSE main market, but RMS dominates in segments with lower liquidity. The analysis of the intramarket relations also confirms that liquid segments play {{a leading role in}} both the PSE and RMS. Given the unpleasant evolution of the Czech capital markets and contrary to the theory, these links actually weaken over time as a smaller fraction of total trade is being transacted on these price-forming markets. Thus, we conclude that the PSE and the RMS do not behave as a fully integrated and efficient market. Major institutional changes are identified as the only mitigating force which has led to the deteriorating position and reputation of the Czech capital markets and the Prague Stock Exchange in particular. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of excess global {{liquidity}} on a small open economy with vertical trade in a stochastic general equilibrium sticky price model. When a small open economy is characterized by vertical trade, then excess global liquidity may generate a contractionary effect on the economy. This is because excess global liquidity causes not only {{a reduction in the}} world interests rate but also global inflation, particularly, sharp increases in the price of commodities or raw materials, which inevitably cause a contraction in the economy from the intermediate goods trade. We develop a simple analytical two-sector sticky price model to show that {{the effects of}} global liquidity shocks through the vertical <b>trade</b> <b>channel</b> depend critically on the structure of vertical trade and the exchange rate policy regime. Furthermore, we show that, in a general infinite-period two-sector model, the dynamic effects of global liquidity through the vertical <b>trade</b> <b>channel</b> also depend on the degree of financial integration of the economy {{with the rest of the}} world. Finally, we find that the quantitative global liquidity spillover effects from vertical <b>trade</b> <b>channel</b> are larger than those from the interest rate channel...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2009 spread through different channels from its {{origin in the}} United States to {{large parts of the}} world. In this paper we explore the financial and the <b>trade</b> <b>channels</b> in a unified framework and quantify their relative importance for this transmission. Specifically, we employ a DSGE model of an open economy with an internationally operating banking sector. We investigate the transmission of the crisis via the collapse of export demand and through losses in the value of cross-border asset holdings. Calibrated to German and UK data, the model attributes around half of the observed maximum output decline in Germany to these channels, and 87 % for the UK. While the <b>trade</b> <b>channel</b> explains 30 % of the empirical output decline in both countries, the financial channel plays a much larger role in the UK than in Germany. The UK's larger vulnerability to financial shocks is due to higher foreign-asset holdings, which simultaneously serve as an automatic stabilizer in case of plummeting foreign demand. The transmission via the financial channel triggers a much longer-lasting recession relative to the <b>trade</b> <b>channel,</b> resulting in larger cumulated output losses and a prolonged crisis particularly in the UK. Stricter bank capital regulations would have deepened the initial slump while simultaneously speeding up the recovery...|$|R
