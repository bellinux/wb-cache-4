In this paper, we evaluate approaches {{to determine how}} much of <b>the</b> observed <b>linkage</b> evidence, namely <b>the</b> identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing at <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak, is explained by associated SNPs. We study several methods: Homozygote Sharing Tests (HST), Genotype Identity-by-Descent Sharing Test (GIST), and a permutation approach. We also propose a new approach, HSTMLB, combining HST and the Maximum Likelihood Binomial (MLB) linkage statistic. These methods can identify SNPs partially explaining <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak, but only HST and HSTMLB can identify SNPs that do not fully explain <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> evidence and be applied to multiple-SNPs. We contrast these methods with the association tests implemented in the software LAMP. In our simulations, GIST is more powerful at finding SNPs that partially explain <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak, while HST and HSTMLB are equally powerful at identifying SNPs that do not fully explain <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak. When applied to the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium data, HST and HSTMLB identify marker pairs that may fully explain <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak on chromosome 6. In conclusion, HST and HSTMLB provide simple and flexible tools to identify SNPs that explain the IBD sharing at <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> peak...|$|R

As literary scholar Murray Krieger states [...] "Shakespeare {{is not likely to}} overlook the possibilities of metaphorical extension". The idea of that state is held highly in this sonnet, [...] "primarily it functions in the majestic world of sovereignty, the summit of political hierarchy". The poet, however, realizes the fragility of the state as even the state is [...] "subject to Time's love or to Time's hate" [...] (124.3). The English state during Shakespeare's life was ruled by Queen Elizabeth, who was regarded as high in virtue, intelligence and status. However, throughout Europe political assassinations ruled the continent and Elizabeth was not alone. She continually evaded numerous attempts at her life. The Sonnet extends out from the state as a political feature to [...] "envelop the contingencies of the human condition, the generic 'accident' of line 5".

2500|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} [...] of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. [...] Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. [...] A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. <b>The</b> <b>linkages</b> in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.|$|E
