25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. This new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, {{this is not just a}} minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E

2500|$|A second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> {{produces}} ultraviolet {{but does}} not have the filter material, so it produces more visible light and has a blue color when operating. [...] These tubes are made for use in [...] "bug zapper" [...] insect traps, and are identified by the industry designation [...] "BL".|$|E
2500|$|ACL PARs, whose {{light beam}} is more compact, have a nominal {{operating}} voltage of 28V. [...] ACL PAR is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> used in aviation, before being used on stage for light path effects. In the UK, ACL pars are typically used together with four mounted {{together on a}} bar, and two bars run in series together {{in order to work}} on a dimmer with 240 V supply voltage.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> has a violet filter material, {{either on}} the bulb or in a {{separate}} glass filter in the lamp housing, which blocks most visible light and allows through UV, so the lamp has a dim violet glow when operating. [...] Blacklight lamps which have this filter have a lighting industry designation that includes the letters [...] "BLB". [...] This stands for [...] "blacklight blue", which is a contradiction {{in that they are}} the type that does not look blue.|$|E

50|$|During the venous translumination, {{the amount}} of {{reflected}} light depends on the index of refraction which can be altered by the venous thrombosis. Certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> process more dispersion than reflection, and therefore favor the formation of artifacts.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> {{are also}} {{sensitive}} to switching cycles. Rooms with frequent switching such as bathrooms can expect much shorter lamp life {{than what is}} printed on the box. Compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles.|$|R
50|$|The lamp was {{patented}} in 1840 and in 1864 the Belgian {{government made}} this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> compulsory.|$|E

50|$|A Tiffany lamp is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> {{with a glass}} shade {{made with}} glass {{designed}} by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his design studio. The most famous was the stained leaded glass lamp. Tiffany lamps are {{considered part of the}} Art Nouveau movement.|$|E
5000|$|LED lights - These {{are more}} recent developments, using the 'Super Bright' LED technology, and are {{entering}} wide use {{as they are}} easy to fit (being only a few millimetres wide, rather than several centimetres for most strobes and incandescent lights). This makes them particularly suitable for covert use. Though currently much more expensive than other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps,</b> there are substantial benefits. They draw much less electric current than other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> which is a valuable reduction in electrical load on these vehicles' over-stressed electrical systems. They are much more resistant to vibration and have much longer service lives. They also present very saturated colors and so enhance visibility during daylight hours.|$|R
5000|$|It {{may be just}} {{an opening}} in the body <b>of</b> the <b>lamp,</b> or an {{elongated}} nozzle. In some specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps,</b> there is a groove on the superior aspect of the nozzle that runs along to the pouring hole to re-collect the oozing oil from the wick.|$|R
50|$|Like HMI, HQI lamps are {{a subset}} (or <b>type)</b> <b>of</b> metal halide <b>lamps,</b> which in turn {{are a subset}} of high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) lamps. They {{should not be confused}} with quartz halogen lamps, which are a specialized <b>type</b> <b>of</b> incandescent <b>lamp.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of under-cabinet {{lighting}} available for residential use in the USA: incandescent, fluorescent, or LED. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> dictates the lamp’s style and performance, such as amount of lighting it emits, the light’s color, {{the life of the}} lamp, and energy use.|$|E
50|$|A {{germicidal}} lamp {{is a special}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> which produces ultraviolet (UVC) light. This short-wave ultraviolet light disrupts DNA base pairing causing formation of pyrimidine dimers and leads to the inactivation of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. It {{can also be used}} to produce ozone for water disinfection.|$|E
5000|$|A second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> {{produces}} ultraviolet {{but does}} not have the filter material, so it produces more visible light and has a blue color when operating.

50|$|One {{advantage}} of Stephenson's design over Davy's {{was that if}} the proportion of firedamp became too high, his lamp would be extinguished, whereas Davy's lamp could become dangerously hot. This was illustrated in the Oaks colliery at Barnsley on 20 August 1857 where both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> were in use.|$|R
40|$|Trawling {{and light}} fishing with {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> for light attraction {{were carried out}} at Vizhinjam. One Species of cuttlefish and two species of squids formed part of the trawl catches while three species of squids were obtained in light fishing. The biological characteristics of these cephalopods are briefly dealt with...|$|R
50|$|Another, major {{departure}} from the VL1 and VL2, {{was the use of}} a custom-made, tungsten lamp as the light source, which ran at a maximum of 53 volts and consumed 475 Watts. This was dimmed by a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> power supply—the IPS, with I standing for Induction, instead of Arc.|$|E
5000|$|LB211 GvR 1935 Pattern -In {{response}} to {{criticism of the}} narrow aperture of the original Lamp box a larger model was cast with the aperture enlarged to 5½ inches by 1 inch. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lamp</b> box was in use from 1935 to 1949 when it was replaced with the modern 1940s pattern.|$|E
50|$|A {{sealed beam}} is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> with a {{parabolic}} reflector, {{one or more}} filaments, and a glass or polycarbonate lens sealed permanently together as a unit. Originally introduced for road vehicle headlamp service, sealed beams have since been applied elsewhere. Halogen sealed beam lamps incorporate a halogen lamp within a quartz or hard glass envelope.|$|E

50|$|Xenon arc lamp: this is {{the most}} common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> both for {{continuous}} and flashed solar simulators. These lamps offer high intensities and an unfiltered spectrum which matches reasonably well to sunlight. However, the Xe spectrum is also characterized by many undesirable sharp atomic transitional peaks, making the spectrum less desirable for some spectrally sensitive applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{blowtorch}} is {{of ancient}} origin {{and was used}} as a tool by gold and silversmiths. They began literally as a [...] "blown lamp", a wick oil lamp with a mouth-blown tube alongside the flame. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp,</b> with spirit fuel, continued to be in use for such small tasks into the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamp</b> {{was very}} widely used by railways, {{both on the}} front and rear of trains and for hand signals, due to its reliability. At a time when there were few {{competing}} light sources at night outside major towns, the limited brightness of these lamps was adequate and could be seen at sufficient distance to serve as a warning or signal.|$|E
50|$|Garden {{lighting}} can be {{an important}} aspect of garden design. In most cases, various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, {{it is more important to}} determine the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism.|$|R
