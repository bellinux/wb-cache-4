5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their lives. For in 1275, <b>the</b> <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to <b>the</b> <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took {{possession}} of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296).
