40|$|This edited {{volume on}} Identities at Work brings {{together}} international theory and empirical research {{that deals with}} continuity and change of identity formation processes at work under conditions of modern working processes and labour market flexibility. Modern work processes in manufacturing and service organisations increasingly rely upon responsible and competent employees who are {{willing and able to}} engage in the tasks that their job requires and in continuous learning. That employees are able to engage in taking up new forms of responsibility and master complex work situations is, on the one hand, dependent upon employees’ skills and how well they are trained. On the other hand, it requires that employees identify with what they do and commit to their work and the performance of tasks. By bringing together perspectives from sociology, psychology, organisational management and vocational education and training the contributions in this volume connect the debates of skills formation, human resources development and careers with individual’s work commitment and professional orientations in various ways. With this focus the volume presents a new research perspective based on an interdisciplinary and international approach. We argue that in times of globalisation and rapidly changing work realities such an approach is needed to better understand and analyse what is required to equip and prepare the workforce to meet international labour market demands. In this sense <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>shall</b> serve as a useful resource to researchers and policy makers working in the fields of skills formation, human resources development and organisational management...|$|R

At the first stage, the approximate age is calculated using a decision function f_ 0 (x [...]) defined {{on the basis of}} a regression constructed based on the training set G^l across the whole range of ages (y_,y_). At the second stage, this value is refined by means of a decision function f_d (x) generated {{on the basis of a}} regression constructed for a specific age group d that includes the value of age estimated at the first stage.

40|$|The authors {{present the}} results of high {{intensity}} beam propagation experiments conducted with the Nova laser system to investigate the occurrence of stimulated rotational Raman scattering (SRRS) from atmospheric nitrogen in the beam path. Enclosed is a preprint entitled ''Stimulated Rotational Raman Scattering in Nitrogen in Long Air Paths'' that they have published in the November issue of Optics Letters. The physics issues associated with SRRS are discussed at length in the preprint. The small signal steady-state SRRS gain coefficient that they determined from threshold measurements is in excellent agreement with recent direct SRRS gain measurements by Bischel, et al., at SRI, and is in good agreement with early gain estimates from Averbakh, et al., in the Soviet Union. Consequently, they have {{a high degree of}} confidence in the gain coefficient. In addition, threshold SRRS experiments on the long air-path Nova II system are in substantial agreement with the earlier Nova experiments. Nova and Nova II system performance limitations were not critically addressed in <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> so they <b>shall</b> discuss these issues in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Documents, {{have been}} the most {{prolific}} writers {{on the subject of the}} distribution of U. S. government publications in recent years. As Buckley has had the opportunity of expressing his views on the subject in his paper in this issue of Library Trends, a summary of Brock‘s thinking along these lines will be given here. In his recent article “Implementing the Depository Law,”l Brock discusses certain deficiencies of the Federal Depository Library Act of I 962 (Public Law 87 - 579), and proposes a substitute program which he feels would avoid most of the problems, would cost less, and would achieve the essential objectives of the law. The following requirements, he feels, are unsatisfactory: Sec. 1. Government publications, except those determined by their issuing components to be required for official use only or those required for strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no public interest or educational value and publications classified for reasons of national security, shall be made available to depository libraries through the facilities of the Superintendent of Documents for public information. Sec. 5. Upon request of the Superintendent of Documents, the components of the Government which order <b>the</b> printing of <b>publications</b> <b>shall</b> either increase or decrease the number of copies of publications furnished for distribution to designated depository libraries and State libraries so that the number of copies delivered to the Superintendent of Documents shall be equal to the number of libraries on the list [...] The Superintendent of Documents shall currently inform the components of the Government which order <b>the</b> printing of <b>publication...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to present the}} synthetic picture of the Church, which has emerged in the Polish papers of the 20 th and 21 st century. It aims at answering questions: How has {{the image of the}} Church changed in the papers, depending on the historical epoch and socio-political situation, and to what extent was it connected with them? How diverse was the image of the Church at one time, regarding press titles which mentioned it, their program line, an editor, etc. ? What are the possible specific dimensions and subjects of the potential studies in this area? It needs to be stipulated already in the introduction that <b>the</b> submitted <b>publication</b> <b>shall</b> not encompass <b>the</b> detailed analysis of the changing image of the Church in the papers in the discussed time period. It is impossible; such a detailed analysis must have been included in numerous monographs of sizable length. It is rather aimed at arranging already conducted research in this field, presenting some long-term processes and the main change factors, which occur in the aforementioned image as well as factors, which shaped it. The additional goal – as already indicated – can be providing an inspiration for the more specific research in this area. Before the author would proceed to explore the formulated subject, he would present the preliminary concepts, i. e., he would briefly discuss the specificity of understanding the Church nature in terms of a divine-human institution, the very concept of the media image and the possible ways of its examination. The situation of the Polish press in a given epoch as well as the historical background would be analyzed together with the conducted study. In the last chapter describing the situation after 1989, the object of the analysis also considers other media and it is due to the increasingly universal phenomenon of convergence and also ownership and capital links between the particular media concerns.
