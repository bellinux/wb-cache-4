25|$|The four-hour {{round trip}} to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails is {{considered}} moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit is usually harsher than below, year round; winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening. Winter snow and ice can linger on the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The compacting of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen {{the time it takes}} for the snow and ice <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off.</b> Stabilizers, crampons, ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents depending on ice and snow cover. Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are few reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hiking hazards. Poison ivy does not grow on Mount Monadnock, and venomous snakes do not inhabit it. The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.|$|E
500|$|The film {{appeared}} in It Came from Hollywood, a 1982 comedy film featuring {{a compilation of}} clips from more than 100 B movies from the 1930s to the 1970s, which are shown between scripted segments performed by comedians. Baker's effects from The Incredible Melting Man inspired the makeup effects for a scene in the science fiction-action film RoboCop (1987). During the scene, Emil Antonowsky (Paul McCrane) attempts to drive RoboCop off the road, but instead accidentally drives into a vat of toxic waste, causing the flesh <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off</b> his face and hands. These effects were conceived and designed by special makeup effects artist Rob Bottin, who was inspired by Baker's work on The Incredible Melting Man and dubbed the RoboCop effects [...] "the Melting Man" [...] as an homage to the production.|$|E

60|$|The {{mountains}} {{are very high}} and steep about Carson, Eagle and Washoe Valleys--very high and very steep, and so when the snow gets <b>to</b> <b>melting</b> <b>off</b> fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and soften, the disastrous land-slides commence. The reader cannot know what a land-slide is, unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole {{side of a mountain}} taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the valley, leaving a vast, treeless, unsightly scar upon the mountain's front to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he may go on living within seventy miles of that place.|$|R
50|$|Jun (Wade-Giles : chün) ware {{was a third}} {{style of}} {{porcelain}} used at the Northern Song court. Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun {{is covered with a}} turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that it almost seems <b>to</b> be <b>melting</b> <b>off</b> its substantial golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted, their shape is much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at the court of Emperor Huizong. Jun production was centered at Jun-tai in Yuzhou, Henan Province.|$|R
50|$|As objects grow hotter, they glow red {{proportionate}} {{to their}} heat energy. Laser fire is scalable; lower-powered lasers {{are likely to}} gradually warm an object and cause it <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> and boil <b>off.</b> High-powered lasers {{are more likely to}} flash-boil the voxels they strike, resulting in a hole in the object and relatively little heat transferred to the surrounding material.|$|R

[...] Peristere was concerned that that effect would be too graphic for television. He shot Doyle in his demon form, and Doyle with half-burned make-up then used mat elements to digitally [...] "chew through his skin", including an element of acetone poured on Styrofoam.|$|E
50|$|Aleksei Sytsevich was a thug {{who worked}} for Eastern Bloc {{scientists}}. The scientists subjected him to a process which gave him an artificial skin covering which granted him superhuman strength. After being empowered, Aleksei Sytsevich rebels against the agents who gave him his powers and destroys their laboratory. He is subsequently hired to kidnap Colonel John Jameson {{in order to obtain}} extraterrestrial spores to which Jameson has been exposed during a space mission. Jameson is rescued and the Rhino defeated by the superhero Spider-Man. The Rhino is imprisoned and kept there with sedation but soon breaks out and continues to try to kidnap Jameson. Spider-Man uses a web imbued with a chemical developed by Curt Connors <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off</b> his Rhino hide and then knocks him unconscious.|$|E
50|$|In {{chocolate}} making, the Broma process (not to {{be confused}} with the Dutch Process), is a method of extracting white cocoa butter from roasted cocoa beans. The Broma process consists of hanging bags of roasted cocoa beans in a very warm room and allowing the cocoa butter, which melts at slightly above room temperature, <b>to</b> <b>melt,</b> drip <b>off</b> the beans, and be collected. The Dutch Process differs from the Broma process in that, after the cocoa butter has been drained off the beans as described above, the beans are then soaked in an alkaline solution to make them chemically neutral.|$|R

5000|$|... "Kickapoo Joy Juice" [...] was {{a fictional}} {{beverage}} coined in the American comic strip Li'l Abner. [...] Al Capp, the cartoonist, described the beverage as [...] "a liquor of such stupefying potency that the hardiest citizens of Dogpatch, {{after the first}} burning sip, rose into the air, stiff as frozen codfish". It {{was said to be}} an elixir of such power that the fumes alone have been known <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> the rivets <b>off</b> battleships.|$|R

50|$|Quad Flat Package (QFP) chips have thin leads closely packed {{together}} {{protruding from}} the four sides of the integrated circuit (IC); usually a square IC. Removal of these chips can be problematic as {{it is impossible to}} heat all of the leads at once with a standard soldering iron. It is possible to remove them {{with the use of a}} razor blade or a high-rpm craft tool, simply by cutting off the leads. The stubs are then easy <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off</b> and clean with a soldering iron. Obviously this technique entails the destruction of the IC. Another method is to use a heat gun or pencil butane torch and heat up a corner, and gently pry it off, working the torch down the leads. This method often leads to traces getting lifted off the PCB where a lead did not get heated enough to cause the solder to flow.|$|E
5000|$|Bowel control {{can vary}} from patient to patient. The {{combination}} of no food, very little fluids, {{and a lot of}} prescription drugs has the potential to cause many patients to become constipated. The body is used to a normal diet, and used to excreting waste in a system. Interrupting the system can cause bowel problems. This constipation can be resolved in a couple of ways. The first way, and the most common way, is to administer a rectal suppository. A rectal suppository is administered through the anus, and into the rectum. They are bullet-shaped and contain medicine that will help the patient's bowels get back on track. Once the suppository is inserted, it is designed <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off</b> the wax-like case, and put the medicine in the body. [...] If the suppository does not work, a laxative may be continued at home to keep the bowels in full function.|$|E

The first thing that really caught me about Gesso’s debut full-length Howling Grace was the absolutely gnarled, distorted, fuzzy bass that crunched and trundled about, propelling the guitar work and tight drums into the stratosphere. The chest rumbling thunder of four-string sonic assault is aided by tight distorted guitar leads that thread {{in and out of the}} songs like a needle in some cosmic fabric of space and time, all interlocked with the perfectly apt drumming, occasional saxophone appearance and enough trippy space sounds to keep you floating out of body and mind the whole time. Theres some pretty great acid jazz and space rock going on here, amidst dead ahead instrumental psych rock and some nice mid-tempo melodies that will have you slow-motion head banging within seconds. Gesso truly is the real deal." [...] ("Its Psychedelic Baby" [...] Magazine) ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} uses for flame {{cleaning}} {{rather than just}} to remove rust and mill scale. It is also used as a removal tool for paints, bad welds, burrs, mechanical wear (scraping, cuts, gouges and more) along with other surface imperfections.The process of flame cleaning is not anything new and does not require any extra equipment than what would {{be found in a}} typical metal shop. It is just an oxygen-fuel torch that is used parallel with the surface <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> and blow <b>off</b> any blemishes that the operator wants to eliminate. Shown in the adjacent diagram, the surface is blasted with the oxygen-fuel torch across the surface versus the orthodox use of the flame as a cutting or gouging tool. Though the equipment is the same, the flame used in cleaning is drastically reduced to prevent excess removal of the surface. Various kinds of fuel can be run with the oxygen, for example acetylene.|$|R

Almost immediately afterwards, Zeeshan's X-Gene activates, and Hope and the Lights begin to head towards Zeeshan, whose skin has started <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> <b>off</b> of his body. One of Zeeshan's friends takes pictures and videos of Zeeshan and posts them online, quickly getting thousands of hits. Greatly saddened, Zeeshan takes a steak knife into the bathroom to kill himself.

5000|$|The clearly frightened boys {{make plans}} to move far away and {{advertise}} for someone {{to go with them}} and share the travel expenses. The person involved is actually Butch's girlfriend (Mae Busch). Butch soon manages to escape by leaping from a train, and makes his way to his girlfriend's apartment, where Stan and Ollie ring the bell. Butch hides in a large trunk, thinking it's the cops at the door; the trunk gets locked and Butch can't get out. The boys do their best to get him out, not realizing who the trapped person really is. After several inept attempts at freeing him, Butch notices (and recognizes) Ollie through a bored hole. His suggestion of using a blowtorch <b>to</b> <b>melt</b> the lock <b>off</b> backfires as Butch is set on fire. The boys hose Butch down and he frees himself from the trunk, taking his promised revenge on them as the cops arrive shortly afterwards. The film ends with Stan and Ollie sitting on the couch, both with their legs snapped off and tied around their necks. Then Ollie said his [...] "another nice mess…" [...] catchphrase to Stan.
