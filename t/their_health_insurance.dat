25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> This reduces {{the flexibility of the}} labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.|$|E

Workers with employer-sponsored insurance also contribute; in 2007, the average percentage of premium paid by covered workers is 16% for single coverage and 28% for family coverage.

500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get <b>their</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense (DOD) has increased its reliance on its National Guard and reserve forces to support the Global War on Terrorism, and particularly Operation Iraqi Freedom. Congress has been interested in making improvements and enhancements to compensation and benefit programs for reserve component members. When reserve component members are activated for more than 30 days under federal authorities, they are covered under TRICARE, DOD's health care system. While reserve component members are automatically covered by TRICARE when activated, their spouses and other dependents {{have the option of}} using either TRICARE or <b>their</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> However, our prior work found that dependents of reserve component members who had dropped <b>their</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reported problems accessing the TRICARE system [...] such as difficulty finding a health care provider, establishing eligibility, understanding TRICARE benefits, and knowing where to go when questions and problems arise. In addition, maintaining continuity of care with the same health care providers, especially for dependents with chronic medical conditions, may be problematic after switching to TRICARE. To address these concerns, some legislative proposals would give reserve component members the option of accepting a stipend from DOD to help defray the cost of continuing <b>their</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> for <b>their</b> spouses and dependents when they are activated for more than 30 days. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 requires us to determine the cost and feasibility of providing a stipend to members of the Ready Reserve to offset the cost of continuing <b>their</b> current private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage for <b>their</b> dependents while they are on active duty. Specifically, we (1) examined whether the implementation of a health care stipend program would be likely to increase or decrease the cost to DOD of providing health care to the spouses and dependents of reserve component members and (2) identified the potential implications of a stipend program on members and their families, DOD, and the members' employers. ...|$|R
