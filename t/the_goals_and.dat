São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E

The prosecution witnesses testified about <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin.

5|$|The playoff {{campaign}} was a high-scoring one, with there being {{an average of}} 4⅔ goals per game in the three matches played. The semi-final was against Lincoln City, and was played over two legs. The first leg at the Memorial Stadium was won 2–1 by Rovers, thanks to goals by Craig Disley and Richard Walker. The second leg was played at Sincil Bank and ended 5–3, with Stuart Campbell, Rickie Lambert, Richard Walker, Sammy Igoe and Sean Rigg scoring the goals. This gave Rovers a 7–4 aggregate win and {{a place in the}} final at Wembley Stadium.

40|$|Remanufacturing is an {{important}} strategy in the manufacturing industry. A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{is often used to}} measure whether, and to what extent, a remanufactured product is ‘better’ for the environment than a newly produced equivalent. In order to obtain valid and meaningful outcomes, LCA standards and guidelines need to be followed. However, for the system boundaries selection in the LCA for remanufacturing the standards and guidelines offer insufficient guidance to practitioners. This paper reports on a literature review conducted to analyze how {{the first step in the}} LCA, i. e., <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>and</b> scope definition stage, is shaped in prior LCAs for remanufactured products. The review suggests that <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>and</b> scope definitions are often shrouded in obscurity in prior LCAs for remanufactured products. Moreover, different perspectives that shape <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>and</b> scope definitions are identified and their meanings and assumptions analyzed. An illustrative case study of a real-life remanufactured product demonstrates how different perspectives in <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>and</b> scope definition stage lead to different LCA models and different LCA outcomes. The paper concludes with several recommendations on how to shape the LCA for remanufactured products...|$|R

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> purposes of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
