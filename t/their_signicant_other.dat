40|$|Background/Objective:There is {{increasing}} evidence that positive life changes,such as post-traumatic growth (PTG),can {{result from the}} experience of coping with cancer. However,no interventions have been specically designed to facilitate the development of PTG in cancer. In this article,we describe and assess the results of Positive Psychotherapy for Cancer (PPC) survivors. It aims to facilitate PTG as a way of achieving signicant reductions in the symptoms of emotional distress and posttraumatic stress. In addition,the corroboration of this PTG facilitation is assessed using interpersonal indicators. Method: We allocated 126 consecutive survivors of cancer with high levels of emotional distress and who were seeking psychological support to either an experimental group (PPC) or a waiting list group. Results: The PPC group obtained signicantly better results after treatment than the control group,showing reduced distress, decreased posttraumatic symptoms, and increased PTG. The benets were maintained at 3 and 12 months' follow-up. Participants' PTG was correlated to the PTG that their significant others attributed to them, corroborating PTG facilitation. Conclusions: PPC appears to promote signicant long-term PTG and can reduce emotional distress and posttraumatic stress in cancer survivors. In addition,PTG facilitation induced by PPC is corroborated by <b>signicant</b> <b>others...</b>|$|R

DIGE's accuracy and precision, however, is compromised by the existence of <b>other</b> <b>signicant</b> sources of systematic variation, including that caused by the apparatus used for imaging proteins (location of the camera and lighting units, background material, imperfections within that material, etc.).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a simulation framework which {{we use to}} numerically evaluate the Hybrid DEA - Second Score Auction. In a procurement setting, {{the winner of the}} Hybrid auction by design receives payment at the most equal to the second score auction. It is therefore superior to the traditional second score scheme {{from the point of view}} of a principal interested in acquiring an item at the minimum price without losing in quality. For a set of parameters we quantify the size of the improvements. We show in particular that the improvement depends intimately on the regularity imposed on the underlying cost function. In the least structured case of a variable returns to scale technology, the hybrid auction only improved the outcome for a small percentage of cases. However, for those few cases the improvement introduced by the hybrid auction is <b>signicant.</b> For <b>other</b> technologies with constant returns to scale, the gains are considerably higher and payments are lowered in a large percentage of cases. In the simulations, we furthermore calculate the eect of the number of the participating agents, the concavity of the principal value functions, and the number of quality dimensions. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Werner Heisenberg (1901 - 1976) is {{probably}} {{best known for his}} discovery of the uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics and their physical interpretation (1927). En route to quantum mechanics itself, he had earlier had the decisive insight that quantum-mechanical variables do not commute (1925). This formed the basis for the creation of matrix mechanics immediately afterwards by Born and Jordan, appearing in mature form in the `Dreim 7 ̆fannerarbeit' with Heisenberg. 2 This was one of the two paths along which modern quantum mechanics was discovered. Some of his other achievements in theoretical physics deserve to be mentioned. Barely 20, and well before the introduction of electron spin, Heisenberg made the revolutionary proposal to allow half-integral quantum numbers {{in the context of the}} Zeeman eect (1921). He made various <b>other</b> <b>signicant</b> contributions in the period 1920 - 1925 that led to the establishment of quantum mechanics, and once the ne...|$|R
40|$|The {{curse of}} {{dimensionality}} is severe when modeling high-dimensional discrete data: {{the number of}} possible combinations of the variables explodes exponentially. In this {{paper we propose a}} new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow at most as the square of the number of variables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables (thus reducing signicantly the number of parameters). Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically <b>signicant</b> improvements over <b>other</b> methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that large {{tropical}} forests are the home of an enormous biodiversity with a variety of applications in modern biotechnology. However, the exploration of a forest tract bears similarities with <b>other</b> <b>signicant</b> enterprises, being a risky and costly project. Recently, the Brazilian government has passed a law qualifying the controlled cession of forest tracts for scientic research with a view to uncover new compounds or the development of innovative products. Major questions are: how to design a proper mechanism to grant these temporary concessions? which hedge structure will be offered to the prospectors and the government as well? This paper is a rst attempt to answer these questions, {{with the aid of a}} real options model. We restrict ourselves, for simplication, to the case of one discovery, modelled according to Poisson arrivals. General Itô diffusions are allowed whenever possible, as in the case of the current costs during the prospection period.

40|$|Magnesium (Mg) based {{materials}} are {{now some of}} the most promising materials for hydrogen storage due to their light weight and high hydrogen capacity. <b>Their</b> most <b>signi?cant</b> limitation, however, is the high de-hydrogenation temperature and low kinetics. Niobium (Nb) has been proposed for improving the hydrogen sorption kinetics in Mg thin ?lms. In this work, Mg/Nb multi-layered thin ?lms were investigated by theoretical methods and compared to experimental results. Some selected properties such as structural, elastic, energetic and electronic charge properties of the bulk and thin ?lms have been investigated. Firstly, classical thermodynamic models and ?rst-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) were used for describing the pseudomorphic growth in Mg/Nb multi-layered ?lms observed in experiments. Calculations of the thermodynamic, electronic and structural stability of a body-centered cubic (bcc) Mg show that this structure is in fact metastable under thin ?lm conditions, when Mg grows epitaxially on the bcc Nb, in agreement with experiments. The predicted bi-phase diagram of Mg/Nb multilayers indicated that not only the metastable bcc Mg can be stabilized, but also a hexagonal close packed (hcp) Nb can be stabilized under the speci?c range of the bilayer thickness and the volume fractions of the constituents. Next, the hydrogen desorption properties of the free standing Mg ?lms and Mg/Nb multilayers were elucidated by DFT calculations. The computational tools were used for assisting the experimental characterization. As a result, two metastable orthorhombic magnesium hydrides (Os-MgH_(2) and Om ?MgH_(2)) were observed in those ?lms. Due to the in?uence of stress and corresponding formation of these metastable phases, signi?cant destabilization of MgH 2 provides ultra-low hydrogen desorption temperature in both free-standing Mg and multilayer Mg/Nb ?lms. Formation of enthalpies (?Hf) and estimating desorption temperatures (Td) were determined by DFT calculations and indicated that either tension or compression will lead to destabilization of MgH_(2). Moreover the hydrogen di?usion mechanisms were studied in both bulk and thin ?lm structures. The site preference and di?usion activation energy calculations successfully describe hydrogen sorption behavior in Mg/Nb multilayers in experiments. It is expected that the results of this research will foster further work {{on the development of the}} solid-state hydrogen storage systems necessary to bring the hydrogen economy closer to reality...|$|R
40|$|Identifying -risk" {{students}} - {{those that}} {{are in danger of}} failing or not completing a course - is a crucial element in enabling students to achieve their full potential. However, with large class sizes and growing academic workloads, it is becoming increasingly dicult to identify students who require urgent and timely assistance. Ecient and easy to use tools are needed to assist academics in locating these students at early stages within <b>their</b> courses. A <b>signicant</b> body of work exists in the use of student activity data, e. g. attendance, performance, participation in faceto- face and online sessions, to predict overall student performance and at-risk status. This is often built upon the considerable amount of student data within learning management systems. Manual data collection, including surveys and observation, which introduces additional workload is often required to extract relevant data meaning that it in large classes it is prohibitively dicult to apply such techniques. In this paper, we introduce a framework for atrisk identication combining simple metrics, gathered from social network and statistical analysis domains, that have been shown to correlate with student performance and require slow amounts of manual data collection or additional expert analysis. We describe each of the metrics within our framework and demonstrate their usage. We use visualisation to enable easy interpretation of results. The application of our framework is demonstrated within the context of an advanced undergraduate computer science course. Thomas Haig, Katrina Falkner, Nickolas Falkner[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Due to a {{previous}} lack of suitable sources and detectors, terahertz (1012 Hz) frequencies {{have proven to}} be historically inaccessible relative to the neighbouring microwave and infrared regions, where electronic and optical techniques respectively dominate. In recent years, however, the Gap 2 ̆ 2 has been closing due to a number of novel and interesting technologies. This has sparked interest in a number of industrial and scientic applications where terahertz frequencies have <b>signicant</b> advantages over <b>other</b> frequencies. In this thesis, I will focus on the generation and detection of terahertz-frequency pulses using short pulses of infrared light, using a co-ordinated system of generation and detection known as time-domain spectroscopy (TDS). With TDS, one may obtain a time-resolved electric eld measurement with sub-picosecond resolution. The fourier transform of the time-resolved signal yields both phase and amplitude spectral information over a wide spectral range simultaneously this may be used to investigate the frequency dependence of the complex permittivity of a given sample and observe absorption lines in the terahertz region. Several emission mechanisms will be discussed, such as photoconductive (PC) emission, transient current (TC) emission, and optical rectication (OR) emission. These mechanisms are often present simultaneously and {{it may be necessary to}} analyse several experimental parameters to separate out the various contributions. Along with the investigation of multiple candidate emitters, I present a completely general theory for the geometry of optical rectication in semiconductor crystals of 43 m symmetry, that is, the zinc-blende class comprising III-V and II-VI semiconductors such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium phosphide (InP), zinc telluride (ZnTe) and others...|$|R
