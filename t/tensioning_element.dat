40|$|Abstract: Hybrid {{composite}} <b>tensioned</b> <b>element</b> on {{the base}} of steel and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) with strengthened sections was considered as an object of investigation. Strengthening of the most heavy loaded cable's sections is necessary to decrease the difference between maximum and minimum axial forces in the cable, which depends on the deflection. Strengthening of the cable's sections was carried out by the increase of volumetric fraction of steel in some sections by the length. The behaviours of <b>tensioned</b> hybrid composite <b>element</b> with strengthened sections were investigated analytically and by experiment. The hybrid composite <b>tensioned</b> <b>element</b> with strengthened sections was considered as a material of cable net of prestressed saddle-shaped cable roof 50 x 50 m in plan, together with the steel cables. It was stated, that the using of the <b>tensioned</b> hybrid composite <b>element</b> with strengthened sections enables to decrease consumption of cable net materials...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{structural}} performance of long and slender tensegrity booms. Previous {{studies show that}} tensegrity structures are generally more flexible than conventional trusses or space frames. The aims here were (i) to quantify how much more flexible eleven different tensegrity booms are, when compared to state-of-the-art truss booms, (ii) to find a general explanation for this. The performance criterion used for the comparison was the first natural frequency of the boom. A finite element program with truss elements was used to compute the natural frequencies around the initial prestressed configurations. The results show that tensegrity booms have between one and three orders of magnitude lower natural frequencies than truss booms. It is concluded that for the best performing tensegrity booms, the bending stiffness is independent {{of the level of}} pre-stress and the number of infinitesimal mechanisms as the bending stiffness is given mainly by the material stiffness of the <b>tension</b> <b>elements</b> and not the geometric stiffness as the infinitesimal mechanisms are not activated by bending. Thus, whereas the level of pre-stress and the presence of infinitesimal mechanisms play major roles for the stiffness of some tensegrity structures, the axial stiffness and orientation of <b>tension</b> <b>elements</b> are most important for the studied slender booms...|$|R

50|$|Buttress {{roots are}} large roots {{on all sides}} of a shallowly rooted tree. Typically, they are found in nutrient-poor {{rainforest}} soils and do not penetrate to deeper layers. They prevent the tree from falling over (hence the name buttress) while also gathering more nutrients. Buttresses are <b>tension</b> <b>elements,</b> being larger on the side away from the stress of asymmetrical canopies. The roots may interwind with buttress roots from other trees and create an intricate mesh, which may help support trees surrounding it. They can grow up to 30 ft tall and spread for 30 metres above the soil then for another 30 metres below. When the roots spread horizontally, they are able to cover a wider area for collecting nutrients. They stay near the upper soil layer because all the main nutrients are found there.|$|R

Bismuth enhanced the ductility of the alloy by a factor of two and elastic-plastic fracture toughness to 9 MPa m– 1 / 2 from a value of almost zero. The improved ductility of bismuth modified alloy is attributed to the reduced interconnectivity of the eutectic suicide, absence of significant suicide precipitation in the eutectic region and increase in the volume fraction of uniformly distributed dendrites. These changes are accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of eutectic solidification...|$|R

5000|$|A Pratt truss {{includes}} vertical {{members and}} diagonals that slope down towards the center, {{the opposite of}} the Howe truss. The interior diagonals are under tension under balanced loading and vertical elements under compression. If pure <b>tension</b> <b>elements</b> are used in the diagonals (such as eyebars) then crossing elements may be needed near the center to accept concentrated live loads as they traverse the span. It can be subdivided, creating Y- and K-shaped patterns. The Pratt truss was invented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt. [...] This truss is practical for use with spans up to 250 ft and was a common configuration for railroad bridges as truss bridges moved from wood to metal. They are statically determinate bridges, which lend themselves well to long spans. They were common in the United States between 1844 and the early 20th century.|$|R
30|$|Then {{these forces}} are {{imposed on the}} shear wall and the frame and, subsequently, moments are {{determined}} {{at the end of}} the structural elements. If these moments are distributed in the structural elements such as shear walls and frames with regard of their corresponding flexural stiffnesses [(EI/h) or (EI/l)], then the approximate values of the actual end moments can be obtained. It is worth stating that if the shear walls are significantly different, or if there are great variations in the shear wall areas at each floor level, then the above calculation method can lead to false results. In this case, it is necessary to consider an idealized structure with more than one shear wall connected to the frame by means of <b>tension</b> <b>elements,</b> and the stiffness of each one must be calculated separately. Then the stiffness of the idealized structure can be calculated by summation of the distinct stiffnesses.|$|R

We optimize a background structure connecting each node of the discrete model of the structure with all the neighbors lying inside a sphere of prescribed radius, in order to determine a minimal mass resisting structure under the given loading conditions and prescribed yielding constraints. Fiber-reinforced composite reinforcements can be naturally replaced by any other reinforcements that are strong in tension (e. g., timber or steel beams/ties).

This design features high energy efficiency and low-power actuation, and it has enabled the development of hopping robots that carry all power on-board.

The defect retention of AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel, in relation to comparable austenitic grades, means that conventional mechanical scale-breaking techniques such as shot-blasting can leave unacceptable levels of damage in the metal surface. Although this can often be masked by high apparent surface quality in the intermediate sheet, final forming can reveal serious defects. Division of the aspects of roll-breaking into bend and <b>tension</b> <b>elements</b> led to two areas of laboratory investigation. Bend tests showed the effects of strain on both convex and concave surfaces, and suggested a mechanism for oxide failure. Tension tests illustrated that the failure mechanisms apply over the same range of strain, regardless of the loading state.
