500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that {{he comes from a}} theater background, and that [...] "being able to comment on the show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement is just that she knows that they're getting so many details wrong, but she always regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to.

[...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E

His exact words were: It's so strong you wouldn't believe now. We have the Israelis coming to us for equipment. We say we can't possibly get the Congress to support that. They say, 'Don't worry about the Congress. We will take care of the Congress.' Now <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> from another country, but they can do it.

30|$|Moreover, {{from the}} {{responses}} {{it seemed that}} one’s culture assigns roles to its members; when individuals experience a trauma these social and cultural roles (e.g. I am a father/provider/caregiver) undergo change that can result in loss or damage to the self. For instance, individuals “don’t say I’ve lost my role but men [as an example] … {{one way or another}} you’re led to a thought that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who had a place in the family, a place in society, erm, had a role who now doesn’t. So you know, going from provider and head of the family to being the one who is looked after because … he’s traumatized” (PB). Thus when the self is thought of in terms of failure, or rather failing in its role, it can have very negative connotations, individuals “think of themselves as very weak and not very strong to face these problems [resultant from the trauma event]” (P 6).|$|E

5000|$|Grace Coddington, Sassoon's former {{model and}} {{creative}} director of American Vogue, said that he changed the way the public looked at hair: [...] Before Sassoon, it was all back-combing and lacquer; {{the whole thing was}} to make it high and artificial. Suddenly you could put your fingers through your hair! He didn’t create five-point cut for me; he created it on me. It was an extraordinary cut; no one has bettered it since. And it liberated everyone. You could just sort of drip-dry it and shake it. [...] John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon [...] "was the creator of sensual hair. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> who changed our industry entirely, not just {{from the point of view}} of cutting hair but actually turning it into a business. He was one of the first who had a product line bought out by a major corporation".|$|R
5000|$|The book Going Bovine {{addresses}} themes including heroism, {{the definition}} of reality, the transformation from child to adult, and the influences of love and death on our lives. Bray comments on the novel, saying it’s “about poking a little fun at modern life and pop culture." [...] Also commented on in <b>this</b> novel <b>are</b> the ideals of American materialism, modern education, and religious cults. The main theme, however, is, as Bray says about her book, {{how is it that}} “we know we’re living our lives, or if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>somebody’s</b> dream?”. Bray also comments that in the book, “comedy and tragedy are {{two sides of the same}} coin." [...] It also contains many scenes where the idea of keeping promises and not leaving friends in times of need is expressed. A theme that is shown most often through Cameron is that, Bray says, “culture tries to negate aggression and unhappy feelings," [...] and Bovine talks about the expression of those feelings.|$|R

50|$|The term Shiva Sharanas/Sarana can {{be roughly}} {{explained}} as devotees of Lord Shiva. The 12th century Vachanakaras are also known by <b>this</b> name. Sharana <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> who has surrendered oneself {{to the will}} of the Lord. Sharanu <b>is</b> derived from <b>this</b> term and it denotes the action of surrendering to or an act of respecting others. <b>This</b> term <b>is</b> seen in many Vachanas composed by the Vachanakaras namely Basavanna, Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi and Madivala Machideva. The Vachanakaras, surrendering themselves {{to the will of}} Lord Shiva, have glorified and praised the forms of Lord Shiva. Not only this, the term signifies profound philosophical meanings. A sharana is given a prime place in the schematic world of Vachanas. An example for elevated position of a sharana is the following vachana of Basavanna.|$|R
