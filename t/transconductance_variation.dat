40|$|A simple {{technique}} for stabilising the transconductance of CMOS transconductors against temperature variations, with {{no need of}} external frequency reference signals, is presented. Accurate electrical simulations demonstrated that a 2. 6 % maximum <b>transconductance</b> <b>variation</b> over the temperature range 55 – 150 C and a 600 % tuning range can be obtaine...|$|E
40|$|We {{showed the}} {{different}} effects of uniform gate stress and CHC stress. CHC induced strong subthreshold swing degradation and a negligible <b>transconductance</b> <b>variation.</b> On the contrary, the uniform gate stress induced a smaller subthreshold swing variation, but a considerably larger gm variation. This different behavior {{is due to}} the different location of the stress damage. CHC strongly affects the region near the source which marginally plays a role in the channel conduction in the linear region, whereas the uniform stress affects the whole channel area...|$|E

Threshold voltage {{and channel}} transconductance variations correlate {{with the growth}} of the interface state density. The spectral density of the stress induced interface states in the Si bandgap does not depend upon the anneal gas but the transistor lifetime (for a 20 % <b>transconductance</b> <b>variation)</b> is {approximately} 40 times shorter for H{sub 2 } as opposed to D{sub 2 } annealed devices...|$|E
40|$|A rail to rail {{input common}} mode range is an {{important}} requirement in operational amplifiers for some applications. The most common method for implementing full range operation is by using a complementary differential pair. It is simply a compound structure that consists of NMOS and PMOS differential pairs connected in parallel. The compound structure achieves rail to rail operation; however, it produces <b>variations</b> in the <b>transconductance</b> over the input common mode range. The variations obstruct the design of an optimal operational amplifier. This paper discusses sources and solutions for the <b>transconductance</b> <b>variations.</b> Several reported approaches {{to solve the problem}} will be evaluated. They reduce the variations to 5 - 28 % depending on the technique and method of implementation used. This is a significant improvement over 100 % variations we get from complementary differential pair without utilizing any constant gm technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Robustness of InAlN/GaN devices under proton {{radiation}} is investigated. Several proton fluences ranging from 1 × 1014 to 4 × 1014 {{have been considered}} on two typologies of devices. Displacement damage {{is found to be}} the major responsible of device DC degradation leading to threshold voltage positive shift, ON resistance increase and drain current decrease, in all cases well correlated with proton fluence. Negligible difference is noticed in displacement damage effects measured on different device typologies. Furthermore, device geometry does not influence the impact of proton radiation on main DC parameters, either if gate width or length are considered. Radiation significantly affects trapping properties. A good correlation between the so-called current collapse increase and proton fluence is demonstrated when a high gate drain voltage value is imposed as trapping condition. Moreover radiation enhances the contribution of dynamic ON resistance and <b>transconductance</b> peak <b>variation</b> on current collapse increase. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A CMOS op-amp {{input and}} gain stage {{suitable}} for low voltage operation are introduced. The input stage operates in strong inversion and has common-mode range beyond rail-to-rail. It uses two complementary differential pairs connected in parallel. The common-mode dependent current biasing employs only four transistors, {{does not require}} additional voltage references, current switches and/or current mirrors and does not increase the minimum required supply voltage. The variation of the net transconductance is approximately 15 % over the entire common-mode range. The gain-stage has constant output resistance. In addition it reduces the variation of the net <b>transconductance</b> due to <b>variations</b> in μn/μp ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} characterization, {{in terms}} of drain current, of SLS ELA p-channel polysilicon TFTs is investigated. The study {{was based on the}} DLTS technique. It was found that drain current is governed by trapping/detrapping mechanisms associated to poly-Si/SiO 2 interface states. This fact is in accordance with the results of stretched exponential analysis applied on switch-ON drain current transients. DC hot carrier measurements under worse ageing condition regime were also conducted. Threshold voltage and <b>transconductance</b> <b>variation</b> revealed that hole injection towards the gate oxide is the prevailing mechanism, while poly-Si/SiO 2 interface degradation seems to be minor. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} core electrical parameters and transport characteristics of a flexible version of fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) with sub- 20 -nm wide fins and high-k/metal gate-stacks. For the first time, we characterize them from room to high temperature (150 °C) to show the impact of temperature variation on drain current, gate leakage current, and <b>transconductance.</b> <b>Variation</b> of extracted parameters, such as low-field mobility, subthreshold swing, threshold voltage, and ON-OFF current characteristics, is reported too. Direct comparison is made to a rigid version of the SOI FinFETs. The mobility degradation with temperature is mainly caused by phonon scattering mechanism.

Most of the ADCs have a pre-ampliﬁer implemented for driving the large input capacitance of the ADC or amplifying the weak naturally occurred input signals. One of the key factors in designing a pre-ampliﬁer is its signal to noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) as the noise and distortion introduced by the pre-ampliﬁer might degrade the eﬀective number of bits (ENOB) of ADC. This work introduces a high gain, high bandwidth, wide input common mode range (ICMR), and highly linear fully diﬀerential folded cascode pre-ampliﬁer for a 14 -bit analog to digital converter. The system uses native n-channel transistors as diﬀerential input pair to achieve a wide ICMR with minimum <b>transconductance</b> <b>variation.</b> The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the pre-ampliﬁer is minimized over diﬀerent process corners. A process corner conﬁgurable class AB output stage is implemented to provide a railtorailoutputsignal. Additionally, aprocesscornerconﬁgurablecompensationcircuit is implemented to ensure the stability of system over diﬀerent process corners. The preampliﬁer achieves a closed-loop gain of 130 dB, a unity gain bandwidth of 200 MHz, a THD of− 92. 2 dB, and a phase margin of 68 ◦. The pre-ampliﬁer is designed using TSMC 180 nm CMOS technology.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Ted Higman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 108 pages. One {{of the most}} important building blocks in modern IC design is the operational amplifier. For the portable electrocardiogram (ECG), the operational amplifier is employed to sense and amplify the electrical signal of heartbeat of human body. For the battery powered portable ECG system, low supply voltage environments are required to reduce power consumption and the result is a reduced input common mode range (ICMR) of the op-amp. To overcome the reduced ICMR problem, complementary differential pairs operated in parallel are commonly used to achieve a rail-to-rail input common mode range. However, this complementary differential input pair structure can have a substantial <b>transconductance</b> (gm) <b>variation</b> problem and a dead zone problem in a low supply voltage environment and an extremely low supply voltage environment respectively. In the past years, a number of techniques have been proposed to overcome those problems for low- and extremely low-supply voltage environments. This dissertation is focused on an op-amp applicable to a portable ECG system and in total five novel rail-to-rail constant gm op-amps usful for circuits such as a portable ECG are proposed. Three of those op-amps work in the low supply voltage environment and two op-amps are proposed for the extremely low supply voltage environment. Cadence SPECTRE simulation and TSMC 0. 25 -µm CMOS technology are used to simulate and lay out these works...|$|R
