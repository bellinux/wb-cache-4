25|$|Back in Peking, Phillips {{translated}} nursing <b>training</b> <b>material</b> into Chinese. Then, in September 1915, Phillips taught {{medicine in}} Chinese at the Union Medical College for Women. The classes she taught varied from hygiene to public health. Phillips also attended classes with her {{students at the}} Peking Union Medical College to translate the curriculum for them. Phillips also agreed to be the visiting physician for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, but when asked to officially join the mission again, Phillips declined, no longer wishing to affiliate with a specific mission. Phillips also rented a house for herself {{so that she could}} open her own private practice. To make some extra money, Phillips rented out rooms to paying guests. Along with teaching and her medical practice, Phillips was also made the unofficial physician for the YWCA, in which Phillips worked to help Chinese women medically and socially. At age 45 while in Peking, Phillips adopted a boy baby since she could not have children due to her previous hysterectomy. The baby was from England and she named him Clifford. After spending time in China, Clifford returned to England as a young man to continue his education.|$|E
500|$|Purcell {{was hired}} by LucasArts, then known as Lucasfilm Games, as an {{animator}} in 1988, but was subsequently laid off when the project {{he was working on}} was canceled. Despite being laid off, he was rehired to produce art for the graphic adventure game Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. Purcell was later commissioned to create the cover artwork for Maniac Mansion and the first two Monkey Island games and researched into whips for the adventure game version of [...] He worked with animation in several LucasArts adventure games, published three more Sam & Max comic books during this time, and began creating brief comic strips for LucasArts' quarterly newsletter, The Adventurer. The characters eventually became involved as <b>training</b> <b>material</b> for LucasArts programmers working with SCUMM, the core game engine used by LucasArts adventure games; Purcell created versions of Sam and Max in their office for new programmers under Ron Gilbert to practice on. References to the characters were occasionally made in unrelated LucasArts adventure games as a clandestine appearance in backgrounds. Purcell wrote the six-issue comic book series Defenders of Dynatron City for Marvel Comics in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Along with Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, {{also based}} at Williamtown, No.2 OCU {{was under the}} control of No.81 Wing from 1961 until the wing was disbanded in 1966. By late 1963, {{personnel}} were busy developing <b>training</b> <b>material</b> for the pending Sabre replacement, the Dassault Mirage III, a task that required them to translate the manufacturer's technical documentation from the original French. No.2 OCU received its first Mirages in February and March 1964. It commenced conversion courses on the type that October, and fighter combat instructor courses in August 1968. The RAAF eventually took delivery of 100 Mirage IIIO single-seat fighters and 16 Mirage IIID two-seat trainers; No.2 OCU operated both models. Squadron Leader John Newham, later to serve as CAS, held temporary command of the unit from July 1965 to April 1966. A Sabre-equipped aerobatic display team named the [...] "Marksmen" [...] was formed within No.2 OCU during 1966 and 1967. Between 1967 and 1984, six of the unit's Mirages suffered major accidents, resulting in three fatalities. Experience in the Vietnam War led the RAAF to begin training forward air controllers in 1968. The task initially fell to No.2 OCU before a specialised unit, No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight, was formed in 1970. [...] In October 1969, the OCU began operating the Macchi MB-326 jet for lead-in fighter training, as well as the Mirage. No.5 Operational Training Unit, based at Williamtown, took over responsibility for Macchi courses from April 1970 until its disbandment in July the following year; the Macchis were then transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E

The latter said that Hicks could not speak enough Arabic to be understood. Hicks wrote home that he had met Osama bin Laden 20 times. He later, however, told investigators he had exaggerated, that he had seen bin Laden about eight times and spoken to him only once.|$|E

2500|$|The Grescoe article (see Criticism section) did not garner much {{attention}} and the allegations in Michelle Remembers were still {{considered by many}} in the early 1980s to be true. As a result, Pazder was considered to be an expert in the area of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden emergence of Satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s (likely {{due in part to the}} publication of Michelle Remembers) Pazder's expertise was called upon. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial which featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on Satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC’s 20/20. Pazder was part of the Cult Crime Impact Network and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on Satanic ritual abuse cases. By September 1990, Pazder had been consulted [...] "in more than 1,000 'ritual abuse' cases". With people suddenly being prosecuted for satanic ritual abuse, prosecutors used the book as a guide when preparing cases against alleged Satanists. Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases several local social workers had attended a training seminar that listed satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse and used Michelle Remembers as <b>training</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system of}} dichoptic {{presentation}} for binocular vision therapy {{has been proposed}} by researchers of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre. Using a modified puzzle video game Tetris, the interocular suppression of patients with amblyopia was successfully treated with dichotomic training in which certain parameters of the <b>training</b> <b>material</b> were systematically adapted {{during the course of}} four weeks. Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity. Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an eye patch. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards. Dichoptic-based perceptual learning therapy, presented by means of a head-mounted display, is amenable also to amblyopic children, as it improves both the amblyopic eye's visual acuity and the stereo function. The researchers at McGill University have shown that one to three weeks of playing a dichoptic video game for one to two hours on a hand-held device [...] "can improve acuity and restore binocular function, including stereopsis in adults". Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} these effect can be enhanced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).|$|E
