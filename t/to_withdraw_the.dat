5|$|Chinese forces counterattacked, {{destroying}} a 3rd Infantry Division {{tank column}} sent {{to assist the}} Rangers and attacking the 3rd Ranger Company from three sides, as they dug into a hill. Though the Rangers eventually were forced <b>to</b> <b>withdraw,</b> <b>the</b> defense of the Rangers, the US 3rd Division and the British 29th Brigade had broken {{the momentum of the}} Chinese offensive.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} left, meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> <b>The</b> regimental commander, {{told him he}} could not do so until the 7th Cavalry had cleared on its withdrawal road. This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The newer M5000 trams {{proved to}} be {{considerably}} more reliable than the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000's averaged 20,000 miles. This led to a decision in 2012 <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> entire fleet from service {{and replace them with}} M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E
5|$|A ring Roxy {{inherited}} from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat. Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off and Janine is arrested after the ring {{is found in}} her teapot. She is interviewed, but is released {{due to lack of}} evidence. She realises that Peggy planted the ring in an attempt to frame her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she accuses him of only being interested in her for her alibi. He says it is not true, but she drunkenly threatens <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> alibi, and walks to the police station.|$|E
5|$|At 9:30p.m., the Sa'iqa company {{reported}} an Israeli armored column advancing towards the fort. Two Egyptian tanks {{on the west}} bank opened fire, forcing the Israeli tanks and armored vehicles <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> <b>The</b> company continued eastwards, eventually reaching the crossroads, facing no resistance along the way. With the reinforcing anti-tank teams, the company established defensive positions, and el-'Abassi dispatched patrols to secure the roads leading to the fort.|$|E
50|$|When the Greater Western {{franchise}} {{was up for}} reletting in 2005, consideration {{was given}} <b>to</b> <b>withdrawing</b> <b>the</b> service.

[...] Withdrawal will only become effective following {{negotiations on the}} terms of the exit, which are scheduled to last two years.|$|R
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> <b>The</b> fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> entire class.|$|E
5|$|During a Khamsin on 3 November {{while the}} {{bombardment}} of Gaza resumed, the 1/4th Battalion The Essex Regiment (161st Brigade, 54th Division, XXI Corps) attacked and captured Yunis trench at 04:30.

5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{was armed}} with two 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns {{were of a}} new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Horrocks {{visited the}} Polish {{positions}} at Driel {{to see the}} front for himself. Later, he hosted a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg. In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, {{it was decided that}} another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though, it seems Horrocks realised the futility of the situation and plans were drawn up <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> 1st Division.|$|E

The victim later recanted and attempted <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> accusation, though prosecutors presented evidence that she had received a cash payment just before doing so.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, but gave way {{under the pressure}} of Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> <b>The</b> loss of access to the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to Hüningen.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly decided <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> <b>the</b> Chinooks from {{service in}} May 1989. This {{decision}} was made to reduce costs, the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability. Due to the Chinooks' high operating costs, only six of the helicopters were in service at the time. No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Blücher and {{the damage}} done to Lützow caused the German force <b>to</b> <b>withdraw.</b> <b>The</b> ground troops were landed on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord; they {{proceeded}} inland and captured the Oscarborg Fortress by 09:00 on 10 April. They then moved on to attack the capital. Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E
