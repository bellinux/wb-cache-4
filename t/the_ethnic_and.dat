25|$|Small genetic {{differences}} were reportedly found among Southeastern European (Greece, Albania) populations and {{especially those of}} the Dniester–Carpathian (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region. Despite this low level of differentiation between them, tree reconstruction and principal component analyses allowed a distinction between Balkan–Carpathian (Romanians, Moldovans, Ukrainians, Macedonians and Gagauzes) and Balkan Mediterranean (Greeks, Albanians, Turks) population groups. The genetic affinities among Dniester–Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships. According to the report, {{the results indicate that}} <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> genetic differentiations occurred in these regions to a considerable extent independently of each other.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Empire or Byzantium is {{the term}} {{conventionally}} used since the 19th century to describe <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> Greek-speaking Roman Empire of the Middle Ages, centered on its capital of Constantinople. As the direct continuation of the Roman Empire, Byzantium survived {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire during Late Antiquity, and continued to function until its conquest by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. During this time, many different imperial dynasties ruled over the empire; in the context of Byzantine history, the period c.1185 – c.1204 AD was under the Angeloi dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The Nordic Bronze Age (also Northern Bronze Age, or Scandinavian Bronze Age) is {{a period}} of Scandinavian {{prehistory}} from c. 1700–500 BC.

The archaeological legacy of the Nordic Bronze Age culture is rich, but <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> linguistic affinities of it are unknown, in the absence of written sources. Some scholars also include sites in what is now Estonia, northern Germany and Pomerania, as part of its cultural sphere.|$|E

25|$|The {{confrontation}} was an undeclared {{war with}} most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia). The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat, set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship. Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations {{on either side of the}} border. Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> religious diversity in Sabah and Sarawak compared to that of Malaya and Singapore, with the intent of unraveling the proposed state of Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States in spite of <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} re-definition of the Adriatic Littoral {{was considered}} {{during the war}} on a theoretical level. In a telegram sent on 9 September 1943 to foreign minister Ribbentrop, Gauleiter Rainer suggests the future establishment of Reich protectorates in Gorizia, Istria and Carniola, based on the subdivisions of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Initial German occupation policy, however, favored incorporating the area into the Reichsgau of Carinthia. The ethnic complexity of the region was {{to be used to}} minimize Italian influence, promote ethnic , and introduce Germandom as a stabilizing force. This strategy was based on an understanding of history of medieval Germany and the Habsburg monarchy, where the German lords and nobles were seen to have made the economic and administrative development of the region possible.|$|E
25|$|A fairly rigid {{caste system}} {{existed in the}} Philippines during the Spanish colonial era. The goal, or end-state, sought by the First Philippine Republic was a sovereign, independent, stable nation led by an oligarchy {{composed}} {{of members of the}} educated class (known as the ilustrado class). Local chieftains, landowners, businessmen and cabezas de barangay were the principales who controlled local politics. The war was at its peak when ilustrados, principales, and peasants were unified in opposition to annexation by the United States. The peasants, who represented the majority of the fighting forces, had interests different from their ilustrado leaders and the principales of their villages. Coupled with <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> geographic fragmentation, aligning the interests of people from different social castes was a daunting task. The challenge for Aguinaldo and his generals was to sustain unified Filipino public opposition; this was the revolutionaries' strategic center of gravity.|$|E
25|$|In {{a vicious}} spiral of sectarian violence, civilians were an easy target. On 18 January 1976 an {{estimated}} 1,000–1,500 {{people were killed}} by Maronite forces in the Karantina Massacre, followed two days later by a retaliatory strike on Damour by Palestinian militias. These two massacres prompted a mass exodus of Muslims and Christians, as people fearing retribution fled to areas {{under the control of}} their own sect. <b>The</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> religious layout of the residential areas of the capital encouraged this process, and East and West Beirut were increasingly transformed into what was in effect Christian and Muslim Beirut. Also, the number of Maronite leftists who had allied with the LNM, and Muslim conservatives with the government, dropped sharply, as the war revealed itself as an utterly sectarian conflict. Another effect of the massacres was to bring in Yassir Arafat's well-armed Fatah and thereby the Palestine Liberation Organisation {{on the side of the}} LNM, as Palestinian sentiment was by now completely hostile to the Maronite forces.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> {{economic gap}} in Malaysia before the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1970 {{and after the}} end of the NEP in 1986. Specifically, this paper uses the Duncan Dissimilarity Index to estimate occupation segregation between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese; <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians before <b>and</b> after the policy. Next, the paper estimates the wage gap between the three ethnicities by using A Generalized Oaxaca Decomposition, both before and after the NEP. The data of this study is obtained from two principal sources. Data concerning wage and salary figures is obtained fromthe 1966 - 67 West Malaysian Family Survey; 1976 - 77 First Malaysian Family Life Survey; and the 1988 Second Malaysian Family Life Survey. The other sources of data variables are obtained from the 1970 Population Census of Peninsular Malaysia; the 1980 Population Census of Peninsular Malaysia; and the 1991 Population and Housing Census of Malaysia. The study finds that occupation segregation was reduced between all ethnicities by the end of the NEP. However, the wage gap between <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Malays; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians continued to rise after 1986. Additionally, while the wage gap decreased between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> Indians in some specific occupations, the wage gap increased between <b>ethnic</b> Malays <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese in all specific occupations during the same period...|$|R
