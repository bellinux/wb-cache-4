5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E

5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single question {{in a number of}} ways. Next, students discuss the problem with the teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>children</b> such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E

25|$|Other theorists in {{developmental}} psychology {{have suggested that}} religiosity comes naturally <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies.

25|$|Throughout the 1950 and 60s, while {{teaching}} part-time, Diesendorf had numerous involvements in education, among them addressing the Wyndham Enquiry into public education. She {{was active in}} the Teachers Federation and the Federation of Parents and Citizens, and was the leading speaker at meetings throughout New South Wales in a campaign against Wyndham's recommendation to adopt solely comprehensive high schools, and in favour of the retention of selective high schools for talented students. She advocated the teaching of languages <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> and presented Moliere's one-act plays, with ten-year-old actors, in the local church hall.

25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar <b>to</b> <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists {{worked very hard to}} strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E
