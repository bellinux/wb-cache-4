40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of mental health problems in later life, older people markedly underutilize mental health services. A greater awareness of factors influencing older peoples' attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> may therefore improve awareness and treatment of mental disorders in this population. A mixed methodology approach was used to explore and compare older peoples' attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> {{in a sample of}} clinical and non-clinical participants. Results indicated that, similar to younger people, older people endorsed a range of positive and negative attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness.</b> However, when attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> were considered within the context of ageing and experience a more complex pattern of results emerged. Although negative attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> were associated with negative attitudes to ageing across the entire sample, clinical participants (and those with prior experience of mental illness) reported more positive attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> and more negative attitudes to ageing than non-clinical participants, for whom the reverse was true. Attitudes were also differentially related to health behaviour outcomes. Results suggest that attitudes <b>to</b> mental <b>illness</b> and ageing may be linked and mediated by personal experience and capacity for psychological self-regulation in the face of age-associated adversity...|$|R

During this time, Bard shifted the psychological focus from the role of personality in predisposing one <b>to</b> <b>illnesses</b> <b>to</b> the psychological consequences of living with illnesses like cancer.|$|R

5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over half their troops <b>to</b> <b>illness</b> and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers {{that did not}} fit the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E

5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed <b>to</b> <b>illness</b> as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E

A 13-year-old Rosas served distributing {{ammunition}} to troops in a force organised by Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{to counter the}} invasion.

Rosas was then assigned to the Caballería de los Migueletes (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due <b>to</b> <b>illness.</b>|$|E

Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E

These internees were buried at Stanley Military Cemetery.|$|E

5000|$|Psychogenic disease (or {{psychogenic}} illness) {{is a name}} given <b>to</b> physical <b>illnesses</b> {{that are}} believed to arise from emotional or mental stressors, or from psychological or psychiatric disorders.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} data on {{the reporting}} of <b>illnesses,</b> disability due <b>to</b> <b>illnesses</b> and the decision to seek medical attention for illnesses among {{a representative sample of}} Mexican-Americans, Black-Americans and White-Americans in Los Angeles. Few differences were observed among these groups with respect to the reporting of <b>illnesses,</b> disability due <b>to</b> <b>illnesses</b> or in the frequency with which <b>illnesses</b> were brought <b>to</b> medical attention. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regressions were run for each of these variables within each of these subgroups. Some differences were found among these groups in the variables that predicted illness reporting, disability and the use of physician services for illnesses. These differences indicate that ethnicity affects health behaviour through its interaction with other variables. Speculations are offered regarding the meaning and historical sources of the differences observed. ...|$|R
