40|$|The {{field of}} nonverbal {{communication}} {{has been given}} more and more attention in the academic circle of intercultural communication. However, {{as far as the}} time issue is concerned, it requires a thorough study. Particularly, the <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> of the Chinese traditional culture has not been fully covered. This paper makes a special effort in the exploration of the unique values underlying the traditional Chinese culture <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> by making a comparison with the western <b>time</b> <b>orientation.</b> It analyzes the subjective, flexible and relative features of traditional Chinese culture <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> by specifically investigating the unique values of past-time focus. It will discuss the pursuit of the right occasion in Confucianism’s <b>time</b> <b>orientation,</b> as well as the relativity view and carefree manner of spending time in Taoism’s <b>time</b> <b>orientation.</b> The paper finally concludes that the subjective, flexible, and relative approaches of the traditional Chinese culture <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> can provide meaningful revelations to the western world, which has laid much emphasis on the objective, absolute, and future-focus <b>time</b> <b>orientation.</b> Edward Hall once regarded nonverbal communication as a hidden dimension people ha...|$|R

40|$|An {{orientation}} of an undirected graph G is a directed graph obtained by replacing each edge {u,v} of G by exactly {{one of the}} arcs (u,v) or (v,u). In the min-sum k -paths <b>orientation</b> <b>problem,</b> the input is an undirected graph G and ordered pairs (s i,t i), where i∈{ 1, 2,…,k}. The goal is to find an {{orientation of}} G that minimizes the sum over all i∈{ 1, 2,…,k} of the distance from s i to t i. In the min-sum k edge-disjoint paths problem, the input is the same, however {{the goal is to}} find for every i∈{ 1, 2,…,k} a path between s i and t i so that these paths are edge-disjoint and the sum of their lengths is minimum. Note that, for every fixed k≥ 2, the question of N P-hardness for the min-sum k-paths <b>orientation</b> <b>problem</b> and for the min-sum k edge-disjoint paths problem has been open for more than two decades.

Consideration of the immediate and future consequences of these choices (i. e., <b>time</b> <b>orientation)</b> {{can be an important}} predictor of eating and exercising behavior. The objective was to show that behavior-specific <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> differentially predicts eating and exercising behavior. Two studies were conducted among students (N = 55) and the general public (N = 165). Participants completed two adapted versions (for food and exercise) of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFC), each consisting of the subscales CFC-future and CFC-immediate. Thereafter they reported their eating and exercising behavior. Study 1 showed that CFC-food, but not CFC-exercise, predicted eating behavior. Similarly, both studies showed that CFC-exercise, but not CFC-food, predicted exercising behavior. Moreover, eating behavior was predicted by CFC-food/immediate, whereas exercising behavior was predicted by CFC-exercise/future. In conclusion, behavior-specific <b>time</b> <b>orientation</b> predicts behavior within a behavioral domain but less well across behavioral domains.

40|$|Network {{and complex}} system models {{are useful for}} {{studying}} {{a wide range of}} phenomena, from disease spread to traffic flow. Because of the broad applicability of the framework it is important to develop effective simulations and algorithms for complex networks. This dissertation presents contributions to two applied problems in this area First, we study an electro-optical, nonlinear, and time-delayed feedback loop commonly used in applications that require a broad range of chaotic behavior. For this system we detail a discrete-time simulation model, exploring the model's synchronization behavior under specific coupling conditions. Expanding upon already published results that investigated changes in feedback strength, we explore how both time-delay and nonlinear sensitivity impact synchronization. We also relax the requirement of strictly identical systems components to study how synchronization regions are affected when coupled systems have non-identical components (parameters). Last, we allow wider variance in coupling strengths, including unique strengths to each system, to identify a rich synchronization region not previously seen. In our second application, we take a complex networks approach to improving genome assembly algorithms. One key part of sequencing a genome is solving the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem.</b> The <b>orientation</b> <b>problem</b> is finding the relative orientations for each data fragment generated during sequencing. By viewing the genomic data as a network we can apply standard analysis techniques for community finding and utilize the significantly modular structure of the data. This structure informs development and application of two new heuristics based on (A) genetic algorithms and (B) hierarchical clustering for solving the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem.</b> Genetic algorithms allow us to preserve some internal structure while quickly exploring a large solution space. We present studies using a multi-scale genetic algorithm to solve the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem.</b> We show that this approach can be used in conjunction with currently used methods to identify a better solution to the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem.</b> Our hierarchical algorithm further utilizes the modular structure of the data. By progressively solving and merging sub-problems together we pick optimal `local' solutions while allowing more global corrections to occur later.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, the problem of genome {{assembly}} has received considerable attention from both biologists and computer scientists. An important component of current assembly methods is the scaffolding process. This process involves building ordered and oriented linear collections of contigs (continuous overlapping sequence reads) called scaffolds and relies {{on the use of}} mate pair data. A mate pair is a set of two reads that are sequenced from the ends of a single fragment of DNA, and therefore have opposite mutual orientations. When two reads of a mate-pair are placed into two different contigs, one can infer the mutual orientation of these contigs. While several orientation algorithms exist as part of assembly programs, all encounter challenges while solving the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem</b> due to errors from mis-assemblies in contigs or errors in read placements. In this paper we present an algorithm based on hierarchical clustering that independently solves the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem</b> and is robust to errors. We show that our algorithm can correctly solve the <b>orientation</b> <b>problem</b> for both faux (generated) assembly data and real assembly data for R. sphaeroides bacteria. We demonstrate that our algorithm is stable to both changes in the initial orientations as well as noise in the data, making it advantageous compared to traditional approaches.
