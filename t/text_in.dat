The data analysis are from the reading <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> the English textbook “Bahasa Inggris” for X grade of senior high school 2013 curriculum, published by “Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan” in the year of 2016. The data analyzed by counting the number and average of sentences, words and syllables of each text used Flesch Readability Formula (Reading Ease Formula). Finally, the researcher interpreted based on the result.

Since the <b>texts</b> <b>in</b> fairly difficult level are higher than other texts, it means that according to the theory of Flesch Reading Ease the <b>texts</b> are <b>in</b> the appropriate level for tenth grade students...|$|R
