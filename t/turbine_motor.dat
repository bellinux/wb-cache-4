50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an {{aircraft}} APU is to provide power to start the main engines. Turbine engines must be accelerated to a high rotational speed to provide sufficient air compression for self-sustaining operation. Smaller jet engines are usually started by an electric motor, while larger engines are usually started by an air <b>turbine</b> <b>motor.</b> Before the engines are to be turned, the APU is started, generally by a battery or hydraulic accumulator. Once the APU is running, it provides power (electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic, depending on the design) to start the aircraft's main engines.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} proposed Coiled Tube Turbodrilling technology for drilling deep hard rocks mineral exploration. Coiled Tube (CT) is a continuous length of ductile steel or composite tube that itself cannot rotate {{and therefore a}} down hole motor is needed to provide mechanical power to the bit. Amongst the down hole motors, turbodrills (turbine down hole motors) are an excellent fit with CT operations for hard rocks, providing a smooth borehole with little vibrational effects during drilling with high output rotational speed. The <b>turbine</b> <b>motor</b> section has multistage of rotors and stators which convert the hydraulic power to mechanical power. This paper presents a methodology for designing turbodrills with asymmetric rotor or stator blades configurations. Here, the turbodrill is designed specifically for small size CT system providing suitable output power and rotation speed with applicable input flow properties. Also, {{the results of a}} few numerical simulations carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code are presented. The results help in choosing the best <b>turbine</b> <b>motor</b> configurations to obtain optimum rotational speed and torque during drilling hard rocks for small hole size exploration applications.

50|$|Alternative {{sump pump}} {{systems can be}} driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered sump pumps are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors. There are no impellers, <b>turbines,</b> <b>motors,</b> or mechanical parts to wear out. There are no batteries, wires, or chargers to monitor, tend to, or replace.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-At {{any place}} on the planet, there is a normal {{temperature}} of + 30 ◦C per km dug into the earth. Therefore, if one digs 20, 000 feet the temperature will be about 190 ◦C above the surface temperature. This difference {{will be enough to}} produce electricity. However, no useful and economical technology has been developed to extracted this large source of energy. In this paper we are proposing a new economical method to harness this energy using PLC. Direct sources function by sending water down a well to be heated by the Earth’s warmth. Then a heat pump is used to take the heat from the underground water to the substance that heats the house. Then after the water it is cooled is injected back into the Earth using PLC & SCADA.
