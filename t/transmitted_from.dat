5|$|A METI {{message was}} sent to 55 Cancri. It was <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> Eurasia's largest radar– 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 2; it was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 55 Cancri in May 2044.|$|E
5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E

50|$|KPXN's {{analog signal}} on UHF channel 30 {{was the last}} {{television}} station to <b>transmit</b> <b>from</b> Sunset Ridge in the Mount San Antonio range. At one time, KDOC (channel 56; now broadcasting from Mt. Wilson), KSCI (channel 18) and KRCA (channel 62; both now <b>transmitting</b> <b>from</b> Mt. Harvard) broadcast their signals from Sunset Ridge as well. KPXN's digital transmitter, on UHF channel 38 <b>transmits</b> <b>from</b> Mt. Harvard. San Diegans can receive 30.1 through 30.6 with an antenna pointed towards Mt. Wilson.|$|R
5|$|On campaign, {{following}} {{the assembly of}} the various squadrons at fortified bases (aplēkta) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the baggage train (touldon) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away {{in the event of}} battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> ship to ship through signal flags (kamelaukia) and lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their {{guns on the}} target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E
5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot {{the fall of the}} shells.|$|E

5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
5|$|The BBC's {{national}} DAB ensemble broadcasts on {{frequency block}} 12B (225.648 MHz) across the United Kingdom, with coverage currently at 96.4%.

The BBC's national multiplex carries only BBC national radio stations. Local BBC radio stations are carried on the relevant local DAB ensemble where commercial DAB licences are operating.|$|E
5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, Ares. During this period, the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) {{makes no mention of}} the planets.|$|E

5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> British and French fishermen to natives on {{the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection). The plague killed between 90% and 95% of the local Wampanoag inhabitants. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site left their cornfields and cleared areas vacant for the Pilgrims to occupy; it also meant that the Native Americans were in no condition to resist {{the arrival of the}} colonists.|$|E
5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the main bearing, thus colouring the sound. To further increase isolation, the Xerxes possesses a spindle {{that allows the}} user to centre the record, but {{which is supposed to}} be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} to New York {{to perform the}} first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC {{did not have a}} studio on the West Coast, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a borrowed empty soundstage at RKO Radio Pictures. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared {{out at the end of}} each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> one {{organism}} to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|In {{a speech}} at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian {{domination}} and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.|$|E

5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were <b>transmitted</b> <b>from</b> every object, {{and that they could}} be detected using pendulum dowsing. In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E
