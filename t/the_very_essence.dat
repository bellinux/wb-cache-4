5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E

Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them.

25|$|The {{efforts and}} fervor of the {{erstwhile}} Anti-colonial {{leader of the}} Dervish state of Somalia, who {{by the time of}} his death had reclaimed and united large swathes of the lands historically territorial to the Somali peoples, to this day inspires and mobilizes the autochthonous peoples of Somalia to form a consolidated bulwark against imperialism (namely that of Ethiopia) as captured in the struggles of the Islamic Courts Union, the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and the former Western Somali Liberation Front. Hassan has thus become more than just a token of pride for the various sectional groups in Somalia, but has also been seen by some as icon of Pan-Somalism, at times even distinguished as one of the great revolutionaries of the turn of the 20th century by notable Pan-Africanist movements, who led the Senussid resistance against the Italians.

25|$|The {{structure}} of the three realms follows a common numerical pattern of 9 plus 1, {{for a total of}} 10: 9 circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; 9 rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the Garden of Eden crowning its summit; and the 9 celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the Empyrean containing <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of God. Within each group of 9, 7 elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while 2 others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the seven deadly sins of the Catholic Church that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the Late repentant and the excommunicated by the church. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love (Lust, Gluttony, Greed), deficient love (Sloth), and malicious love (Wrath, Envy, Pride).|$|E

A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E

From Converse to cake, this book examines how their 'brands' lend credibility to commerce, while the increasing worth placed on the singers provides a modern example of a secular belief system propelled by media, technology and the value of immediacy in the 2. 0 world. Journeys to spaces and places associated with the two singers are akin to pilgrimages, sacred trips that hope to capture and connect with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>essences</b> that <b>the</b> men have been stripped of in their ever-widening appeal. Within this context, Curtis and Cobain become guides and anglicised role models in the search for personal identity and community in the modern, uncertain world...|$|R

500|$|Goya {{does not}} focus on {{the reasons for the}} shortage, nor does he {{apportion}} blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents [...] "a darkness that seems to be <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished.|$|E

Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness".

Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original.
