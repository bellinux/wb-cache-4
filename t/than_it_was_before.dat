This left Josh's birth date between his sisters,' Kendall's (1976) and Bianca Montgomery's (1984), with his now set at December 18, 1980.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sphere}} of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated {{during the war and}} had been largely {{agricultural}} since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the European Union and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> 1939.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the overall}} decline of KRON as an independent, its newscasts {{initially}} pulled in respectable ratings though viewership was lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the station lost its NBC affiliation. During the February 2004 sweeps period, the station placed {{second in the}} ratings behind KTVU. However, KRON's news viewership has gradually fallen since that point; also in 2004, the station posted an 8.7% market share, down from the 21% share it had as an NBC affiliate. The 9 p.m. newscast created after becoming independent eventually fell to fourth place by 2005. In March 2006, KRON's morning newscast posted an average viewership of approximately 28,000 viewers. By 2009, overall viewership for the station's newscasts had fallen to fifth place among the Bay Area's news-producing English-language television stations.|$|E
25|$|The war {{resulted}} in increased autonomy for the constituent {{states of the}} Holy Roman Empire, limiting {{the power of the}} emperor and decentralizing authority in German-speaking central Europe. For Austria and Bavaria, the result of the war was ambiguous. Bavaria was defeated, devastated, and occupied, but it gained some territory {{as a result of the}} treaty in 1648. Austria had utterly failed in reasserting its authority in the empire, but it had successfully suppressed Protestantism in its own dominions. Compared to large parts of Germany, most of its territory was not significantly devastated, and its army was stronger after the war <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before,</b> unlike that of most other states of the empire. This, along with the shrewd diplomacy of Ferdinand III, allowed it to play an important role in the following decades and to regain some authority among the other German states to face the growing threats of the Ottoman Empire and France.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, 74.6 {{percent of}} the city's {{businesses}} were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7percent in industry. Although industry is less significant <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten {{percent of the}} total Nantes–Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the Ottoman Empire's {{expansion}} into Hungarian territory, Bratislava was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, {{ahead of the}} old Hungarian capital of Buda falling in 1541. It {{become part of the}} Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as Upper Hungary, became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the Magyar nobility fleeing the Turks and far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before.</b> Partly thanks to old Hussite families, and Slovaks studying under Martin Luther, the region then experienced a growth in Protestants. For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were Lutherans. They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighboring Transylvania, a rival continuation of the Magyar state that practiced religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent border wars and changes to the frontier, which was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by German and Italian troops on the Habsburg side. The Ottoman wars, rivalry between Austria and Transylvania, and the frequent insurrections against the Habsburg Monarchy inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas. In the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664) a Turkish army led by the Grand Vizier decimated Slovakia. Even so, Slovaks from the Principality of Upper Hungary fought alongside the Turks against the Austrians at the Battle of Vienna of 1683. As the Turks withdrew from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although Pressburg retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E

2500|$|Sunset Park {{began to}} suffer {{economic}} decline even before World War II, {{due to the}} Great Depression, the demolition of the Fifth Avenue El, and the 1941 construction and widening of the Gowanus Expressway. After the war, [...] "white flight", the maritime industry's move to New Jersey, and the deactivation of the Brooklyn Army Terminal from the 1970s also hurt the neighborhood until the terminal was reopened as an industrial park in 1987. However, this decline did not greatly affect Bush Terminal, because although its piers are now defunct and its rail system is much smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> World War II (and not operated by Bush Terminal), the buildings and warehouses at Bush Terminal did not suffer the abandonment so common across the United States after World War II.|$|E
