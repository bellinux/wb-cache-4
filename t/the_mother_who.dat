5|$|Ray's {{international}} career {{started in}} earnest after {{the success of}} his next film, Aparajito (The Unvanquished). This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> loves him. Critics such as Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak rank it higher than Ray's first film. Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, bringing Ray considerable acclaim. Before completing The Apu Trilogy, Ray directed and released two other films: the comic Parash Pathar (The Philosopher's Stone), and Jalsaghar (The Music Room), a film about the decadence of the Zamindars, considered one of his most important works.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
5|$|The Gazel Ministry {{uses the}} Gaetia Key, an {{artifact}} that manipulates the DNA of {{massive amounts of}} humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful Gear called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other. They learn {{that they are the}} reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan {{around the time of the}} war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, <b>the</b> <b>Mother,</b> <b>who</b> must be sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated.|$|E

25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play.

500|$|... "Formal cooperation" [...] in {{abortion}} incurs the penalty of excommunication [...] "by the very commission of the offense" [...] (Lat. latae sententiae, [...] "sentence [...] passed"). The Catechism emphasizes that this penalty {{is not meant}} to restrict mercy, but that it makes clear the gravity of the crime and the irreparable harm done to the child, its parents and society. [...] "Formal cooperation" [...] {{in abortion}} extends not just to <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> freely submits, but also to the doctor, nurses and anyone who directly aids in the act. The Church has ministries of reconciliation, such as Project Rachel, for those who sincerely repent of their sin of formal cooperation in abortion.|$|E
500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls her tone [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".|$|E

500|$|Although {{neither had}} any {{associations}} {{with the film}} industry, Janowitz and Mayer wrote a script over six weeks {{during the winter of}} 1918–19. In describing their roles, Janowitz called himself [...] "the father who planted the seed, and Mayer <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> conceived and ripened it". The Expressionist filmmaker Paul Wegener was among their influences. The story was partially inspired by a circus sideshow the two visited on Kantstrasse in Berlin, called [...] "Man or Machine?", in which a man performed feats of great strength after becoming hypnotized. They first visualized the story of Caligari the night of that show. Several of Janowitz's past experiences influenced his writing, including memories of his hometown of Prague, and, as he put it, a mistrust of [...] "the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad" [...] due to his military service. Janowitz also believed he had witnessed a murder in 1913 near an amusement park on Hamburg's Reeperbahn, beside the Holstenwall, which served as another inspiration for the script. According to Janowitz, he observed a woman disappear into some bushes, from which a respectable-looking man emerged a few moments later, and the next day Janowitz learned the girl was murdered. Holstenwall later became the name of the town setting in Caligari.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby {{used the}} phrase [...] "mother (or {{permanent}} mother substitute)". As it is commonly used, the term maternal deprivation is ambiguous as {{it is unclear whether}} the deprivation is that of the biological mother, of an adoptive or foster mother, a consistent caregiving adult of any gender or relationship to the child, of an emotional relationship, or of the experience of the type of care called [...] "mothering" [...] in many cultures. Questions about the exact meaning of this term are by no means new, as the following statement by Mary Ainsworth in 1962 indicates: [...] "Although in the early months of life it is <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> almost invariably interacts most with the child ... the role of other figures, especially the father, is acknowledged to be significant ... aternal deprivation ... has received scant attention ... institutionalization ... the term 'parental deprivation' would have been more accurate, for the child has been ... deprived of interaction with a father-figure as well as a mother-figure ... discourage the use of [...] and encourage the substitution of the terms 'insufficiency', 'discontinuity', and 'distortion' instead." [...] Ainsworth implies, neither the word [...] "maternal" [...] nor the word [...] "deprivation" [...] seems to be a literally correct definition of the phenomenon under consideration.|$|E
500|$|Most critics {{feel that}} Baxter is {{presented}} well in Mom & Me & Mom. [...] Candace Smith, who reviews the audio {{version of the}} book, states that Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother, who comes across [...] "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example". [...] Vanessa Bush of Booklist calls the book a [...] "loving recollection of a complicated relationship" [...] and a [...] "remarkable and deeply revealing chronicle of love and healing". [...] Russo states that the book is [...] "a beautiful tribute to Baxter's independent, vibrant, and courageous spirit". [...] Evaristo disagrees, and states that Baxter comes across as [...] "less rounded, less interesting, more sanctified and less credible" [...] than Angelou describes her elsewhere. [...] Sturges calls the book [...] "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond". [...] The most interesting part of the book, according to Sturges, is [...] "Angelou's casual overturning {{of the idea of}} <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> abandons her children as monstrous and inhumane". [...] Sturges also says that Baxter is presented as unapologetic, charismatic, independent, and resilient, traits that [...] "have seemingly been passed on to her daughter". [...] Reviewer Valerie Sayers insists that the scenes that depict Angelou's [...] "halting steps" [...] towards her forgiveness and acceptance of her mother are {{among the best in the}} book. [...] Sayers labels Mom & Me & Mom [...] "an account of forgiveness", and like Angelou and Baxter, [...] "just revealing enough, and pretty irresistible". [...] Like her mother expected from her, Angelou expects her readers to move past their resentments and [...] "whatever was unbearable". [...] Sayers also calls both Baxter and Angelou [...] "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mother's spirit.|$|E

"It is <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>who</b> first {{occupies}} {{the position of}} the big Other for the child," [...] Dylan Evans explains, [...] "it is she who receives the child's primitive cries and retroactively sanctions them as a particular message". The castration complex is formed when the child discovers that this Other is not complete because there is a [...] "Lack (manque)" [...] in the Other. This means that there is always a signifier missing from the trove of signifiers constituted by the Other. Lacan illustrates this incomplete Other graphically by striking a bar through the symbol A; hence another name for the castrated, incomplete Other is the [...] "barred Other." ...|$|E
