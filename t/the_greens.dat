5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. <b>The</b> <b>greens</b> lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> on the main course were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> over time.|$|E
5|$|Green is {{a common}} color for sports teams. Well-known teams include A.S. Saint-Étienne of France, known as Les Verts (<b>The</b> <b>Greens).</b> A number of {{national}} soccer teams feature the color, with the color usually reflective of the teams' national flag.|$|E
5|$|The Blues and <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> {{were now}} more than simply sports teams. They gained {{influence}} in military, political, and theological matters, although the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, {{in spite of the}} fact that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue-Green rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>greens</b> are edible as a leaf vegetable, but {{are rarely}} eaten by humans; some sources suggest that <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> contain toxic alkaloids. When {{used for this}} purpose, they are {{harvested}} young in high-density plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E

5|$|By 77 BC, {{the rivalry}} between the Red and the Whites was already developed, when a funeral for a Red driver {{involved}} a Red supporter throwing {{himself on the}} funeral pyre. No writer of the time, however, refers to these as factions such as came into existence later, with the factions being official organizations. Writing {{near the beginning of}} the third century, he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars, the Whites to the Zephyrs, <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> to Mother Earth or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. Domitian created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, which disappeared soon after he died. The Blues and <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> gradually became the most prestigious factions, supported by emperor and populace alike. Numerous occasions occurred when a Blue vs. Green clash would break out during a race. Indeed, Reds and Whites are only rarely mentioned in the surviving literature, although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse-tablets.|$|E
5|$|Chariot {{racing in}} the Byzantine Empire also {{included}} the Roman racing clubs, which {{continued to play}} {{a prominent role in}} these public exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (Vénetoi) and <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> (Prásinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites (Leukoí) and Reds (Roúsioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red. These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost-cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions, and supported the interests of either the Blues or <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Chief Minister {{is elected}} by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers {{alongside}} him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet. Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals {{have been able to}} gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 25-year history, mostly during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, when Labor won power. At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT's first majority government, but after the 2008 election was forced into minority government with the support of <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b> Since the 2012 elections, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and <b>the</b> <b>Greens.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Israel {{has always}} {{formally}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line has no legal significance, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line {{continued to have}} political, legal and administrative significance.

The territories beyond <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Line were administered by the Israeli military or later also by the Palestinian Authority.

5000|$|Golfers use {{a method}} known as [...] "reading" [...] <b>the</b> <b>green</b> {{to enhance their}} chances of making a putt. Reading a <b>green</b> {{involves}} determining <b>the</b> speed, grain, incline, decline and tilt of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> on <b>the</b> line of the putt. Most putts are not struck directly at the hole, instead they must be struck {{to take into account}} the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> to arrive at the hole at the proper angle and speed. The best players will read <b>the</b> <b>green</b> by walking around <b>the</b> <b>green</b> and studying <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>green</b> before addressing <b>the</b> ball.

5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died.

5|$|During {{the period}} <b>the</b> <b>Greens</b> were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} his last year of medical school. Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties. She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although <b>the</b> <b>greens</b> are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
