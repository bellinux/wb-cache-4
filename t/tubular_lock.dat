5000|$|Chicago Lock Co. is a lock manufacturer, {{founded in}} Chicago in 1920. Since 1933, it has sold a <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> marketed under the {{registered}} trademark [...] "Ace." [...] Millions of Ace locks have been sold; for instance, these locks {{are used in}} Northwestern Corporation's Triple Play bulk vending machine.In 2004 it was widely publicized that {{the barrel of a}} cheap ballpoint pen would act as an effective lock pick for many brands of <b>tubular</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> pick is a {{specialized}} lockpicking tool used for opening a tubular pin tumbler lock. <b>Tubular</b> <b>lock</b> picks {{are all very}} similar in design and come in sizes to fit all major tubular locks, including 6, 7, 8, and 10-pin locks. The tool is simply inserted into the lock and turned clockwise with medium torque. As the tool is pushed into the lock, each of the pins is slowly forced down until they stop, thus binding the driver pins behind the shear line of the lock. When the final pick is pushed down, the shear plane is clear and the lock opens. This can usually be accomplished {{in a matter of}} seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> picks {{come with}} a [...] "decoder" [...] which lets the {{locksmith}} know at what depths the pins broke the shear plane. By using the decoding key after the lock has been picked, the locksmith can cut a tubular key to the correct pin depths and thus avoid having to replace the lock.|$|E
50|$|They {{produce a}} range of {{residential}} <b>lock</b> products, including <b>tubular</b> <b>locks,</b> key locking hardware sets, electronic keyless locks, deadbolts, and Mortise locks. They also provide cabinet and drawer pulls for interior spaces like Kitchen cabinets and bathroom cabinets.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>tubular</b> <b>locks,</b> such {{as those}} used on certain models of kryptonite bike locks, can be opened with {{the back end of}} a ball point pen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tubular</b> <b>locks</b> are {{commonly}} seen on bicycle locks (such as the Kryptonite lock), Kensington computer locks, elevators, {{and a variety}} of coin-operated devices such as vending machines, and coin-operated washing machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> {{is similar to the}} pin tumbler lock, in that there are several stacks of pins. The key is a {{cylinder}} shape with notches cut around the outer or (rarely) inner edge. Each of these notches depresses a single pin inside the lock to a specific height allowing the lock cylinder to turn freely.|$|E
50|$|Such locks can {{be picked}} {{by a special}} <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> pick {{with a minimum of}} effort in very little time; it is also {{possible}} to defeat them by drilling with a hole-saw drill bit. Standard tubular-lock drill bit diameters are 0.375 in and 0.394 in. To prevent drilling, many tubular locks have a middle pin made from hardened steel or contain a ball bearing in the middle pin.|$|E
50|$|Kwikset is an American {{lock and}} lockset {{manufacturer}} owned by Spectrum Brands Hardware and Home Improvement Group (HHI), a Division of Spectrum Brands. Kwikset {{was founded in}} 1946 by Adolf Schoepe and Karl Rhinehart. The name {{was derived from the}} company's first locks, which pioneered the then-revolutionary <b>tubular</b> <b>lock</b> design, which were relatively fast to install. Kwikset key blanks (KW1 or Axxess #66) are available at almost every location where keys can be made.|$|E
50|$|Tobias has {{analyzed}} and released numerous security alerts {{with regard to}} the security flaws in locks, ranging from high security, state-of-the-art systems that are installed in the White House and the Pentagon to the basic pin-tumbler cylinder locks that are commonly used around the world. He has been responsible for the disclosure of such security defects as the bypass of <b>tubular</b> <b>locks</b> with ball point pens, the insecurity of gun locks that are relied upon to protect children, many popular consumer security devices, lock bumping in the United States, and most recently the security flaws {{in one of the most}} recognized high-security locks in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The great {{majority}} of locks now in use on residences in North America are {{a variation of the}} cylindrical lock and are known as <b>tubular</b> chassis <b>locks.</b> Generally, they are not as strong as a cylindrical lock.|$|R
50|$|Until 2004, Kryptonite <b>locks</b> {{used the}} <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>locking</b> mechanism. In 2005, {{after it was}} {{demonstrated}} that the <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>locks</b> used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of a Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, Kryptonite changed their <b>locks</b> from the <b>tubular</b> to a disc mechanism, preventing the use of cylindrically-shaped objects to defeat the locking system.After this problem became public, Kryptonite offered a free exchange program for all owners of <b>locks</b> with <b>tubular</b> mechanisms.Kryptonite launched a Messenger Collection in 2015, created with input from actual bicycle messengers in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Crick and Watson's DNA {{model and}} the protein-building kits of Kendrew {{were among the first}} {{skeletal}} models. These were based on atomic components where the valences were represented by rods; the atoms were points at the intersections. Bonds were created by linking components with <b>tubular</b> connectors with <b>locking</b> screws.|$|R
50|$|In 1805, the {{earliest}} patent for a double-acting pin tumbler lock was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England. It {{was based on}} earlier Egyptian locks and Joseph Bramah's <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>lock.</b> Two years later, Stansbury was granted a patent in the United States for his lock.|$|R
50|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock (or Yale lock, after lock {{manufacturers}} Yale) is {{a lock mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>locks</b> (also known as radial locks or ace locks).|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external tapered surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces. The annular compression ring is disposed within a <b>tubular</b> <b>locking</b> nut which threadedly couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between the tapered surfaces. The nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The threaded coupling to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between the tapered surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place. The clamped cannula provides a seamless joint connection to the pump pipe outlet where the clamping force is uniformly applied to the cannula because of self alignment of the tapered surfaces. The nut can be easily disconnected to replace the pump if necessary...|$|R
50|$|A tubular key (sometimes {{referred}} to as a ace, radial or barrel key) is one that is designed to open a <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>lock.</b> It has a hollow, cylindrical shaft that is usually much shorter and has a larger diameter than most conventional keys. Tubular keys are commonly found on vending machines, launderettes, bike locks (such as the kryptonite lock) and laptop security cables.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tubular</b> {{pin tumbler}} <b>locks</b> are {{generally}} considered to be safer and more resistant to picking than standard locks. This is primarily because they are often seen on coin boxes for vending machines and coin-operated machines, such as those used in a laundromat. However, the primary reason the locks are used in these applications is their lack of the depth requirement that most other locks require.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tubular</b> {{pin tumbler}} <b>lock,</b> {{also known as}} a circle pin tumbler lock, radial lock, or Ace lock after its {{original}} manufacturer, is a variety of pin tumbler lock in which a number of pins are arranged in a circular pattern, and the corresponding key is tubular or cylindrical in shape. Most locks use between six and eight pins, although some use as few as four or as many as ten.|$|R
50|$|The Bramah lock used a {{cylindrical}} key and keyhole. The {{end of the}} key had {{a number}} of different slots of varying depths, which, when inserted into the lock, would press a number of wafers to a specified depth and enable the key to turn and open the lock. It shares some similarities to a modern <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>lock,</b> however it used fixed wafers instead of two-part pins. The original Bramah lock had 18 different wafers, which allowed for 470 million possible permutations.|$|R
25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} <b>tubular</b> or radial <b>locks.</b> The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|R
25|$|Until 1998, {{when it was}} {{withdrawn}} from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard <b>tubular</b> pin tumbler <b>lock</b> (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard allen key was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.|$|R
