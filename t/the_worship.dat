5|$|Eorpwald was {{the first}} English king to be killed because of his Christian faith. The {{circumstances}} are not recorded, {{so that it is}} not known whether Ricberht was representative of an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule, or if he was an emissary from abroad wishing to diminish Edwin of Northumbria's influence over the East Angles. The return of East Anglia to pagan rule {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was an overt struggle between <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> of the Anglo-Saxon gods and <b>the</b> <b>worship</b> of Christ, but could express a reaction away from Christianity amongst the East Angles, prompted by Edwin's rise to power and his subsequent dominance over their king. The ancestry of Ricberht is unknown and it is unclear as to whether he ever ruled after he killed Eorpwald, but in 630 or 631, three years after Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from exile in Gaul and became king of the East Angles.|$|E

Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. <b>The</b> <b>worship</b> of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). <b>The</b> <b>worship</b> of subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages.

5000|$|The races {{each have}} their own god or gods. <b>The</b> Humans <b>worship</b> a pantheon always {{referred}} to as a group [...] "the gods" [...] not as individual gods. There are individual notes between the human cultures in worshiping them. <b>The</b> Orks <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> gods who live in their holy mountain and pay special attention to signs read by their shamans. <b>The</b> Elves <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> Father and Mother, and <b>the</b> Dwarves <b>worship</b> <b>the</b> Wolf. The Taan also have a pantheon of gods, however, unlike the other races, they seem to separate them as individuals representing or having power over various events. The Pecwae are never really discussed, but frequently refer to simply the gods, similar to humans. It is not made clear in the books if all the gods are one group or separate groups. However, since the gods gave the Sovereign Stone to all the races through the King of Vinnengael it is likely that there is one pantheon perceived differently by the different races.|$|R
