5|$|According to the Ethnologue, 389 {{languages}} (nearly 6%) {{have more}} than a million speakers.

5|$|Cave 19 is a cell {{without a}} front wall and a bench {{runs along the}} left wall. The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or wooden screen from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench. To <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E

5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is {{a fork in the}} road: to the left is NY185, and to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a road to a housing development. Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E
5|$|Close to the {{controversial}} cave are other monuments. One {{of them is}} a small shrine consisting of a 7th-century rock carving of Anantashayana Vishnu, or reclining Vishnu with Lakshmi and Garuda in namaste posture. Vishnu is shown restarting the cosmic cycle by giving birth to all of existence. Above the reclining carved relief are the ten avatars of Vishnu – Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. Between the Narasimha and Vamana is shown a relief of Brahma cord connected to Vishnu's navel. To the left of the relief is depicted the Trinity – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, while to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a human couple and a mother cow with a calf feeding.|$|E
5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are {{monophyletic}} (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants). There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are, and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates, which were marine animals. The cladogram on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007). Other views include proposals that: scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion-like eurypterids than to spiders; spiders and Amblypygi are a monophyletic group. The appearance of several multi-way branchings in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> {{forgotten}} {{has emerged}} {{so as to}} build legal foundations for data subjects to be relieved from misappropriation of personal data on the Internet. However, studies of information systems (IS) on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> forgotten and related issues are rare as agreements of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>are</b> diverse according to legal and cultural backgrounds. IS researchers should conduct both explorative and exploitative research {{in order to build}} a firm knowledge base for a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> forgotten from the IS perspective. Doing so would help academia, legislators, and governments, and individuals to understand effects of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> on social, technological and psychological point of view. By suggesting a research agenda to investigate <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> forgotten, this study sheds light on IS research direction of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to <b>be</b> forgotten...|$|R
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{arms were}} {{confirmed}} by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, {{and at the same}} time the crest (a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of supporters for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword representing William Longespee who in 1248 granted the town's first charter; on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a dragon derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I who granted Poole county corporate status in 1568. The Latin motto – Ad Morem Villae De Poole, means: According to the Custom of the Town of Poole, and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.|$|E

5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded steps {{leading up to}} the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are {{octagonal}} turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E

If the court establishes that the right being violated is a fundamental right, it applies strict scrutiny and asks whether the law is justified by a compelling state interest and whether the law is narrowly tailored to address that interest.|$|E
