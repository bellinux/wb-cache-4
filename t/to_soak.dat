5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is similar}} to the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last of Us. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> Riley.|$|E

5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} changes due to {{crosslinking}} treatment in stiffness, permeability, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content of bovine intervertebral discs. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the mechanical and biochemical effects of crosslinking treatment on lumbar bovine tissue. Previous studies have found that crosslinking can increase stiffness and permeability in the intervertebral disc. These changes have not yet been investigated by confined compression, stress-relaxation tests of young bovine tissue. Eleven lumbar motion segments were harvested from calf spines and soaked in a saline solution or one of four crosslinking treatments (genipin, methylglyoxal, proanthrocyanidin, and EDC). Five mm diameter samples were removed from the midannulus region at anterior / anterior-lateral locations, confined in a saline bath, swelled to equilibrium, and tested in confined compression stress-relaxation to 15 % strain in 5 % increments. Radial samples were also harvested, treated with saline solution and EDC, and tested in the same manner. The aggregate modulus and hydraulic permeability were calculated using the nonlinear biphasic theory. Swelling pressure was calculated as the load at swelling equilibrium. GAG content was measured using the dimethylmethylene blue assay. Differences with P value < 0. 05 were considered significant. In the axial orientation, all crosslinking treatments except methyglyoxal at least doubled the aggregate modulus relative <b>to</b> <b>soaked</b> controls (P less than 0. 05). Genipin treatment resulted in 78 % lower axial permeability, proanthrocyanidin (PA) 50 % lower, and EDC treatment 84 % lower relative <b>to</b> <b>soaked</b> controls (P < 0. 05). GAG content measured in the methyglyoxal treatment group was 25 % lower than in soaked control group. Genipin (G), proanthrocyanidin (PA), and EDC treatment increased the swelling pressure by at least 65 % (P less than 0. 05). In the radial orientation, EDC treatment increased the stiffness by 75 %, and did not significantly affect the permeability or swelling pressure. Some crosslinking treatments proved effective in increasing the stiffness and swelling pressure of the disc. The increased swelling pressure in G, PA, and EDC treatment groups relative <b>to</b> <b>soaked</b> controls suggests reduced GAG leaching during soaking treatment, further confirmed by the reduction in permeability in these groups...|$|R
