40|$|AbstractWe used {{binocular}} rivalry as a psychophysical probe to explore center-surround interactions in orientation, motion and color processing.

At low contrast, addition of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> boosted dominance of orientation and motion targets matched to <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> This contrast-dependent modulation of center-surround interactions {{seems to be a}} general property of the visual system and may reflect an adaptive balance between surround suppression and spatial summation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of color contrast on luminance discrimination. Observers were required to indicate the more intense of two stimuli presented briefly in a surround. In some conditions the two stimuli were the same chromaticity as <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> while in other conditions the stimuli differed in chromaticity from <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> <b>The</b> luminance of the fixed test stimulus was varied in different conditions over a range from below <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> level to above <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> level. Difference thresholds were proportional to the luminance difference between test and surround over much of the range. However, difference thresholds were higher at low luminance contrasts when the chromatic contrast between the stimuli and <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> was high. Results also indicate that the effects of chromatic contrast may be mediated by local contrast mechanisms, but that the relationship between threshold and luminance contrast is not mediated entirely by these local contrast mechanisms...|$|R

The responsiveness of neurons in V 1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals from <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences from <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> by studying <b>the</b> interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> influence was always suppressive when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> grating was at the neuron’s preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> grating also moved in the neuron’s preferred direction, rather than it...|$|R

Second, when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> and <b>the</b> centre are counter-rotating, the perceived speed of the centre is enhanced. Third, even when the surface size of the centre matches the surface size of <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> swaying of <b>the</b> centre is unable to induce {{significant changes in the}} perceived speed of <b>the</b> <b>surround,</b> whereas swaying of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> still induces changes in the perceived speed of the centre...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} (217 / 325, 66 %) of the neurons in {{the middle}} temporal (MT) area/V 5 show strong antagonistic surrounds, defined here by a decrease of at least 50 % in the summation curve. We mapped <b>the</b> antagonistic <b>surround</b> in 145 such cells, using eight circularly distributed surround stimulus patches (Surround Asymmetry Test, SAT) and also mapped <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> in 51 of these 145 cells using a grid consisting of 25 square patches (Surround Mapping Test, SMT). Both tests showed that <b>the</b> angular <b>surround</b> distribution was non-uniform {{in the majority of}} these neurons. In half the neurons, <b>the</b> antagonistic <b>surround</b> was asymmetric, and arose from a single region {{on one side of the}} excitatory receptive field (ERF). In another quarter of <b>the</b> sample <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> was bilaterally symmetric, and arose from a pair of regions on opposite sides of the ERF. Only the remaining 20 % showed a circularly symmetric surround distribution. These three groups differed in their laminar distribution. The SMT showed that, radially, <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> antagonism reached a maximum, on average, at 1. 5 times the ERF radius, Detailed comparisons of the spatial relationships of excitatory and inhibitory regions of the RF components shows that non-homogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> influence appears to be an intrinsic property of <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> Such a property may underly the extraction of the surface orientation and curvature from speed patterns...|$|R

40|$|Contrast {{sensitivity}} {{is known}} to be strongly influenced by <b>the</b> target <b>surround,</b> yet <b>the</b> role of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> interaction in visual processing remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> strongly suppresses contrast sensitivity in the periphery when <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> spatial frequency and orientation match those of the target (Petrov, Carandini, & McKee, 2005). Here, we explore how various spatial characteristics of the iso-oriented and frequency-matched surround, such as surround phase and spatial layout, affect suppression. We manipulated surround geometry (annulus ring, half annulus, and bow tie) and its separation from the target (both laterally and in depth) and varied the position of the half-annulus and bow-tie surrounds with respect to Gabor target’s orientation and with respect to its location in the visual field (i. e., radial vs. tangential surrounds). We also compared monoptic, dichoptic, and binocular surround suppression. Except for a significant radialYtangential anisotropy, only the area of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> and <b>the</b> lateral separation between <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> and target had a significant effect on the magnitude of suppression. We showed that, although suppression amplitude remains constant with stimulus eccentricity, the lateral extent of suppression scales in proportion to the eccentricity. The most surprising finding was that <b>the</b> extent of <b>surround</b> suppression does not scale with stimulus size or spatial frequency. We suggest that <b>the</b> properties of <b>surround</b> suppression are best explained by a mechanism that selects salient targets for subsequent saccades...|$|R
