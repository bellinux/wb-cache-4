5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara Croft Go <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a re-skin, so an emphasis {{has been placed on}} the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> one.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovak {{education}} in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature {{to that of the}} Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E

5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{a cross between a}} crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1938 Zaolzie was annexed by Poland {{following}} the Munich Conference. The Polish Army, commanded by General Władysław Bortnowski, annexed {{an area of}} 801.5km² (309.5mi²) {{with a population of}} 227,399. The Polish side argued that Poles in Zaolzie deserved the same rights as Germans in the Munich Agreement. The vast majority of the local Polish population enthusiastically welcomed the change, seeing it as a liberation and a form of historical justice. But they quickly changed their mood. The new Polish authorities appointed people from Poland to various positions from which Czechs had been dismissed. The Polish language became the sole official language. Rapid Polonization followed. Czech organizations were dismantled and their activity was prohibited. Czech education ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechs emigrated to Czechoslovakia by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature to that of the Czech authorities before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often dismissed from their jobs. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie.

5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking Racing {{was meant}} to enable {{a broad range of}} strategies, such as keeping up but {{watching}} out for destruction opportunities, destroying the cars in front, and destroying everything without concern for position. This was hard to balance, but it proved possible to win with each of those strategies. Edmondson came up with Stock Car Racing after watching the Banger World Finals at Arena Essex and noticing that there were some cars simply racing rather than trying to destroy each other. The normal race mode was implemented simply because the engine could support running a traditional race. For Destruction Derby mode, more varied arenas were implemented {{to take advantage of a}} new physics system developed by Reflections. Edmondson decided against implementing features such as speed boosts and collectibles because he did not want the game <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an arcade game and wanted the car physics to be as realistic as possible. Destruction Derby 2 was released on the PlayStation in 1996, and a PC version soon followed. The next instalment in the Destruction Derby series, Destruction Derby Raw, was released in 2000.|$|E

25|$|In children, {{assessment}} of infantile reflexes {{is also a}} diagnostic tool, such as the Moro reflex and the Romberg Test. The Moro reflex is rarely present in infants after 6 months of age and is characterized {{as a response to}} a sudden loss of support that causes the infant <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it is falling. The infant will respond by abduction and adduction (or spreading and unspreading) of the arms, as well as crying. The Moro reflex is significant in evaluating the integration of the central nervous system and patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will show a persistence and exacerbation of the reflex. In addition, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy will rarely show a positive Romberg test, which indicates that there is localized cerebellar dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E
