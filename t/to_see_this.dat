5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He had come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E

5|$|Part of Johnson's {{campaign}} for relief was {{the abolition of}} the practice of debt imprisonment nationwide. It would take him nearly ten years <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> goal accomplished. He first spoke to the issue in the Senate on December 14, 1822, introducing a bill to end the practice, and pointing to the positive effects its cessation had effected in his home state. The bill failed, but Johnson persisted in re-introducing it every year. In 1824, it passed the Senate, but was too late to be acted upon by the House. It passed the Senate a second time in 1828, but again, the House failed to act on it, and the measure died for some years, owing to Johnson's exit from the Senate the next year.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> (<b>this</b> covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this,</b> and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these {{chronometers}} for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted detent by mounting the locking piece on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots.
