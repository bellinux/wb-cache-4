500|$|Construction on {{the road}} system began in 1956, and the {{contract}} for construction of the bridge was signed by Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach on 16 March 1957. The bridge was built by Danish firm Christiani and Nielsen in conjunction with Western Australian engineering firm J. O. Clough & Son. Leif Ott Nilsen oversaw construction on behalf of Christiani and Nielsen. The first <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> for the temporary staging for the construction was driven at noon on 8 June 1957.

The last river pile was driven home in November 1958, and the final concrete beam was lowered into position in June 1959.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went out}} to the <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> and {{selected}} a bamboo cane about twenty feet long, not too heavy to be handled easily, and holding it up like a lance I marched to the gate and started swinging it round as I approached him, and showing a cheerful countenance. [...] "What {{are you going to do}} with that cane?" [...] he shouted, a little apprehensively. [...] "Wait and see," [...] I returned. [...] "Something to make you laugh." [...] Then, after whirling it round half a dozen times more, I suddenly brought it down on his head with all my force, and did exactly what I had been counselled to do by the wise shepherd--knocked him clean off his horse. But he was not stunned, and starting up in a screeching fury, he pulled out his knife to kill me. And I, for strategic reasons, retreated, rather hastily. But his wild cries quickly brought several persons on the scene, and, recovering courage, I went back and said triumphantly, [...] "Now we are quits!" [...] Then my father was called and asked to judge between us, and after hearing both sides he smiled and said his judgment was not needed, that we had already settled it all ourselves, and there was nothing now between us. I laughed, and he glared at me, and mounting his horse, rode off without another word. It was, however, only because he was suffering from the blow on his head; when I met him we were good friends again.|$|E

40|$|The {{three most}} common ground {{improvement}} methodologies used by engineers {{to mitigate the}} potential damage from liquefaction include densification, drainage, and reinforcement. Conventional driven <b>timber</b> <b>piles</b> {{can be used as}} ground improvement by providing dens-ification and reinforcement to the subgrade. <b>Timber</b> <b>piles</b> modified to provide drainage may be able to achieve all three improvement methodologies in one improvement method, or improve the magnitude of densification by virtue of relieving driving-induced excess pore pressure. Conventional and drained <b>timber</b> <b>piles</b> were installed to investigate the effect of pile spacing, time, and drainage on densification. Following installation of <b>timber</b> <b>piles</b> spaced at two, three, four, and five diameters, cone penetration tests were conducted at various durations following installation to evaluate the degree of densification, the effect of time, and the role of fines content on the degree of densification. In general, the relative density of the soils improved from approximately 40 to 50 % pre-installation to 60 to 80 % depending on the pile spacing and the presence of drainage elements. The effect of improvement on liquefaction resistances is described in terms of the factor of safety against triggering for each of the pile spacings...|$|R

5000|$|A {{right of}} way was granted to the Southern Pacific {{railroad}} in 1887 and narrow ledges were blasted for the tracks. Since {{there was no room}} for a wagon road after that, the idea of building a series of wooden causeway around the cliffs was first developed in 1910. The idea was taken from the European models that existed at the time in Monte Carlo. The [...] "causeway," [...] a <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> trestle with a 16 ft roadway, was built as part of the Rincon Sea Level Road, a cooperative project between Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties.

5000|$|Gipple's Quarry Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located {{in a rural area}} southwest of Columbus Junction, Iowa, United States. The Louisa County Board of Supervisors approved the petition of T.J. Gipple in April 1893 to replace a <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> bridge over Buffington Creek, which was near his stone quarry. They awarded a $1,174 contract to the Gillette-Herzog Manufacturing Company of Minneapolis to build two bridges. [...] The second span was the County Line Bridge over Long Creek in Columbus Township. The bridge span is supported by stone masonry abutments and piers. The steel components of the bridge were rolled by Carnegie, Gillette-Herzog in Pittsburgh. The pony truss bridge is typical of those built in the same era in Iowa, however, like County Line Bridge it has an unusual lower chord configuration with end panels that slope downward from the bearing shoes to the center panels. [...] It has subsequently been abandoned. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) tubular piles {{have been developed}} for civil engineering applications instead of conventional concrete piles. Considering their suitable applications, the new polymer based filling materials are being developed at the University of Southern Queensland as a part of work done for <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> rehabilitation. This ongoing project aims to replace portion of the deteriorated <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> by using GFRP piles. Due to good compressive strength, pumpability and workability, the new polymer base materials are to be filled in between GFRP pile and existing <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> base. An ongoing research program has been initiated to improve fundamental understanding of these materials and to provide the knowledge required for their broad utilization. In this development, sample trial mixes were considered based on several weight percentages of polymer resin, fly ash and sand. Material parameters such as compressive strength, stiffness, shrinkage and gel time were achieved from the experimental investigation. It has been found that most polymer based trial mixed fillers have high compressive strength and considerable plastic region with more than 10 % strain. These results imply that the polymer based filling materials are suitable for both compression and tensile loading situations. However, the behaviour of fillers with GFRP pile connector under different loading conditions is yet to be fully understood...|$|E

25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding <b>timber</b> <b>piles</b> is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber will last for a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 <b>timber</b> <b>piles</b> that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|R

40|$|This report {{outlines}} the forensic {{investigation of the}} collapse of Bridge No. SN 019 - 5010 in DeKalb County, Illinois on August 19, 2008. The bridge consisted of three 42 feet precast prestressed concrete deck beams simply-supported by concrete pile caps with a <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> foundation. Assessment based on site investigation, in situ readings, and analysis indicated that a geotechnical or superstructure failure may be ruled out. Samples of the oak timber piles were retrieved and tested under pure compression as well as combined compression and flexure. Laboratory testing results of these specimens were used to calibrate an analytical model of a full-scale single <b>timber</b> <b>pile.</b> The analytical model considered both symmetrical and unsymmetrical loading of the bridge. The results of the analytical model were used to determine the required live load to initiate collapse. The results of the investigation indicate that structural overload, leading to fracturing of the timber piles in combined compression and flexure, is the likely reason for the bridge failure.

40|$|Fibre {{composites}} have inherent {{material properties}} that {{are better than}} other existing materials such as steel, timber, or concrete in numerous environments. In the marine and ground-zone environments in particular, fibre composite materials can be selected for their corrosion, rot, and pest resistance, as well as high strength-to-weight ratio. The advantages of fibre composites over traditional construction materials, is their high strength, light weight, less corrosive, durable, and most importantly, no decay / deterioration by natural organisms, which is the dominant problem for timber piles used in water front structures. This research project, focused {{on the development of}} a system for decayed timber piles replacement, for piers, jetties, bridges and boardwalks, using fibre composite technology to enable rehabilitation of the structures, as well as new construction, by using Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) tubular pile and connector. Three objectives were considered to examine the structural behaviour of GFRP tubular piles and connector used for novel <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> rehabilitation technique. As the first objective, the effects of various loading scenarios on the capacity of the GFRP hollow tubular piles were investigated. Then as a second objective, numerical simulations were performed using the finite element analysis approach to verify experiments, and study the behaviour of the overall pile rehabilitation system. Based on the results of these numerical simulations, further research areas were highlighted for filler material development, which was used to fill the space between the GFRP connector and the existing <b>timber</b> <b>pile.</b> Due to durability, pumpability, workability and compressive strength requirements, polyester resin based filler development was chosen. As the third objective, appropriate polyester based filler materials were developed for the GFRP tubular connector, to transfer the vertical load from the super structure, to the original timber stump, by the connector. A research program has been initiated to improve the fundamental understanding of this rehabilitation concept. A new polyester based filler material has been considered to provide the working knowledge required for its broad utilisation. Fibre composites have not been used in this specific manner previously. While there have been fibre composite wraps developed, these are not the replacement systems, and have inherent weaknesses in their application, being more difficult to install, and needing to be highly tailored to specific instances. The concept developed, tested and verified in this study is viable for general <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> rehabilitations in piers / jetties with reasonable factor of safety and will be possible to extended rural two lane timber bridges. The results of this research, reveals a system, designed from an engineering perspective, relatively simple to install. Further, it is favourably disposed to mass production processes, to gain efficiencies of scale. Finally, this targeted research project, uncovers a <b>timber</b> <b>pile</b> rehabilitation system, capable of accepting the full working loads, while also ensuring a life span of some 50 - 100 years, with minimal maintenance. ...|$|E
