In Reeid's amateur version, after either verdict the judge berates the jurors for their bad judgment and declares that they cannot serve on a jury again.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped pick <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> in the O. J. Simpson murder trial.

He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool was most detrimental to {{the selection of a}} prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{derivation}} of <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system from <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> of Henry II. To this end, a short history of English law {{and the history of}} the development of <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> is given. <b>The</b> method of <b>the</b> English <b>jury's</b> development is used to show the evolution of <b>the</b> early American <b>jury</b> into <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> of today. <b>The</b> American <b>jury</b> still resembles <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> from which it evolved. The American system has a grand jury to indict criminals and a petit <b>jury</b> to try <b>the</b> case. The practice of taking an oath was begun by the English jurors and is still in practice in American today as well as the challenging of potential jurors for bias. The American system differs from <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> of old in its inability to determine matters of law and in its move away from unanimity in verdicts and <b>the</b> twelve-man <b>jury.</b> Some of <b>the</b> aspects of <b>the</b> historical English <b>jury</b> are still in use in <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system of today, but some differences have been created through case law and legislation. It will come to no surprise, however, that the most important characteristics of <b>the</b> historical English <b>jury</b> are still present in the American system today.
