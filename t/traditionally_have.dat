5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good {{contacts with}} nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The Vlaams Blok did <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the Centre Democrats and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations {{particularly with the}} French National Front, {{as well as the}} German People's Union, The Republicans and National Democratic Party of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E
5|$|Herdwick lambs {{are born}} black, {{and after a}} year they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before {{chemical}} dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks—now replaced by ear tags.|$|E

5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E

25|$|Catholics also, however, {{share the}} same {{viewpoint}} with the Orthodox {{when it comes to}} image veneration, believing that whenever approached, sacred images are to be reverenced. Though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings, Catholics <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> also favored images in the form of three-dimensional statuary, whereas in the East, statuary is much less widely employed.|$|E
25|$|Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be {{effectively}} managed {{with the administration}} of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often {{used in conjunction with}} thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.|$|E

25|$|Around 93 {{percent of}} Azerbaijan's {{population}} is nominally Muslim, while about 5 {{percent of the}} population adheres to Russian Orthodox Church. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance is relatively low and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity rather than religion.

25|$|In {{order to}} meet recyclers' needs while {{providing}} manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry. Because municipal recycling programs <b>traditionally</b> <b>have</b> targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the resin coding system offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.|$|E
