25|$|Coal mining {{remained}} the prominent industry in Pittston for many decades, but disasters did strike {{on more than}} one occasion. The first major tragedy occurred in the Newton Coal Company's <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> Mine (near the city's railroad junction). In {{the early morning hours of}} June 28, 1896, ninety miners were at work in the Red Ash Vein of the Newton Coal Company's <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> Mine in Pittston. At 3:00 a.m., the roof quickly caved-in. The concussion from the explosion was so great that it was heard for miles around. The foundation of nearly every building in Pittston was shaken. The cave-in killed 58 miners (including the city's then-acting mayor, Michael J. Langan).|$|E
25|$|The mining theory {{behind the}} {{ultimately}} wasteful {{development of the}} Pottsville <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> operation was not well grounded in the geologic science even of that time. But that theory alone did not make up Gowen's rationale for the massive expenditures of the Coal & Iron Co. He believed that the Schuylkill Valley—which from colonial times until the Civil War had been the center of American iron-making—would, because {{of the importance of}} anthracite iron, continue to hold that preeminent position indefinitely. He stated this belief forthrightly in the Reading Railroad annual report for 1870; but already the use of lower-cost coke made from more widely available bituminous coal, together with expanding markets in the Midwest and West, was driving the center of the iron industry (and soon, steelmaking) to Pittsburgh. Already the importance of anthracite as an indispensable industrial fuel was slipping.|$|E
2500|$|The aggressively {{expansive}} {{operations of}} the Coal & Iron Co., including the <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> project, required vast outlays of money, and the coal and iron operations were not returning a profit on those outlays. [...] Rather, the source of Coal & Iron Co. funding was an increasing load of debt owed by the parent railroad: [...] increased by US$65 million during {{the first five years}} of Gowen's presidency—almost twice the railroad's valuation when he took the helm in 1869. Annual interest on this debt, about US$4 million, was a little less than the average profit of the railroad during those years. The public face of the Reading Railroad's finances—prospectuses and annual reports—obscured these realities.|$|E

2500|$|Yulius Fuchik was {{powered by}} four 16-cylinder Wärtsilä-Pielstick 16PC2-5V400 medium-speed diesel engines located amidships, each {{producing}} [...] at 504 rpm. The engines were coupled via double input/single output reduction gearboxes to two [...] KaMeWa controllable pitch propellers turning at 135 rpm. The propeller shafts were of considerable length, and thus {{had to be}} supported by six bearings. The propulsion system gave the ship a maximum speed of , but her typical service speed was slightly less, [...] Underway, the ship burned heavy fuel oil {{at a rate of}} 128 tons per day. The propulsion system of Yulius Fuchik was the largest deviation from the original Seabee design which utilized a single [...] steam turbine coupled to a fixed pitch propeller instead of the <b>twin</b> <b>shaft</b> diesel power plant.|$|E
2500|$|In {{collaboration}} with his close friend, George deBenneville Keim—who had bought Gowen's Pottsville home in 1864, and was subsequently appointed {{first president of}} the Coal & Iron Co.—Gowen's perhaps most crucial business bet was made upon these lands: [...] development of the Pottsville <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> Colliery. [...] This enterprise was based on a theory of mining the Schuylkill Basin coal field promoted by Eli Bowen in his 1862 book, Coal, and the Coal Trade, where he called for [...] "large capital" [...] to sink two [...] "enormously deep and permanent shafts" [...] to a depth of two thousand feet [...] "before a single pound of coal is allowed to be sent to market." [...] "ith night and day shifts,” Bowen estimated, the shafts “could be sunk down within two or three years." [...] Shafts once sunk, the [...] "mining would be carried on night and day, with three eight-hour shifts." [...] "fterwards you can work it like a machine." [...] The object of these deep diggings was to reach the famous Mammoth Vein, an undulating seam of high-quality anthracite twenty-five feet thick, projected as providing a virtually inexhaustible supply. [...] This indeed was the shared vision and plan of Gowen and Keim from the outset of the Coal & Iron Co.|$|E

Originally, the colliery had its own branch from the Coventry Canal, but in 1919 with the return of the men from the First World War, production increased.

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and <b>Twin</b> <b>shaft</b> mixer. The <b>twin</b> <b>shaft</b> mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|E

5000|$|The {{investigating}} committee {{suggested that}} pillars of coal {{should be left}} standing for safety and not [...] "robbed" [...] of their coal, especially when two seams are mined at once, and that maps of mine workings and air tunnels be provided to mine inspectors.

50|$|Labor {{activity}} was notoriously dangerous at the time. Just before Mitchell became president, the Lattimer Massacre had seen 19 miners killed by police and 58 miners {{died in the}} <b>Twin</b> <b>Shaft</b> Disaster one year earlier. But this was also a period of growth for the union: the number of members grew almost tenfold, from 34,000 to 300,000, during Mitchell's term. Mitchell engaged in contentious negotiations with mining companies, including one in which President Theodore Roosevelt had to intervene, resulting in an eight-hour workday and a minimum wage.|$|E
50|$|Hawkeye State was a turbine steamship, {{with four}} steam {{turbines}} driving <b>twin</b> propeller <b>shafts</b> by single reduction gearing giving a service speed of 17.5 kn.|$|R
50|$|The vessels' {{design was}} {{initially}} intended to incorporate a conventional icebreaking bow for cruising, {{and would have}} proceeded backwards for breaking heavy ice. The vessels' stern would have been designed for ice breaking {{and they would have}} employed azimuth thrusters for propulsion and for chewing through resistant ice. However, due to cost constraints, a conventional bow-first design was chosen for both light and heavy icebreaking. The propulsion would be provided by diesel-electric <b>twin</b> <b>shafts</b> with bolt on propellers, similar to existing Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers.|$|R
50|$|Type 035: First {{unit of the}} Ming class submarine, with {{construction}} of 2 units begun simultaneously in October 1969 in Wuchang Shipyard and Jiangnan Shipyard. The general designer was Mr. Wei Xumin (魏绪民). The most significant difference between Type 035 Ming class and Type 033 Wuhan class is that the former is driven by a single <b>shaft</b> instead of <b>twin</b> <b>shafts</b> of the latter. Trials completed in October 1974 and this first unit (original pennant number 162, but later changed to 232) built at Jiangnan Shipyard entered Chinese service in the following month.|$|R
