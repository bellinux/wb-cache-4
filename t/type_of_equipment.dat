5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack. At 10:45, White requested permission to evacuate the garrison, but {{he was told to}} stay and wait for the arrival of reinforcements. However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent the insertion of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> that could not be taken or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the command bunker and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers. The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E
5|$|Player characters' combat {{abilities}} and skills are dictated by a character class-based job system. The {{jobs in the}} initial launch were Warrior, Priest, Mage, Martial Artist, Thief, and Minstrel. Later updates added further jobs, such as the Beast Tamer and Dancer. Each job has a separate skill point system that allows customization, and jobs can be changed at dedicated temples found in each major town. Player characters can also adopt Trades, skills that include woodwork, weapon and armor forging among others. Each Trade skill requires materials gathered from the overworld, which are then {{used to create a}} specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> unique to the gathered materials and Trade. Weapons and items are acquired either in battle alongside in-game currency or through Guilds scattered through Bazaars located in major towns. Guilds will forge new gear, weapons and items for a combined fee of money and materials salvaged from the game world. Also found in towns are vendors where excess items can be stored, merchants which buy and sell various items, and tailor's establishments where the player character can gain new outfits.|$|E

25|$|Surface-supplied diving {{equipment}} and techniques are mainly used in professional diving or military diving {{due to the}} greater cost and complexity of owning and operating the equipment. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> is used in saturation diving, as the gas supply is relatively secure, and the diver can not bail out to the surface, and for diving in contaminated water, where the diver must be protected from the environment, and helmets are generally used for environmental isolation.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} distressed or expired stock, distressed {{inventory}} is inventory whose {{potential to be}} sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products which have reached their expiry date, or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing which is out of fashion, music which is no longer popular and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> e.g. VHS format equipment and videos.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: to husk a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at the card table.|$|E
500|$|The tight {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty raised many challenges and required difficult compromises {{if they were to}} be met. To avoid the class being outgunned by the new ships of foreign navies, especially as by the mid-1930s the Treaty had been renounced by Japan and Italy, Churchill wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1936, voicing strong objections to the proposed armament of 10 14-inch guns. His proposal was for nine 16-inch guns. However, when completed King George V mounted ten [...] guns. They were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. They could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: [...] "A" [...] turret, 286 degrees; [...] "B" [...] turret, 270 degrees and [...] "Y" [...] turret, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was achieved through a hydraulic drive, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed 15,950 pounds; a salvo could be fired every 30 seconds. The quadruple turrets weighed 1,582 tons, the twin turret 915 tons. The turrets were designed by the Vickers Armstrong's Elswick Works, but sets of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> were manufactured by Vickers Armstrongs in Barrow. A considerable amount of design effort was expended to make the turrets as flashtight as possible. This complicated the mechanical design of the turrets, particularly the quadruple mountings. Due to insufficient clearances and slightly distorted link mechanisms, failures in the intricate safety interlocks in the loading sequence for antiflash precautions caused jams during drills and practice firing. During the summer of 1941 the King George V-class battleships, had their main armament turrets and turret linkages modified to correct the operational faults revealed during the hunt and destruction of Bismarck. HMS King George V used an Admiralty Fire Control Table Mark IX to control her main armament.|$|E

2500|$|An {{early use}} of {{one type of}} barcode in an {{industrial}} context {{was sponsored by the}} Association of American Railroads in the late 1960s. [...] Developed by General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) and called KarTrak ACI (Automatic Car Identification), this scheme involved placing colored stripes in various combinations on steel plates which were affixed to the sides of railroad rolling stock. [...] Two plates were used per car, one on each side, with the arrangement of the colored stripes encoding information such as ownership, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment,</b> and identification number. [...] The plates were read by a trackside scanner, located for instance, at the entrance to a classification yard, while the car was moving past. [...] The project was abandoned after about ten years because the system proved unreliable after long-term use.|$|E
2500|$|The next area of {{responsibility}} involves the triage of incoming calls, providing expert systematized caller interrogation, using the script provided by the Emergency Medical Dispatch system, {{in order to determine}} the likely severity of the patient's illness or injury, so that the most appropriate type of response resource may be expedited. [...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine response speed, the type of resources dispathed, or the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by decision-support software.|$|E
