5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|After {{targeting}} another {{character and}} initiating combat, the player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with their weapons. This continues until the player stops or {{the target is}} dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy's body.|$|E
5|$|The 1997 Castlevania Legends for the Game Boy was Alucard's third {{appearance}} in the series. Similar to his initial {{appearance in}} Dracula's Curse, he is a boss challenging <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's protagonist, Sonia Belmont. After she defeats him, he accepts her strength and decides to submerge his powers by sleeping, believing that she will defeat Dracula in his stead. Koji Igarashi later removed Castlevania Legends from the official canon of the series, meaning that {{the plot of the}} game never occurred in the series' continuity.|$|E

The musical instrument and <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musician are equally <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> productive labour, but are themselves unproductively consumed.|$|R

5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, {{but rather as a}} demonstration of <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as a gift from the Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue. The statue features Christopher Columbus, was created in 1893 by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Tied {{into the}} battle {{system is a}} Job system: {{beginning}} with the Freelancer, the party can gain additional Jobs by obtaining gems called Asterisks from defeated human bosses. Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipped Job, the skills of a second Job can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies. Friend characters can also be summoned from other players' games: the more a friend summon is used, the more effective their actions become. Descriptions of defeated enemies, along with story recaps and descriptions of locations, are included in an item called D's journal.|$|E

These were extremely complex moves orchestrated with flawless efficiency, a tribute to <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops and their commander. Hasdrubal Barca did not have such assets at Dertosa.|$|R
25|$|The {{first people}} to leave lasting traces and {{cultural}} heritage throughout the Balkan region were the Thracians. Their origin remains obscure. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of indigenous peoples and Indo-Europeans {{from the time of}} Proto-Indo-European expansion in the Early Bronze Age when the latter, around 1500 BC, conquered the indigenous peoples. Thracian craftsmen inherited <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous civilisations before them, especially in gold working.|$|E

Unfortunately the machine-carving industry, initiated in the 1950s and the Second Vatican Council, caused hundreds of carvers in Val Gardena to quit their craft. A worldwide trade of machine-carved figuerines and statues ensued.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factors, {{apart from the}} reaction of the enemy and the terrain, in a Fireforce operation were the reliability of intelligence and the skill of the operations commander. The majority of successful engagements were enabled by <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Selous Scouts (many of whom were former enemy); they had the capacity to insert observation posts into the bush without being noticed by the inhabitants. The difficulty of commanding the scene was extreme and good Fireforce commanders were highly prized by the men.|$|E

Artists and intellectuals took refuge at Alhambra after the Reconquista began to roll back Muslim territory.

25|$|In {{composing}} the opera, Mozart evidently {{kept in mind}} <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singers {{intended for}} the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary comic actors asked to sing for the occasion. Thus, the vocal lines for Papageno—sung by Schikaneder himself—and Monostatos (Johann Joseph Nouseul) are often stated first in the strings so the singer can find his pitch, and are frequently doubled by instruments. In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer, who premiered {{the role of the}} Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is famous for its difficulty. In ensembles, Mozart skillfully combined voices of different ability levels.|$|E
