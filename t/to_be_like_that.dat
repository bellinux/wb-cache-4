500|$|Fields left no written lectures {{from her}} USC years, but a {{transcript}} exists from a 1975 seminar {{that she gave}} at the American Film Institute. In one characteristic excerpt she said that, [...] "There's a feeling of movement in telling a story {{and there is a}} flow. A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, unless you want it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> On Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of}} the track, it is a story that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know something that you do not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E

500|$|This chapter {{discusses}} Batesian mimicry, also mentioning {{observations and}} opinions of Fritz Müller and Wallace. Beddard grants that Bates's theory is very strongly {{supported by the}} observations that Bates made in South America, especially on butterflies, though again he tests the evolutionary explanation in different cases. He cites Wallace's rules of mimicry, such as that the imitators are always the more defenceless, and always less numerous, than their models, as covering all the examples he has given. However, he then states various objections, including that [...] "the Danaidae, themselves an uneatable race of butterflies and models for mimicry, resemble in South America the uneatable Heliconiidae". He points out that this does not meet any of Wallace's rules so it is [...] "not a case of true mimicry", but is [...] "supposed rather <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> which is seen between various other unpalatable animals". Müllerian mimicry is not mentioned explicitly in the book, though Beddard does write that this example [...] "tends {{to the advantage of}} the insects, for their enemies have to learn fewer colours and patterns, and thus are less likely to make mistakes, than if the lesson to be learnt were an excessively complicated one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perence Shiri is {{a cousin}} of President Robert Mugabe. [...] He has called himself Black Jesus, because {{according}} to an anonymous claim on BBC Panorama documentary [...] "The Price of Silence", he [...] "could determine your life like Jesus Christ. [...] He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. [...] So he claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> because he could say if you live or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We look at old {{footage of}} Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin and The Who, and that's really what gets us going. We want music <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again... The stuff {{we listen to}} isn't what's going on today... {{everything}} from Beatles to Zep to Hendrix—everything from that to old Stevie Wonder, James Brown, The Funky Meters—And I like bands that do something different, that aren't afraid to step it up a notch... Radiohead, obviously, and The Flaming Lips, Shudder to Think-- We just play stuff that comes from our hearts. It's all natural." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Preston Burke was originally envisioned as a caucasian, {{to be played}} by Paul Adelstein, who starred in Grey's Anatomy spin-off Private Practice. However, due to his commitment to a film whose shooting dates changed, the actor had to drop out {{at the last moment}} and his character was rethought. Isaiah Washington was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, which eventually went to Patrick Dempsey. Washington later received a callback from Rhimes to play Burke. He commented: [...] "I knew I could never be wrong in my heart about something so good and so genuine. Her writing just seemed very complex, very honest." [...] "I said that I would only do it if I didn't have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> guy on that other medical show who was always struggling with his anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
