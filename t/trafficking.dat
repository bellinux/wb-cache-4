5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human <b>trafficking</b> across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of <b>Trafficking</b> in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human <b>trafficking</b> because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human <b>trafficking.</b> Although Smith said that human <b>trafficking</b> would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human <b>trafficking</b> in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human <b>trafficking.</b> The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human <b>trafficking,</b> {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human <b>trafficking</b> before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human <b>trafficking</b> in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human <b>Trafficking</b> National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human <b>trafficking</b> is less severe than for drug <b>trafficking.</b> The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization.

30|$|Figure  9 a {{also shows}} that ANASS of Uniform-Far <b>traffic</b> for given FUT-H and FUT-L is higher than ANASS of Sine-Wave-Far <b>traffic</b> except for 100  % FUT-H, and ANASS of Uniform-Half-Far/Half-Near <b>traffic</b> for given FUT-H and FUT-L is higher than ANASS of Sine-Wave-Half-Far/Half-Near <b>traffic</b> except for 100  % FUT-H. This {{is caused by the}} {{difference}} in <b>traffic</b> routing through Spine switches in the Uniform <b>traffic</b> case and the Sine-Wave <b>traffic</b> case. As introduced in Section IV.A, in the Uniform <b>traffic</b> case, the <b>traffic</b> rate for each <b>traffic</b> source is fixed. In the Sine-Wave <b>traffic</b> case, the <b>traffic</b> rate at a given time varies as a sine wave, and the <b>traffic</b> rate assigned as the <b>traffic</b> rate for each <b>traffic</b> source is the maximum <b>traffic</b> rate. The <b>traffic</b> rate at a given time can reach the maximum <b>traffic</b> rate during only one fifth of the simulation time. Therefore, for Uniform <b>traffic</b> and Sine-Wave <b>traffic</b> with the same <b>traffic</b> rate for each <b>traffic</b> source, the <b>traffic</b> routing through Spine switches in the Uniform <b>traffic</b> case is higher than that in the Sine-Wave <b>traffic</b> case.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the <b>traffic</b> light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of <b>traffic</b> with minimal delay. Usually fuzzy <b>traffic</b> controllers are optimized to maximize <b>traffic</b> flows/minimize <b>traffic</b> delays under typical <b>traffic</b> conditions. Consequentially, {{these are not}} the optimal <b>traffic</b> controllers under exceptional <b>traffic</b> cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We propose a new fuzzy <b>traffic</b> controller that can optimally control <b>traffic</b> flows under both normal and exceptional <b>traffic</b> conditions. In this system, sensors are placed strategically at incoming and outgoing links (lanes) and the controller utilize the information received from these sensors to make optimal decisions to minimize the <b>traffic</b> delays. A simulator is developed to evaluate the performance of <b>traffic</b> controllers under different conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed <b>traffic</b> controller {{is similar to that of}} conventional fuzzy <b>traffic</b> controllers under normal <b>traffic</b> conditions and is better that of others under abnormal <b>traffic</b> conditions.
