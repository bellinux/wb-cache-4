5|$|Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky {{commented on}} the Manning team's study, stating that small, {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) were {{likely to have been}} tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, gigantic dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} critical acclaim, obtaining {{an aggregate}} score of 81percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised {{the fact that}} the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> simplistic and not much of an improvement over the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12million copies worldwide.|$|E

50|$|Disproportionality - The socialist {{economics}} had {{a disproportionate}} amount of available jobs and manpower. As written by Ljubo Sirc, “… The Soviet Union and other communist countries {{have the worst}} of both worlds: some enterprises or operations <b>are</b> inefficient because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> labour-intensive”.|$|R
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> thinned out. Grant then {{took advantage of the}} situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, {{with the exception of the}} most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, the French {{utilized}} large column formations {{against the}} rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General André-Gaston Prételat, {{found to be}} generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a defence in depth. In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E
5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
5|$|The Menzies {{government}} first publicly {{discussed the}} need for replacing the English Electric Canberra in 1954, only {{a year after the}} RAAF began receiving the bomber. The non-supersonic Canberra lacked radar and electronic countermeasures, all disadvantages based on Korean War experience. The RAAF believed that it needed a new strategic bomber to fulfill the nation's obligations to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia, ANZUS, and SEATO. Air Staff Requirement 36 that year mandated an all-weather attack aircraft by 1959 capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles. A study recommended one of the British V bombers, but Prime Minister Robert Menzies' Minister of Defence Frederick Shedden decided in 1956 that at £1million each <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> expensive.|$|E

5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E

5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> busy with their work, and Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.|$|E
