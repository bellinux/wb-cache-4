5|$|The MSE {{derives from}} an {{approach}} to psychiatry known as descriptive psychopathology or descriptive phenomenology, which developed {{from the work of}} the philosopher and psychiatrist Karl Jaspers. From Jaspers' perspective it was assumed {{that the only way to}} comprehend a patient's experience is through his or her own description (through an approach of empathic and non-theoretical enquiry), as distinct from an interpretive or psychoanalytic approach which assumes <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> might understand experiences or processes of which the patient is unaware, such as defense mechanisms or unconscious drives.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:30p.m. EST on December 31, 1995, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The game's {{officials}} {{were from the}} Atlantic Coast Conference. Michael Dover was the referee, William Wampler was the umpire, and Sam Stephenson was the linesman. A capacity crowd of 70,283 people attended the game, which was televised by the American Broadcasting Company. The crowd was the smallest to attend a Sugar Bowl in the Superdome to that point. Mark Jones was the play-by-play announcer for the broadcast, Todd Blackledge was <b>the</b> <b>analyst,</b> and Dean Blevins was the sideline reporter. Approximately 6,041,700 American households watched the broadcast, giving it a television rating of 6.3.|$|E

40|$|Context: Elicitation {{effectiveness}} {{depends on}} non-wellunderstood analyst?s skills and abilities. Identifying which analysts? characteristics have stronger influence on elicitation {{may help to}} improve requirements quality. Objective: Identify <b>the</b> <b>analysts?</b> characteristics that influence on the elicitation effectiveness. Method: We analyzed the impact of: <b>the</b> <b>analyst?s</b> experience in interviews, elicitation and requirements; their academic qualifications, the familiarity with problem domain and the time spent during the elicitation session in {{the effectiveness of the}} elicitation and subsequent consolidation of requirements, using a quasi-experiment. Results: The knowledge of the problem domain, <b>the</b> <b>analysts?</b> academic qualifications and the elicitation time do not appear to influence the effectiveness of the elicitation sessions. <b>The</b> <b>analyst?s</b> experience exerts a slight negative influence on the effectiveness of the elicitation session. <b>The</b> <b>analyst?s</b> experience and familiarity with problem domain adversely affect the consolidation process. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>analyst?s</b> academic qualifications have a strong positive impact(statistically significant) on the effectiveness of the consolidation process. Conclusions: Although the evidence is still scarce, it seems <b>the</b> <b>analyst's</b> confidence on his own experience may be harmful in some cases. Specific training in software requirements may yield much higher gains than non-specific analyst experience...|$|R

40|$|The Use of an Object and Relating through Identifications” (1968) {{represents}} Donald Winnicott’s {{theoretical and}} clinical legacy.

He reflects upon the dramatic quality of risks inherent in the processes linked {{to the use of the}} object with seriously disturbed patients. He explores different meanings of <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> survival, linking it to <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> response. <b>The</b> processes of the use of the object—that is, the encounter between the patient’s potential destructiveness and <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> capacity to respond through his own judicious subjectivity—let the patient experience <b>the</b> <b>analyst’s</b> capacity to keep his own subjectivity, authenticity, and creativity alive.

25|$|Insight-oriented psychotherapies {{focus on}} {{revealing}} or interpreting unconscious processes.

25|$|The neo-Freudians, a group {{including}} Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, rejected Freud's {{theory of}} instinctual drive, emphasized interpersonal relations and self-assertiveness, and made modifications to therapeutic practice that reflected these theoretical shifts. Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect {{due to his}} inability to systematically formulate his ideas. Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> and less on exploration of the unconscious.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{division}} by zero is division {{where the}} divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a/0 where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, {{as there is}} no number which, multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a≠0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a/0 is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in <b>The</b> <b>Analyst</b> ("ghosts of departed quantities").|$|E

25|$|Although Schenker himself usually {{presents}} his analyses in the generative direction, {{starting from}} the fundamental structure (Ursatz) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, {{starting from the}} score and showing {{how it can be}} reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the Ursatz is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is subjective. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of <b>the</b> <b>analyst.</b> The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.|$|E
25|$|The {{country and}} {{territory}} ratings were proposed by <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> responsible for each related report.

The ratings were compared to the previous year's findings, and any major proposed numerical shifts or category changes were subjected to more intensive scrutiny. These reviews were followed by cross-regional assessments in which efforts were made to ensure comparability and consistency in the findings. Many of the key country reports were also reviewed by the academic advisers.|$|E
25|$|A “full spectrum” {{analysis}} considers all the “peaks” {{within a}} spectrum. Conversely, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected ions {{associated with a}} specific substance. This is done {{on the assumption that}} at a given retention time, a set of ions is characteristic of a certain compound. This is a fast and efficient analysis, especially if <b>the</b> <b>analyst</b> has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured, but the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.|$|E
