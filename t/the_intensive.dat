5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E

Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of automatic signalling and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, watering, and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout that reduced turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called <b>the</b> <b>Intensive</b> Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E
5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the most important in these days.|$|E

5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and putting it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> bombing of the city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} {{critically}} review our criteria for elective admission to <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> care unit following adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Materials and methods: We reviewed 122 children electively admitted between 1997 and 2011. During this time, our {{criteria for admission}} evolved. Results: In these 122 children, the respiratory disturbance index during {{rapid eye movement sleep}} ranged from 6 to 159 (mean, 83). Forty-one per cent of the children had a recognised co-morbidity. Nine children required extra intervention, i. e. in addition to re-positioning and/or supplemental oxygen. One child was an unplanned re-admission after discharge from <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> care unit. Over the same period, five children required unplanned transfers into <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> care unit following adenotonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Conclusion: Based upon these results, we describe our current criteria for elective admission to <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> care unit following adenotonsillectomy for severe obstructive sleep apnoea...|$|R
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care, close observation {{and treatment of}} abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E

Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length.

5|$|Throughout its history, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade center; it was an enterpot of obsidian trade during the Chalcolithic, as it was situated on the river crossing between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings were empty within three kilometers. This was probably due to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> cultivation in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell inlays.
