50|$|Dating {{back to the}} 1940s till date, <b>T-even</b> phages are {{considered}} the best studied model organisms. Model organisms are usually required to be simple with as few as five genes. Yet, <b>T-even</b> phages are in fact among the largest and highest complexity virus, in which these phages genetic information {{is made up of}} around 160 genes. Coincident with their complexity, <b>T-even</b> viruses were found to have an unimaginable feature of no other, the presence of the unusual base hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) in place of the nucleic acid base cytosine. In addition to this, the HMC residues on the <b>T-even</b> phage are glucosylated in a specific pattern. This unique feature allowed the formation of new enzymes that never existed in <b>T-even</b> infected cells or any other cell and modifying <b>T-even</b> phage DNA provided a basic underlying advancement in viral and molecular levels. Other unique features of the <b>T-even</b> virus is its regulated gene expression. These unique features and other features gave significance of the <b>T-even</b> phages, this includes transduction which is responsible for transfer of drug resistant features, lysogenic conversion is responsible for acquisition of new characteristics such as the formation of new enzymes, random insertion into bacterial chromosome can induce insertional mutation, epidemiological typing of bacteria (phage typing), phages are used extensively in genetic engineering where they serve as cloning vectors. Libraries of genes and monoclonal antibodies are maintained in phages. In addition to all this they are responsible for natural removal of bacteria from water bodies.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of two novel Pseudomonas putida phages, pf 16 and phiPMW. Pf 16 represents a peripherally related T 4 -like phage, and {{is the first of}} its kind infecting a Pseudomonad, with evidence suggesting cyanophage origins. Extensive divergence has resulted in pf 16 occupying a newly defined clade designated as the pf 16 -related phages, lying at the interface of the Schizo <b>T-Evens</b> and Exo <b>T-Evens.</b> Recombination with an ancestor of the P. putida phage AF is likely responsible for the tropism of this phage. phiPMW represents a completely novel Pseudomonas phage with a genome containing substantial genetic novelty through its many hypothetical proteins. Evidence suggests that this phage has been extensively shaped through gene transfer events and vertical evolution. Phylogenetics shows that this phage has an evolutionary history involving FelixO 1 -related viruses but is in itself highly distinct from this group...|$|R
40|$|Tailed bacteriophages are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities in marine environments. However, most of these marine phages are uncharacterized because few of their hosts have been cultivated. To learn more about such phages, we designed a set of degenerate PCR primers for phage T 4 g 23, which encodes the major capsid protein {{in all of the}} T 4 -type phages, an important family of the tailed phage. These primers were used to amplify g 23 -related sequences from diverse marine environments (fjords and bays of British Columbia, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the western Arctic Ocean) revealing a remarkable level of molecular diversity, which in some cases was correlated with morphological variation of the virions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that although some of these sequences were closely related to well studied subgroups of the T 4 -type phage, such as the <b>T-evens,</b> the majority of them belong to five previously uncharacterized subgroups. These data indicate that the host range of T 4 -type phages is much broader than previously imagined and that the laboratory isolate T 4 belongs to a phage family that is extraordinarily widespread and diverse in the biosphere...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{a number of}} bacteriophages with T 4 -type morphology that propagate in different genera of enterobacteria, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, and Vibrio. Most of these phages had a prolate icosahedral head, a contractile tail, and a genome size that {{was similar to that}} of T 4. A few of them had more elongated heads and larger genomes. All these phages are phylogenetically related, since they each had sequences homologous to the capsid gene (gene 23), tail sheath gene (gene 18), and tail tube gene (gene 19) of T 4. On the basis of the sequence comparison of their virion genes, the T 4 -type phages can be classified into three subgroups with increasing divergence from T 4 : the <b>T-evens,</b> pseudoT-evens, and schizoT-evens. In general, the phages that infect closely related host species have virion genes that are phylogenetically closer to each other than those of phages that infect distantly related hosts. However, some of the phages appear to be chimeras, indicating that, at least occasionally, some genetic shuffling has occurred between the different T 4 -type subgroups. The compilation of a number of gene 23 sequences reveals a pattern of conserved motifs separated by sequences that differ in the T 4 -type subgroups. Such variable patches in the gene 23 sequences may determine the size of the virion head and consequently the viral genome length. This sequence analysis provides molecular evidence that phages related to T 4 are widespread in the biosphere and diverged from a common ancestor in acquiring the ability to infect different host bacteria and to occupy new ecological niches...|$|R

50|$|The ICTV's {{first report}} (1971) {{included}} the genus <b>T-even</b> phages, unassigned to an order, family, or subfamily. The genus was renamed in 1976 to <b>T-even</b> phage group, {{moved into the}} newly created family Myoviridae in 1981. In 1993, it was renamed again to T4-like phages, and was moved into the newly created order Caudovirales in 1998. The next year (1999), it was renamed to T4-like viruses.

50|$|Enterobacteria phage T4 is a {{bacteriophage}} that infects Escherichia coli bacteria. The T4 phage is {{a member}} of the <b>T-even</b> phages, a group including enterobacteriophages T2 and T6. T4 is capable of undergoing only a lytic lifecycle and not the lysogenic lifecycle.|$|E
50|$|Born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, Sternberg {{gained a}} BSc at Brooklyn College, {{followed}} by a master's at Long Island University. In 1969, he received a PhD from Purdue University, Indiana, researching <b>T-even</b> phage head proteins {{under the supervision of}} Sewell Champe.|$|E
50|$|Enterobacteria phage T6 is a {{bacteriophage}} that infects Escherichia coli bacteria. It was one bacteriophage {{that was}} used as a model system in the 1950s in exploring the methods viruses replicate, along with the other <b>T-even</b> bacteriophages: Enterobacteria phage T4 and Enterobacteria phage T2.|$|E
50|$|The first phages {{that were}} studied in detail {{included}} seven that commonly infect E. coli. They were named Type 1 (T1), Type 2 (T2), etc., for easy reference, {{but as it}} happens T2, T4 and T6 are structurally similar (polyhedral head, tail structure and fibres for attaching {{to the surface of}} a bacterium), and this easily recognizable shape is now referred to as the <b>T-Even</b> phage.|$|E
50|$|Phages have {{multiple}} {{factors contributing to}} their structure. It consists of the head, collar, helical sheath, the core or tube, hexagonal base plate, tail fibers (not all) and finally tail pins. The head’s job is to enfold or surround nucleic acids. The tail fiber’s help in attaching the phage to a bacterial cell. The tail acts as a duct through which the nucleic acid goes through during an infection.so The collar helps support the head (to stay in place).Bacteriophages in general (including <b>T-even</b> bacteriophages) contain a head structure, which can vary in size and shape. The head enfolds nucleic acid and acts as the protective covering. Certain phages have tails attached to the phage head. The tail is a hollow duct through which the nucleic acid passes during infection. <b>T-even</b> Bacteriophages have genomes that code for phage-specific DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair functions. Also, they offer well branded genes and proteins. Similar to all viruses, they depend on many of their hosts important makeups and roles or functions (transcription and translation, membranes, breakdown of energy etc.), for their reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{like all}} other viruses, <b>T-even</b> phages don't just {{randomly}} attach {{to the surface of}} their host; instead they [...] "search" [...] and bind to receptors, specific protein structures, found {{on the surface of the}} host. These receptors vary with the phage; teichoic acid, cell wall proteins and lipopolysaccharides, flagella, and pili all can serve as receptors for the phage to bind to. In order for the <b>T-even</b> phage to infect its host and begin its life cycle it must enter the first process of infection, adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell. Adsorption is a value characteristic of phage-host pair and the adsorption of the phage on host cell surface is illustrated as a 2-stage process: reverrsible and irreversible. It involves the phages tail structure that begins when the phages tail fibers helps bind the phage to the appropriate receptor of its host. This process is reversible. One or more of the components of the base plate mediates irreversible process of binding of the phage to a bacterium.|$|E
50|$|The T4 Holin Family (TC# 1.E.8) is a {{group of}} {{putative}} pore-forming proteins that does not belong to one of the seven holin superfamilies. <b>T-even</b> phage such as T4 use a holin-endolysin system for host cell lysis. Although the endolysin of phage T4 encoded by the e gene (Lysozyme E) was identified in 1961, the holin (product of gene t and called T-holin) was not characterized until 2001. A representative list of proteins belonging to the T4 holin family {{can be found in the}} Transporter Classification Database.|$|E
5000|$|<b>T-even</b> phages, {{also known}} as the E. coli phages, are a group of {{double-stranded}} bacteriophages from the family Myoviridae. Bacteriophage means to [...] "eat bacteria", and phages are well known for being obligate intracellular parasites that reproduce within the host cell and are released when the host is destroyed by lysis. Containing about 160 genes, these virulent viruses are among the largest, most complex viruses that are known {{and one of the best}} studied model organisms. They have played a key role in the development of virology and molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of these genes places the adenoviruses (Adenoviridae), bacteriophages (Caudovirales) and the plant and fungal linear plasmids into a single clade. A second clade includes the alpha- and delta-like viral Pol from insect ascovirus (Ascoviridae), mammalian herpesviruses (Herpesviridae), fish lymphocystis disease virus (Iridoviridae) and chlorella virus (Phycoviridae). The pol genes of the African swine fever virus (Asfarviridae), baculoviruses (Baculoviridae), fish herpesvirus (Herpesviridae), <b>T-even</b> bacteriophages (Myoviridae) and poxviruses (Poxviridae) were not clearly resolved. A second study showed that poxvirus, baculovirus and the animal herpesviruses form separate and distinct clades. Their relationship to the Asfarviridae and the Myoviridae was not examined and remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Cornell, George under- took graduate {{studies in the}} genetics of <b>T-even</b> coliphage with S. E. Luria in the Bacteriology Department of the University of Illinois. His studies revealed phenotypic mixing, in which a phage with a host-range genotype of one phage type {{was found in a}} particle who was phenotypically dissimilar. When published in 1956, these studies had profound impact on the study of viral biology. During his postdoc at Caltech, with Jean Weigle, he undertook further studies on T2 × T4 hybrids, which led to the discovery of DNA modification (by glucosylation). At the University of Oregon, Streisinger pioneered the study of zebrafish in his lab. Zebrafish can be genetically modified easily, and researchers can modify them to mimic the traits of certain diseases. In analyzing these created diseases, scientists seek solutions to diseases which affect humans. Over 5,000 researchers in 450 labs throughout 31 countries study zebrafish, and many of them received their initial training at the University of Oregon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractP 2 prophages {{have been}} known to inhibit DNA {{replication}} and growth of <b>T-even</b> phages. We show here that this inhibition is due to poisoning of the <b>T-even</b> single-stranded DNA binding protein gp 32 by the product of the nonessential P 2 tingene. Synthesis of Tin protein from a gene cloned in a multicopy plasmid is necessary and sufficient to completely preventde novoDNA replication and growth of wild-type T 2 or T 4 phage. We isolated more than 20 independent mutants that render <b>T-even</b> phages resistant to poisoning by the P 2 Tin protein. In all of these mutants, which we callasp,Asp codon 163 of gene 32 is changed to a Gly or Asn codon. The mutant alleles are recessive; i. e., when wild-type andaspmutants coinfect the same host cells, most DNA replication is poisoned by P 2 Tin protein. To explain our results, we propose that the P 2 Tin protein interacts with <b>T-even</b> gp 32 at position 163 and distorts the helical filament of gene 32 protein on single-stranded DNA. Thereby Tin protein inhibits either assembly or function, or both, of the T 4 replisome. The inhibition of late gene expression by P 2 Tin protein may be an indirect consequence of inhibition of DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|We study electroweak baryogenesis {{within the}} {{framework}} of the littlest Higgs model with T parity. This model has shown characteristics of a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, which is conducive to baryogenesis in the early Universe. In the T parity symmetric theory, there are two gauge sectors, viz., the <b>T-even</b> and the T-odd ones. We observe that the effect of the T-parity symmetric interactions between the T-odd and the <b>T-even</b> gauge bosons on gauge-higgs energy functional is quite small, so that these two sectors can be taken to be independent. The <b>T-even</b> gauge bosons behave like the Standard Model gauge bosons, whereas the T-odd ones are instrumental in stabilizing the Higgs mass. For the T-odd gauge bosons in the symmetric and asymmetric phases and for the <b>T-even</b> gauge bosons in the asymmetric phase, we obtain, using the formalism of Arnold and McLerran, very small values of the ratio, (Baryon number violation rate/Universe expansion rate). We observe that this result, in conjunction with the scenario of inverse phase transition in the present work and the value of the ratio obtained from the lattice result of sphaleron transition rate in the symmetric phase, can provide us with a plausible baryogenesis scenario.

40|$|Phleomycin (PM) induces rapid {{solubilization}} of {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA), inhibition of cellular mass increase, {{and loss of}} viability when added either to growing cultures of Escherichia coli B or an endonuclease I-defective derivative of B. Nonetheless, bacteriophage of the <b>T-even</b> series are produced, albeit to a reduced extent, when PM is added with phage or after infection to E. coli cells. Bacteriophage T 4 infection inhibits the ability of PM {{to bring about the}} solubilization of DNA; this effect appears to account for most of the resistance of <b>T-even</b> phage replication to PM. The patterns of inhibition of phage yields obtained when PM is added at infection suggest that glucosylation of <b>T-even</b> phage DNA may also have a protective effect. However, PM induces the solubilization of glucosylated and nonglucosylated DNA at approximately the same rate and thermal denaturation studies indicate that the antibiotic binds both types of DNA equally well.

40|$|For Escherichia coli {{cells that}} have been {{infected}} by <b>T-even</b> bacteriophages (phages T 2, T 4, and T 6), the adsorption of a second <b>T-even</b> phage results {{in an increase in}} the length of the original phage infection and an ssociated {{increase in the number of}} phages produced by the same infected cell.

These mutants adsorb <b>T-even</b> phages but are unable to release viable progeny. Under certain conditions, viability of the cells is completely unaffected by phage infection in one mutant, and there is but a slight decrease in colony-forming ability in the other. Phage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is injected into these cells, {{as shown by the}} formation of phage-specific enzymes, but it is not degraded to acid-soluble material. Some phage DNA replication occurs in both strains. The mutants are both more resistant to ultraviolet light than is the parent strain...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli B/r and Bs− 1 ceased {{division}} and increased in {{mean cell volume}} soon after infection with <b>T-even</b> phage. The effect was obtained with wild-type or rapid lysis mutants, {{as well as with}} ultraviolet light-killed phage and with bacteriophage ghosts which lack deoxyribonucleic acid. The cell response did not require the presence of phage genetic material or the production of progeny phage. A Poisson distribution of the fraction of adsorbed phage at different multiplicites of infection indicates that one phage per bacterium will produce maximum increase in cell volume. <b>T-even</b> phage-resistant E. coli mutants showed no enlargement response, and phage T 1, T 3, and T 7 elicited neither abrupt termination of cell division nor host cell enlargement. Infection with baseplate-defective T 4 D 12 − amber mutants, which bind reversibly to but do not penetrate the bacterium, also had no effect. In vitro restoration of normal baseplate function in these defective viruses allowed phage adsorption and penetration and caused host cell division arrest and enlargement.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of several bacteriophages (including phages U 2 and LB related to <b>T-even</b> phages of Escherichia coli) that grow both on E. coli K 12 and on some Salmonella strains. Such phages were termed {{ambivalent}}. <b>T-even</b> ambivalent phages (U 2 and LB) are rare and have {{a limited number of}} hosts among Salmonella strains. U 2 and LB are similar to canonical E. coli-specific <b>T-even</b> phages in morphological type and size of the phage particle and in reaction with specific anti-T 4 serum. Phages U 2 and LB have identical sets of structural proteins, some of which are similar in size to structural proteins of phages T 2 and T 4. DNA restriction patterns of phages U 2 and LB differ from each other and from those of T 2 and T 4. Still, DNAs of all four phages have considerable homology. Unexpectedly, phages U 2 and LB grown on Salmonella bungori were unstable during centrifugation in a CsCl gradient. Ambivalent bacteriophages were found in species other than <b>T-even</b> phages and were similar in morphotype to lambdoid and other E. coli phages. One of the ambivalent phages was highly similar to well-known Felix 01, which is specific for Salmonella. Ambivalent phages can be used to develop a new set for phage typing in Salmonella. An obvious advantage is that ambivalent phages can be reproduced in the E. coli K 12 laboratory strain, which does not produce active temperate phages. Consequently, the resulting typing phage preparation is devoid of an admixture of temperate phages, which are common in Salmonella. The presence of temperate phages in phage-typing preparations may cause false-positive results in identifying specific Salmonella strains isolated from the environment or salmonellosis patients. Ambivalent phages are potentially useful for phage therapy and prevention of salmonellosis in humans and animals...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli cells {{treated with}} toluene {{replicate}} DNA {{when they are}} provided with deoxyribonucleoside 5 ′-triphosphates, ATP, Mg++, and K+. However, when deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate is replaced by hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate, incorporation of nucleotides into acid-precipitable material by toluenetreated strains restrictive to nonglucosylated <b>T-even</b> phage is reduced to less than 5 % of that normally observed. Even when dCTP {{is present in the}} reaction mixture, a similar effect of the hydroxymethyl analogue on DNA replication is observed. In contrast, toluene-treated E. coli K 12 r 6 -r 2, 4 -, a strain permissive to the nonglucosylated <b>T-even</b> phage, incorporates hydroxymethyl deoxycytosine into its DNA, and replication proceeds at only a slightly reduced rate {{in the presence of the}} hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate. The presence of the hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate in the reaction mixture does not lead to degradation of preexisting DNA of the restrictive host, but it does lead to an irreversible inhibition of further DNA replication; the inhibition is observed only when the hydroxymethyl deoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate is present during replication. Thus phage-specific enzymes are not necessary for the incorporation of hydroxymethylcytosine into phage DNA, and the restrictive mechanism, present in the host cell before infection, can recognize hydroxymethylcytosine residues in its own DNA, as well as the DNA of the <b>T-even</b> phage...|$|E
