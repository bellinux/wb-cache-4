5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|As {{the urban}} area {{continued}} to expand, much of rural Scarborough was converted <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> housing {{developments in the}} last third of the 20th century. At the start of the 21st century, growth occurred along the Highway 401 corridor at the northern end of the Scarborough RT; highrise condominium projects have increased the residential density around Scarborough City Centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the inner}} city, {{motorised}} traffic is highly regulated, larger parts are pedestrianised {{and in the}} 2000s, a system of roads prioritised for cyclists have been implemented, connecting <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> areas. Aarhus Light Rail, a system of electric tram-trains and {{the first of its}} kind in Denmark, is expected to open at some point in 2017.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. The Cumberland station became particularly attractive <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> commuters from Des Plaines and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in the Cumberland and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. The influx of suburban commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} species {{that causes the}} most damage to bird populations is the cat (Felis catus), both domestic and feral. Cats that are let outside live close <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> populations and have been estimated to number 640per square mile. In such close numbers in historic migratory areas, they have devastating effects on migratory bird populations.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used modes of local transport in Tiruchirappalli are the state government-owned Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses, and auto rickshaws.

5|$|The {{population}} of South Bend declined after 1960, {{when it had}} a peak {{population of}} 132,445. This was chiefly due to migration <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> areas {{as well as the}} demise of Studebaker and other heavy industry. Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations include Crowe Horwath, Honeywell, and AM General.|$|E
5|$|Metrorail {{serves the}} urban core of Miami, {{connecting}} the urban centers of Miami International Airport, the Civic Center, Downtown Miami, and Brickell {{with the northern}} developed neighborhoods of Hialeah and Medley to the northwest, and <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> The Roads, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, and South Miami, ending at urban Dadeland in Kendall. Metrorail connects to the Metromover in Downtown, which provides metro service to the entirety of Downtown and Brickell. Additionally, it connects to South Florida's commuter rail system at Tri-Rail Station, as well as Metrobus routes at all stations. Together with Metromover, the system has seen steady ridership growth per annum, {{with an average of}} 105,500 daily passengers in 2013.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the county line, I-75 begins to run inland of, and {{parallel}} to, the Detroit River, entering the Downriver area. The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with M-85 (Fort Street) near Gibraltar, and the LECT departs I-75 to follow M-85 north of the interchange. The landscape transitions <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> residential areas instead of farmland through this area. The freeway turns back northeasterly in Taylor and intersects the southern end of M-39 (Southfield Highway) in Lincoln Park. I-75 crosses the Ecorse River and passes through an industrial area of Metro Detroit. Further north, the freeway spans the River Rouge in the southern part of Detroit.|$|E

5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels <b>to</b> <b>Suburban</b> Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As {{the highway}} transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural <b>to</b> <b>suburban.</b> North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway {{on the outskirts}} of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East Beltline Avenue begins. This same intersection also marks the western terminus of M-44, which starts concurrent with M-37 in Kentwood. These two highway designations follow East Beltline Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of the malls, M-37/M-44 passes through the campus of Calvin College and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37/M-44 meets I-96.|$|E

5|$|The Cumberland {{station was}} first {{proposed}} in 1972 {{as part of}} an extension of the Blue Line from Logan Square to O'Hare International Airport. The station opened on February 27, 1983, along with Harlem and Rosemont. The three new stations brought 6,000 new riders to the northwest CTA line in the following month, and Cumberland became especially attractive <b>to</b> <b>suburban</b> commuters. The station at Cumberland consists of a single island platform; a pedestrian overpass connects the platform to a station building to the south and an exit stairway to the north. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Trains serve Cumberland 24 hours a day every day; the headway between trains is 10 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. In addition to trains, Cumberland also serves CTA buses, Pace buses, Burlington Trailways buses, and Greyhound buses.|$|E
