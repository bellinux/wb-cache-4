40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Historic {{changes that}} have taken place on Oregon's {{commercial}} salmon fisheries are described in terms of their effects on the efficiency of fishermen. This historical analysis provides a background for comparative efficiency studies of Columbia River gillnetters and ocean <b>trollers</b> with the objective of determining which harvester group was more efficient and whether their method of fishing fully utilized the harvest potential of the resource. Changes in efficiency for gilinetters on the Columbia River are reflected by the modernization of their fishing technology and the trend of management for increasing gillnetting restrictions. Concurrent changes in technology for ocean <b>trollers</b> are observed and provide a base for the study of a comparative vessel efficiency between gilinetters and <b>trollers.</b> The effect of the different harvesting methods upon the resource reflects differences in harvesting efficiency between gillnetters and <b>trollers.</b> The lower harvesting efficiency among <b>trollers</b> is shown to partially limit the harvest potential of Columbia River chinook salmon. Evolutionary trends in salmon fishery management have tended to decrease efficiencies for fishermen and to favor less efficient resource use by more people. Low levels of present fishermen efficiency characterized by declining vessel and harvest efficiency may result in reducing or limiting fishing effort in Oregon's future fisheries. The socioeconomic implications of such future restrictions require that management strategies incorporate new concepts of restricting the fishery for both efficiency and conservation purposes...|$|R
500|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Vives under the executive production of his wife, Claudia Elena Vasquez. The recording of Pombo Musical took two years in four music studios in Colombia. The album comprises songs {{from a variety of}} Colombian folk genres like vallenato, bambuco, joropo and cumbia. Some songs mix genres such as Latin pop and pop rock. Opening track, [...] "El Modelo Alfabético" [...] ("The Model Alphabetical"), is a rock-stylized cumbia and vallenato song performed by Vives, the Dúo Huellas, Eduardo Arias and Karl <b>Troller,</b> about being a real gentleman, such as having good manners, and also teaches the alphabet to children. [...] "El Renacuajo Paseador" [...] ("The Tadpole Walker"), is a bambuco song performed by Andrea Echeverri, Lucia Pulido, Iván Benavides, Carlos Ivan Medina, Bernardo Velasco, Ernesto Ocampo, Dúo Huellas, Fundación Batuta Chorus, and Vives. It tells the story about a tadpole named [...] "Rin Rin", that left his home without the approval of his mother [...] "Rana" [...] ("Frog"), and subsequently dies when he hides in the mouth of a duck. In this song, Echeverri added additional lines to it. Juanes performs on [...] "El Gato Bandido" [...] ("The Bandit Cat"), a pop rock song about a cat that rebels against his family and leaves home, discovering that things are not easy by yourself, and returns feeling repentant. Aterciopelados performs on [...] "Mirringa Mirronga", which is about a feline mega-party.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "trolley" [...] predates the {{invention}} of the trolley pole. The earliest electric cars did not use a pole, but rather a system in which each tramcar dragged behind it an overhead cable connected to a small cart – or [...] "troller" [...] – [...] that rode on a [...] "track" [...] of overhead wires. From the side, the dragging lines made the car seem to be [...] "trolling", as in fishing. If the <b>troller</b> cart were to derail from the overhead wire, it would fall with a loud crash onto the roof of the tramcar and be troublesome to reposition; these drawbacks prompted a search for better ways to connect to the power wire. Later, when a pivoted pole replaced the <b>troller,</b> it {{came to be known as}} a [...] "trolley pole".|$|E

Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer, <b>Troller,</b> and Australian performance car manufacturer FPV. In the past, it has also produced tractors and automotive components. Ford owns an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 49% stake in Jiangling of China.

2500|$|Credit for {{development}} of the first working trolley pole is given to Charles Joseph Van Depoele, a Belgian engineer {{who moved to the}} United States in 1869. [...] Van Depoele made the first public demonstration of the spring-loaded device on a temporary streetcar line installed at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (now the CNE) in autumn 1885. [...] Depoele's first trolley pole was [...] "crude" [...] and not very reliable, and he reverted to using the <b>troller</b> system of current collection for a commercial installation on a streetcar system in South Bend, Indiana, which opened on November 14, 1885, and on one in Montgomery, Alabama, in April 1886. However, within a few months, Van Depoele switched to the trolley-pole system for the Montgomery operation. [...] Van Depoele and fellow inventor Frank J. Sprague were [...] "working on similar ideas at about the same time", and Sprague employed trolley-pole current collection on an electric streetcar system he installed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, also improving the trolley wheel and pole designs. [...] Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E
5000|$|One notable case {{is said to}} {{frequent}} a remote gorge named <b>Troller's</b> Gill in England. A ballad entitled [...] "The Legend of the <b>Troller's</b> Gill" [...] {{can be found in}} William Hone's Everyday Book (1830). It recounts the tale of a man who ventures forth [...] "to the horrid gill of the limestone hill" [...] in order to summon and confront the Barghest in an act of ritual magic. The man's lifeless body is discovered soon after with inhuman marks upon his breast. There is also a story of a Barghest entering the city of York occasionally where, according to legend, it preys on lone travellers in the city's narrow Snickelways. Whitby is also associated with the spectre.|$|R
25|$|<b>Trollers</b> – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} {{trolling}} lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. <b>Trollers</b> range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built <b>trollers</b> are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.|$|R
