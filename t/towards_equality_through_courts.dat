40|$|With {{the tumult}} {{of the first}} years of the twenty-first century, from {{prosperity}} to banking crisis, it is easy to lose sight of the institutions, besides the economy, which form our society. Further, the focus on money shifts the construction of values from society and citizenship to consumption, growth and expenditure. This book re-directs the focus to the pivotal social institution that shapes the lives of every member of society, namely, education, without which the social good could not be achieved. Maria Slowey and Hans Schuetze revisit their earlier publication of 2000, to explore the changes if any, to the social contract <b>towards</b> <b>equality</b> <b>through</b> education. This publication provides an invaluable resource that enables us to contextualise the issues with the comparative global perspectives. In particular, it integrates lifelong learning with higher education, an undertaking crucial for adult educators with our interest in post-compulsory education along the lifespan, access and equality...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} stance that {{globalization}} and neoliberalism have dramatically altered gender relations in Mexico. Women’s increased {{access to the}} paid labor force has caused conflicts and a demand for the revision of traditional gender relations. From this background, I examine women’s organizing <b>towards</b> gender <b>equality</b> <b>through</b> a case study conducted at a confederation of independent labor unions called Frente Auténtico del Trabajo (the Authentic Labor Front, FAT) in Mexico City. The thesis explores the relations between these women’s movements and concepts of strategic gender interests, citizenship construction, and gender equality within the still largely patriarchal culture of Mexico. Moreover, women’s and men’s attitudes towards and possible obstacles in achieving gender equality and a gender perspective at FAT are extensively discussed and related to the above-mentioned theoretical concepts. The inclusion of men in gender equality issues is also considered. The research was conducted through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and literature collection. My theoretical standpoint is that women are developing strategic gender interests as they realize they are being marginalized, which leads to their organizing towards a gender perspective. With their organizing they are engaging {{in the development of}} a more democratic citizenship that takes into account women’s interests. I also argue that men should be actively included in gender issues at FAT, in order for the gender perspective to be successful...|$|R
40|$|Armed forces has {{historically}} been, {{and is still}} today, an essential actor in peacekeeping. Armed forces provides peacekeeping missions with the aim to provide stability and security in war-torn areas. Despite the mission’s aim, sexual transgressions by soldiers have been reported. Victims of these transgressions have been both soldiers and locals from the areas where the soldiers were supposed to provide stability and security. As a consequence of these revelations, a debate arose concerning the suitability of using armed forces for peacekeeping missions. The debate {{has been dominated by}} feminist scholars, who questioned for whom security is provided, if it is provided by the armed forces. Feminist scholars have highlighted the traditional understanding of the armed forces as carriers of destructive masculinity norms. With a point of departure in this debate, this study seeks to examine and understand gendered norms within the Swedish Armed Forces with the aim to understand if the views of Swedish peacekeepers gender relations and equality is compatible with keeping peace. This study is conducted as a single case study, based on semi-structured interviews. The central findings of this research concern the Swedish Armed Forces’ views and strategy on gender equality and how the male and female soldiers perceive and have experienced gender relations and equality. Lastly this research identifies some challenges for the work with gender equality within the Swedish Armed Forces. The study concludes that the Swedish Armed Forces work <b>towards</b> gender <b>equality</b> <b>through</b> gender neutrality. Even if there has been major work put into the area of equality, there is still evidence of gender-based discrimination and views upon gender relations and equality which does not correlate with the organisations vision of an equal organisation...|$|R

40|$|The last {{section of}} the book offers lessons for action. Rinie van Est, a staff member at the Dutch {{parliamentary}} technology assessment organization, the Rathenau Institute, proposes {{that the notion of}} moving <b>towards</b> equity and <b>equality</b> <b>through</b> nanotechnology is as big a vision as the visions of technological transformation put forth by many nano-advocates. In order to move {{in the direction of the}} vision, van Est argues for three important steps. First, we must reflect on emerging equity and quality issues early in the development of new technologies rather than after they are produced. Van Est challenges researchers to develop constructive suggestions to strengthen equity and equality. Second, we need to mobilize the public rather than wait for people to get interested in nanotechnology. Van Est envisions people of all walks of life weighing in on what they want our nano-enabled future to be. To make this possible we need to stimulate public participation on many levels, including the active engagement of civil society organizations and experts like social scientists, policy makers, and politicians. Third, and perhaps most important for this volume, van Est encourages ELSI-researchers to play a more active role in the public and political debate so their insights may have a larger impact in society. Publishing in academic journals... or even Yearbooks... may not reach a sufficient audience to make change possible. To further the cause of equity in a meaningful way, academe needs to connect with the larger world. —eds...|$|R

GLEN again strongly supported this development but also expressed concern about the absence of any provision in the Bill to provide legal support and recognition of the many children being parented by same-sex couples. At this time GLEN published three documents to inform both policy makers and the LGBT community about the Civil Partnership Bill. These were: ...|$|R

40|$|Electoral {{redistribution}} (redistricting) is {{a process}} that has the potential to advance the principle of "one vote, one value" in the face of dynamic human populations. Using the Australian federal electoral system as a case study, this article examines the impact of changes in the size, composition and spatial distribution of the population on electoral boundary delimitation over the past 110 years, and analyses the likely impact of future population change over the next forty years. The article concludes that the Australian electoral system has moved progressively <b>towards</b> greater <b>equality</b> of voting power encapsulated by the "one vote, one value" principle. However, the capacity to achieve even greater <b>equality</b> <b>through</b> electoral redistribution is constrained by constitutional and pragmatic considerations. 23 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this essay is to investigate how attitudes <b>towards</b> <b>equality</b> {{between men and women}} affect the gender wage gap. The essay studies how positive and negative attitudes on gender equality affects the gender income gap. This study investigates this by using data of the mean yearly incomes from 290 municipalities in Sweden during the years 2000 - 2008. Additionally, using a survey conducted by the SOM-institute at the Gothenburg university to measure attitudes <b>towards</b> gender <b>equality.</b> The results indicate that positive attitudes <b>towards</b> gender <b>equality</b> had a decreasing effect on the gender wage gap. A conclusion from this essay is that a more egalitarian attitude contributes to a decrease in the existing gender wage gap. ...|$|R

40|$|All {{advances}} in social equity are predicated on two important considerations: First, an internal drive emoting {{from those who}} benefit most directly from a greater stride <b>towards</b> <b>equality,</b> and second, the external forces relevant to {{the context in which}} equity is being sought. The historicopolitical phenomenon of recapturing the momentum towards achieving women‟s rights specifically—and gender equality more generally—is thus best understood from this dual perspective of internal and external agencies. It is argued that the only plausible solution to the quagmire of gender inequality rests not within the confines of internal agency but in the wholesale adoption of progressive societal forces on the periphery. This argument is further supported with a discussion of the paradox of structural disempowerment as a consequence of well-intended yet ill-advised social changes, such as it applies <b>towards</b> <b>equality</b> in education, employment, and sociocultural standing...|$|R

40|$|The {{status of}} Islam in Western {{societies}} remains deeply contentious. Countering strident claims {{on both the}} right and left, Legal Integration of Islam offers an empirically informed analysis of how four liberal democracies—France, Germany, Canada, and the United States—have responded {{to the challenge of}} integrating Islam and Muslim populations. Demonstrating the centrality of the legal system to this process, Christian Joppke and John Torpey reject the widely held notion that Europe is incapable of accommodating Islam and argue that institutional barriers to Muslim integration are no greater {{on one side of the}} Atlantic than the other. While Muslims have achieved a substantial degree of <b>equality</b> working <b>through</b> the <b>courts,</b> political dynamics increasingly push back against these gains, particularly in Europe. From a classical liberal viewpoint, religion can either be driven out of public space, as in France, or included without sectarian preference, as in Germany. But both policies come at a price—religious liberty in France and full equality in Germany. Often seen as the flagship of multiculturalism, Canada has found itself responding to nativist and liberal pressures as Muslims become more assertive. And although there have been outbursts of anti-Islamic sentiment in the United States, the legal and political recognition of Islam is well established and largely uncontested. Legal Integration of Islam brings to light the successes and the shortcomings of integrating Islam through law without denying the challenges that this religion presents for liberal societies...|$|R
