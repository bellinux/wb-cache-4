5|$|Acting on {{a report}} in January 2009, the city council {{recommended}} that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved {{the replacement of the}} steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.|$|E
5|$|Adrift is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Lucius J. Henderson. The film depicts {{a story of a}} young artist whose lack of success leads him to attempt suicide. Before he can carry out the act, his daughter follows and stops him. He confesses to his wife and she thanks her child, providing the inspiration for <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> complete a great painting. It brings him success and he grows distant from his wife and becomes interested in another woman whom he was commissioned by. Once again saved by his daughters actions, whose crying moves the woman to break off the relationship with the artist. The artist destroys the painting and learns a moral lesson.|$|E
5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to be placed on the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> his craft and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E

5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by the Publishers Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot and is in graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Jolin and Isaac Grünewald left Sweden for {{the vibrant}} life in Paris and its art community. The Swedish painter, graphic artist and {{forester}} Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse and helped <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> find a suitable {{location for the}} new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy. Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their friends from Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils. At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with bright and clean colours in his paintings.|$|E

5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Dover, Pistrucci had {{difficulty}} with Customs, possibly caused by Bonelli's malice. Once {{he was able}} to, he journeyed to London. He had letters of introduction to several people, and Charles Konig, Keeper of Minerals at the British Museum, proved a loyal friend. Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight came by, anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, and which he dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci's reputation in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> <b>to</b> create a more striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E

Fantasy was used by <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>to</b> portray Greek and Roman mythological subjects and events. 3. Fantasy was used by <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>to</b> present allegorical figures and ideas. 4. Fantasy was used to illustrated dreams or visions. 5.

5|$|International {{recognition}} of Rakoto Frah and his performance of traditional sodina music began {{with his first}} overseas voyage to Algeria in 1967. The artist led a troupe of 18Malagasy musicians selected to represent the island's various ethnic groups at the International Festival of Algiers. Among the 80 competitors hailing {{from a variety of}} countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making him one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the group name Orchestre Nationale. By exposing international audiences to sodina performances, Rakoto Frah promoted the instrument and the traditional musical heritage of Madagascar across the globe. The government of President Tsirananana fell into disfavor and was overturned in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's close association with the unpopular former head of state led <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> be marginalized {{for the first half of}} the administration of his successor, Didier Ratsiraka (1975–1993).|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1880, Tárrega {{replaced}} his friend Luis de Soria, in a concert in Novelda, Alicante, where, after the concert, an important man in town asked <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> listen to his daughter, María José Rizo, who was learning to play guitar.

25|$|Thereafter {{engraving}} {{tended to}} lose ground to etching, {{which was a}} much easier technique for <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>to</b> learn.

By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.|$|E
