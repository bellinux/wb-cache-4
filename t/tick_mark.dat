50|$|At the {{far right}} end of the KM plot there is a <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> at 161 weeks. The {{vertical}} <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> indicates that a patient was censored at this time. In the aml data table five subjects were censored, at 13, 16, 28, 45 and 161 weeks. There are five tick marks in the KM plot, corresponding to these censored observations.|$|E
50|$|The scale {{along the}} top is shared among five {{different}} ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found {{in one of these}} ranges, and the <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.|$|E

5000|$|Step 5. From the {{information}} in Step 4, Otto scans all sums in Table 2 in search for one who among its all 2-splits, only one has a single <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> in Table 1B. The desired one can only have one <b>tick</b> <b>mark,</b> else Sue {{would not have been}} able to know X and Y with certainty. Finally, Otto arrives at the desired sum which also happens to be the only one with these properties, making the original problem solvable with a unique solution. Otto’s task is now done as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{lengths of}} the lines show the {{relative}} distances of the pulsars to the Sun. A <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> {{at the end of}} each line gives the Z coordinate perpendicular to the galactic plane.|$|E
50|$|Step 2. Sue {{now looks}} at her sum and all its 2-splits. She sees that all 2-splits have {{products}} that are not unique, i.e. {{there is at least}} one other multiplication of two numbers that yield the same result. She sees this from the table in Step 1 where all her products have more than one <b>tick</b> <b>mark.</b> She realises that because of this fact, Pete will be unable to uniquely determine the factors X and Y by looking at the product (that would have required at least one of the candidate products to have only one <b>tick</b> <b>mark).</b> Thus she exclaims “P cannot know X and Y”. When Pete and Otto hear this, they get the information that none of the products associated with Sue’s sum are unique. By going through the possible sums, one by one, Sue, Pete, and Otto can now each one by themselves make a list of all eligible sums (Table 2). The table contains those sums whose all 2-splits have products that are non-unique, i.e. have more than one <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> in Table 1. In no time at all, Sue, Pete, and Otto have created the table of candidate sums (Sue of course already knows her sum but needs to trace Pete’s thinking).|$|E

It does not affect white areas that were caused by a/a e/e or M/M or M/m H/h. The colour of the <b>tick</b> <b>marks</b> will be as expected or one shade darker. <b>Tick</b> <b>marks</b> are semi-random, so that they vary from one dog to the next and can overlap, but are generally present on the lower legs and heavily present on the nose.|$|R

50|$|The 101st was {{distinguished}} {{partly by}} its tactical helmet insignia. Card suits (diamonds, spades, hearts, and clubs) {{on each side}} of the helmet denoted the regiment to which a soldier belonged. The only exception was the 187th, who were added to the division later. Divisional headquarters and support units were denoted by use of a square and divisional artillery by a circle. Tick marks at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock indicated to which battalion the individual belonged, while the <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> at 12 o'clock indicated a headquarters or headquarters company assignment.|$|E

For example, 11 can be 2-split into 2+9, 3+8, 4+7, and 5+6. The respective products are 18, 24, 28, and 30 and the players put a <b>tick</b> <b>mark</b> beside each of these products in their tables (Table 1).

5000|$|When {{selecting}} {{an appropriate}} window function for an application, this comparison graph may be useful. The frequency axis has units of FFT [...] "bins" [...] when {{the window of}} length N is applied to data and a transform of length N is computed. For instance, the value at frequency ½ [...] "bin" [...] (third <b>tick</b> <b>mark)</b> is the response that would be measured in bins k and k+1 to a sinusoidal signal at frequency k+½. It is relative to the maximum possible response, which occurs when the signal frequency is an integer number of bins.

The rectangular window is noticeably worse than the others in terms of that metric.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, the 101st Airborne Division {{undertook}} {{steps to}} identify paratroopers from each divisional element visually. As a result, a suit from {{a deck of}} cards was painted on the helmets of the division's four infantry regiments. The helmets of the members of 501st were therefore emblazoned with a white diamond and each respective battalion was indicated with a white <b>tick</b> <b>mark.</b> During the Vietnam War the Diamond as well as the Spade, Heart and Club were used on the helmet by units of the 101st Airborne Division but instead of white it was black {{and most of the time}} a black permanent marker was the only thing needed to apply it. Post Vietnam the tradition carried on through the late 1970's. The modern day members of the 501st resurrected the tradition in 2003 prior to deployment to Afghanistan with two black cloth patches sewn to each side of their helmet covers. The tradition was carried over after the switch to the Army Combat Uniform as part of the Rapid Fielding Initiative in 2006 and again worn in Iraq. The emblem has entered common usage among members of the current battalion outside of helmet insignia, appearing on unit clothing, challenge coins and other souvenirs. A similar insignia has been recently appropriated for use by the current 101st Aviation Brigade to match that of other elements within the 101st Airborne Division which chose to use their original World War II regimental helmet markings. Despite their use of the diamond patches, there is no historical connection between the use of the insignia in World War II and the 101st Aviation Brigade. The brigade links their current use with the use of color-coded diamonds on UH-1s by the unit during Vietnam, when it carried the designation of 101st Aviation Battalion. Although helmet markings are commonly worn by units throughout the Army, The Institute of Heraldry has confirmed they are not authorized by the Army's uniform regulations.|$|E
