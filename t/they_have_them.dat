25|$|Standards {{usually do}} not come with {{fairings}} or windscreens, or if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them,</b> they are relatively small. Standard is often a synonym for naked bike, a term that became popular in the 1990s {{in response to the}} proliferation of fully faired sport bikes. The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling nostalgia for the return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility.|$|E
25|$|Each one has {{at least}} ten or twelve horses, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> so well-trained that they follow them {{wherever}} {{they want to take}} them, and they mount first on one and then on another. When they are on a raid, each horse has a bag hung on his nose, in which his fodder is put, and he feeds as he follows his master, and they do not stop going by night or by day. And they ride so hard that they cover in one day and one night fully six days' journey or seven or eight. And while they are on the way they will not seize anything or carry it along, before their return, but when they are returning, then they seize plunder and make captives and take anything they can get. Nor do they go armed, except that they wear a garment of sheepskin and carry bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|Insights into {{language}} {{storage in}} the brain have come from studying mulilingual individuals afflicted with a form of aphasia. The symptoms and severity of aphasia in multilinguals depend on how many languages the individual knows, what order <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> stored {{in the brain}}, how frequently they use each one, and how proficient they are in using those languages. Two primary theoretical approaches to studying and viewing multilingual aphasics exist—the localizationalist approach and the dynamic approach. The localizationalist approach views different languages as stored in {{different regions of the}} brain, explaining why multilingual aphasics may lose one language they know, but not the other(s). The dynamical theory approach suggests that the language system is supervised by a dynamic equilibrium between the existing language capabilities and the constant alteration and adaptation to the communicative requirements of the environment. The dynamic approach views the representation and control aspects of the language system as compromised as a result of brain damage to the brain's language regions. The dynamic approach offers a satisfactory explanation for the various recovery times of each of the languages the aphasic has had impaired or lost because of the brain damage. Recovery of languages varies across aphasic patients. Some may recover all lost or impaired languages simultaneously. For some, one language is recovered before the others. In others, an involuntary mix of languages occurs in the recovery process; they intermix words from the various languages they know when speaking.|$|E

500|$|The album {{consists}} of 22 songs, {{most of which}} are short, under 3 minutes, and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, [...] "sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field -toting skits". He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V. Club compared the album to a buffet, where [...] "Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them,</b> giving them as much attention as they need, and {{moving on to the next}} thing". Tim O'Neil of PopMatters praised Madlib's instrumentals and said that they [...] "make the album a sonic feast".|$|E
500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and this is our 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon as I said I {{was going to call}} it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They never used to have 13th floors in hotels but now <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E

50|$|The game did utilize {{almost a}} full range of monsters that were {{available}} through Games Workshop’s Warhammer Fantasy range. It was designed so that players could use their range of Warhammer miniatures (if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>them)</b> to represent their monsters.|$|R

Leonard turned to the Collects, and mutely opened at the print of the Son of Consolation, which he had already outlined, looked up at his friend, and turned away, only saying, 'Two or three of the sort with elastic nibs; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> at the post-office.' ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{over the}} hill, in a {{sheltered}} southwest valley, was the North Point church with the graveyard behind it, and this graveyard {{was the most}} beautiful spot in North Point or near it. The North Point folk loved flowers. <b>They</b> could not <b>have</b> <b>them</b> about their homes, so <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>them</b> in their graveyard. It was a matter of pride with each family to keep the separate plot neatly trimmed and weeded and adorned with beautiful blossoms.|$|R

Then, on the second floor--draw it, Dick--you have two nice, large chambers, with plenty of light and air, before and behind. I do miss the light and air in a flat, there's no denying it." ...|$|E

Touching their drunkenness and the trifle of rioting, what soldiers have not these faults? When <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> not, neither have they merit. The man that is tame in times of peace is a skulking woman in times of war. For the rest, whence came the wine they drank? It was of Messer Gonzaga's providing." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were to go}} {{the next}} day to the races, and I woke with more anxiety about the weather than about the lovers, or {{potential}} lovers. But after realising that the day was beautiful, on that large scale of loveliness which seems characteristic of the summer days at Saratoga, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> almost the size of the summer days I knew when I was a boy, I was sensible of a secondary worry in my mind, which presently related itself to Kendricks and Miss Gage. It was a haze of trouble merely, however, such as burns off, like a morning fog, when the sun gets higher, and it was chiefly on my wife's account.|$|E
