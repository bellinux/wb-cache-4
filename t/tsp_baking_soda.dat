40|$|Pre-rinsing unfertilized {{eggs with}} a <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> {{solution}} {{is an effective}} way of countering {{the harmful effects of}} ruptured egg material on fertilization rates but there are problems when using this procedure in large scale fish culture. With large batches of eggs it is difficult to thoroughly decant the final rinse solution so precise control of the amount of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> at fertilization is often impossible. Excess <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> can result in sperm dilution and reduced fertilization. We found that egg mortality increased linearly from 5 % when the sperm dilution was low, to 24 % when the volume of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> was equal to the egg volume at fertilization...|$|R
50|$|When {{added to}} <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> (sodium bicarbonate), {{cyanoacrylate}} glue forms a hard, lightweight adhesive filler (<b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> is first used {{to fill a}} gap then the adhesive is dropped onto the <b>baking</b> <b>soda).</b> This works well with porous materials that do not work well with the adhesive alone. This method is sometimes used by aircraft modelers to assemble or repair polystyrene foam parts. It is also used to repair small nicks in the leading edge of composite propeller blades on light aircraft. The reaction between cyanoacrylate and <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> is very exothermic (heat-producing) and also produces noxious vapors. See Reaction with cotton and wool below.|$|R
30|$|In the experiments, {{we found}} a peak in the final mass loss for the {{substrate}} with 15 g of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and 35 g of cake syrup (Fig.  1 b). Hereafter, the proportion of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and syrup is shown (e.g., 15 – 35 substrate). Figure  1 a shows the mass change of the system during experiments. The mass rapidly decreased in the first 100  s for 5 – 45, 10 – 40, 15 – 35, 20 – 30, and 25 – 25 substrates. We observed small mass loss (0.31 g) for the 0 – 50 substrate. We regarded this mass change as being due to the generation and release of water vapor by an interaction of poured heated syrup and {{the water in the}} cake syrup. Assuming this, we obtained an efficiency of 0.31 / 50 = 0.0062 g per gram of poured syrup. Considering this effect, we calculated mass loss caused by <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> decomposition (i.e., generation and release of CO_ 2). In our experimental setting, the maximum mass loss was observed for the 15 – 35 substrate (0.83 g, Additional file 1 : Table S 1). This nonlinear peak seems enigmatic because of the occurrence of increasing amount of the source material in more soda-rich substrates. For the 15 – 35 substrate, rapid mass loss was initially observed (Fig.  1 a). The decomposed <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> ratio (decomposed <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> mass calculated from generated CO_ 2 /input <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> mass) is high at low <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> content and low at high <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> content (Fig.  1 c).|$|R

40|$|Background: Bread is {{the staple}} food of Iranian society. Attention to its health and hygiene is important. Nowadays, {{the use of}} <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> in the {{production}} of bread has seen by most of bakers which is because of producing bread with more beautiful and appearance and is more public acceptance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study that 40 people were taken, consumer satisfaction of prepared Barbari bread using three types additives Fenugreek juice, <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> and tomato juice by means of questionnaires were evaluated. Results: The results of this study showed that consumer satisfaction of taste and smell (34 of 40), appearance, glazing, and quality (36 of 40) of prepared bread by tomato juice was more than Fenugreek juice and <b>baking</b> <b>soda.</b> Consumer satisfaction of taste, smell, appearance, glazing, quality, shopping satisfaction, and quality of bread over time of three types of additives (<b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> tomato juice, and Fenugreek juice) was significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Tomato juice has the attributes necessary for public acceptance and satisfaction of consumers, nevertheless don’t have the complications of <b>baking</b> <b>soda.</b> So it can be a reasonable alternative for the processing of bread dough instead of <b>baking</b> <b>soda...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} above, {{baking powder}} is mainly just <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> mixed with an acid. In principle, {{a number of}} kitchen acids may be combined with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> to simulate commercial baking powders. Vinegar (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common acidifier in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar. Where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt, <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted {{for some of the}} liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the <b>baking</b> <b>soda.</b> The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.|$|R
50|$|Honeycomb toffee, sponge toffee or cinder toffee is a sugary toffee with a light, rigid, sponge-like texture.

The <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> and acid {{react to form}} carbon dioxide which is trapped in the highly viscous mixture. When acid is not used, thermal decomposition of the <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> releases carbon dioxide. The lattice structure is formed while the sugar is liquid, then the toffee sets hard.|$|R

To understand the clear picture about saliva secretion, the volume, flow rate, pH and viscosity were then measured. The aim {{of this research was}} to obtain a picture about the difference of saliva secretion before and after rinsing with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> on menopause women. The type of the research used was a laboratory quasi-experiment with comparative descriptive form. The technique used in this research is the survey method, and samples were taken using the multistage cluster random sampling method, and t-student statistical analysis. This research was conducted with the saliva collected with spitting method on 45 menopause women. The results show that the average volume, flow rate, pH and viscosity before rinsing with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> was 1. 79 ml, 0. 18 ml/minute, 7. 40 and 0. 81 mm 2 /second. The average volume, flow rate, pH and viscosity after rinsing with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> were 2. 66 ml; 0. 27 ml/minute; 8. 67 and 0. 78 mm 2 /second. Statistical analysis t-student on α = 0. 05 shows volume changes, flow rate, pH and saliva viscosity before and after rinsing with <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> was 0. 873; 0. 086; 1. 273 and 0. 037 respectively.

40|$|Background and purpose:Consumption of <b>baking</b> <b>soda,</b> as {{a primary}} {{material}} for preparation of bread dough, has been banned due to its health complications in Iran. So bread production in our country faced difficulties and one part of them is related to health issues which are bread production. Also, in some cases, <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> {{is used in the}} bread production. This study was done to study the environmental health status and consumption of <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> in the military and urban Lavash bakeries of Tehran in 2012. Materials and methods:This is a descriptive comparative study done on Lavash bread production of 14 military bakeries and 14 corresponding urban bakeries near them. PH in the samples was tested based on Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran No. 2628. To check the status of environmental health and personal hygiene of bakeries, the check list of Cereal Research Center was used. Results:In terms of environmental health status, 28. 6 % military bakeries and 7. 1 % urban bakeries were at good level. In terms of personal hygiene, all bakeries were in the poor category. Also, 42. 9 % of military Lavash bakeries and 14. 3 % of urban Lavash bakeries used <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> in their bread production. Conclusion:Environment health and personal hygiene status in military bakeries are better than the urban bakeries however, hygiene status was not desirable in military bakeries. Also, <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> consumption in military bakeries was more common than the urban bakeries. According to the results of this study, control of health status and avoiding <b>baking</b> <b>soda</b> consumption in the bakeries are necessary...|$|R
