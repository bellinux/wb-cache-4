5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned his}} idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections including the fact that Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> German audiences might confuse the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial {{to the defense of}} St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, after the fall of France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres {{in the world that}} are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E

40|$|Title Concerns of {{terminally ill}} patients; a {{qualitative}} study at <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> {{terminally ill patients}} experience. Background Terminally ill patients can experience many concerns. These <b>concerns</b> can affect <b>the</b> choices these patients make in their life and illnesses and it can affect {{the overall quality of}} life. Therefore it is necessary to gain insight in these concerns. Aim and research questions The propose of this research was to gain insight in <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> terminally ill patients experience. This description can possibly provide a lead for caretakers, so they can anticipate and open the discussion on these concerns with patients and other caretakers. The research question was: Which concerns experience terminally ill patients and how do patients deal with these concerns? Method A qualitative descriptive design was used. To collect data 11 semi structured interviews were held. The study population were terminally ill hospice patients. Data was analyzed by using open, selective and axial coding. Results <b>The</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> respondents experienced were described in theme`s: don`t want to be a burden on others, physical limitations of the illness, dying itself, legacy for family and friends and the world, staying in control over their own life, significance of death for themselves and others. The way patients cope with their <b>concerns</b> is divers. <b>The</b> respondents seem to search for a way of coping that fits their own concerns and situation best. Conclusion It seems <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> terminally ill patients experience are very divers. And many different factors seem to have influence on these concerns. How patients cope with their concerns is individually determined. Recommendations It is recommended to set up a larger qualitative study at <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> of terminally ill patients. With this study patients and their concerns can be researched during their disease...|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{there was a}} serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews.

Some {{of the reasons for}} the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> it might become a messianic sect.
