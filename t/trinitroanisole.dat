50|$|Beginning in 1942 an {{improved}} {{version of the}} bomb was built. Its nose was much less thick and it contained 35.7 kg of <b>trinitroanisole.</b> It weighed 811.2 kg.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, <b>trinitroanisole</b> {{was used}} as a {{military}} explosive (e.g., Japanese [...] ), however, due to its tendency to form picric acid and dangerous picrate salts, its use has largely been abandoned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trinitroanisole</b> is a {{chemical}} compound that exists as pale yellow crystals with a melting point of 68 °C. It is an explosive with a detonation velocity of 7200 meters per second.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trinitroanisole</b> can be {{prepared}} by the reaction of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene with methanol {{in the presence of}} sodium hydroxide followed by the nitration of the resulting product. Alternatively, it can {{be prepared}} directly by the reaction of picryl chloride with methanol in the presence of sodium hydroxide.|$|E

50|$|The early {{development}} {{of this type of}} complex takes place {{around the turn of the}} 19th century. In 1886 Janovski observed an intense violet color when he mixed meta-dinitrobenzene with an alcoholic solution of alkali. In 1895 Lobry de Bruyn investigated a red substance formed in the reaction of trinitrobenzene with potassium hydroxide in methanol. In 1900 Jackson and Gazzolo reacted <b>trinitroanisole</b> with sodium methoxide and proposed a quinoid structure for the reaction product.|$|E
