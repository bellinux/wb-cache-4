Pyrodinium is a monospecific species with two varieties, Pyrodinium bahamense var. compressum and Pyrodinium bahamanse var. bahamense. Although it was widely believed that the compressum variety is toxic and found in the Pacific while the bahamense variety is nontoxic and found in the Atlantic, a 1972 <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom</b> of Pyrodinium bahamense in Papua New Guinea [...] showed that P. bahamense could also be toxic. It is known now that P. bahamense is {{a major cause of}} seafood toxicity and cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning, especially in Southeast Asia. The species is also the cause of toxicity in Central American coasts. It has also been discovered that {{there are at least two}} places in the world where both varieties of Pyrodium bahamense are found together, the Persian Gulf and coast of Mexico. An association between Pyrodinium bahamense occurrence and mangrove forests has been suggested, although, the presence of mangrove forest is not necessarily a predictor for presence of P. bahamense var. bahamense, as it is absent in western and southern Florida Bay.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{natural and}} {{aquaculture}} fish deaths in Kuwait Bay occurred from September to October of 1999 and {{were attributed to}} a bloom of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium sp. A chronology of the bloom event suggests that a period of low winds and stable water-column structure preceded the bloom. Maximum cell concentrations of Gymnodinium sp. (3 ̆e 6 x 10 (6) cells l(- 1)) were also immediately preceded by a more than 20 -fold increase in mean inorganic nitrogen concentrations (up to 60 muM) and elevated inorganic phosphate concentrations. This, combined with elevated inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations within the bloom, suggests that coastal nutrient eutrophication was Likely to have contributed significantly to bloom development and support. Termination of the Gymnodinium sp. bloom coincided with a bloom of the non-toxic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, which appeared as large red patches in Kuwait Bay.

Using this new methodology, 51 sponges were screened. Further investigations {{were carried out}} on seven of the 51 organisms, resulting in the isolation of several known and eight novel compounds. Clathriols A (32) and B (33) are novel sterols isolated from the sponge Clathria lissosclera. Both 32 and 33 possess the rare 14 Beta stereochemistry, a feature only naturally occurring in marine sponges. Both are also moderate anti-inflammatory compounds. Ten spongian diterpenes were isolated from the New Zealand, sponge Chelonaplysilla violacea, six of which are novel. Cadlinolides C (138) and D (139) are similar to several previously reported compounds while pourewic acid A (140), 15 -methoxypourewic acid B (141), methylpourewate B (142) and pourewanone (143) have unique structural features and are of biogenetic significance.

Domoic acid has been intermittently observed {{in the water column}} when Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are not present, and presence or absence of cells is generally a poor indicator of toxin concentration in the water and sentinel mussel samples. Chlorophyll a and domoic acid values from seawater, sediment and Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) samples from February through December 2013 were analyzed and compared to a long-running weekly time series at the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, part of the California Department of Public Health monitoring program, to investigate retention of domoic acid in the sediments. We hypothesized that domoic acid concentrations in the sediment would increase immediately following a Pseudo-nitzschia bloom and increased domoic acid concentrations in the water column would follow a mixing event due to sediment and bottom water resuspension. Despite the lack of a significant <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom</b> during the study period, domoic acid was consistently observed at the sediment-water interface. Peaks of domoic acid concentrations in SPATT samples preceded peaks of particulate domoic acid from seawater samples, suggesting that the domoic acid source was more closely associated with the sediment-water interface. Sediment resuspension is a likely origin, suggesting that the sediment is potentially acting as a reservoir for domoic acid. It may be important for public health monitoring programs to include a sediment toxin analysis, particularly given the known presence of domoic acid in commercially harvested benthic organisms, such as crabs and flatfish...|$|E

40|$|The main {{shipping}} {{activity in}} Bantry Bay is centred at Leahill, a site {{where there is}} aggregate extraction with direct transmission to bulk carriers at a dedicated pier. The size of vessels ranges from 250 to 7, 800 mtNRT but {{with the majority of}} vessels being of 700 to l, 800 mtNRT. Ballast water from these vessels is required to be deposited at sea before entering the Bay should these vessels becoming from outside of Ireland. If this is done the risk of introducing dinoflagellate species present in those ports in Atlantic France and Spain will be reduced. Vessels from Irish ports are not required to discharge ballast before entering the Bay. The main risk to Bantry Bay, albeit small - because the amount of ballast discharged is small, is from inoculations of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense from ships that have ballasted in Cork Harbouror Belfast Lough. It would be prudent for vessels ballasting in these sea inlets not {{to do so in the}} region and during the time of the <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom</b> events.

The development of a management plan for ships' ballasting in Cork Harbour and Belfast Lough based on cyst distributions and the distribution of algal bloom events could greatly reduce the risk of a transfer. In the meantime discoloured water in Cork Harbour and Belfast Lough should not be ballasted.

The full text of the complete book is freely available at: [URL] hypothetical case study {{has been made of}} a 100 MW OTEC plant, which would require around 400 m 3 /sec of warm water feed (with 200 m 3 /sec of cold water feed) and resulted in the following data: CO 2 saving compared to coal power plant, as determined from lifecycle assessment (LCA) studies, would be 98. 62 % for CC-OTEC, 97. 41 % for the hybrid type, and 94. 4 % for OC-OTEC. Energy payback period value would be 1. 33 years. Cost of power generation from NPV concept of such plant is estimated to be of 2. 9 p/kWh. 172, 800 m 3 of potable water/day could be available from OC-OTEC (but none from CC-OTEC though a hybrid type may yield appreciable potable water). More than 68, 000 kg shellfish/day could be availed for all types of 100 MW OTEC. Upwelling of the nutrient rich cold water along with abundant plankton from sea-bottom and the mixed discharge of it in the ocean during OTEC operations is likely to help growth of the oceans’ flora and fauna for the abundant supply of seafood. But the danger posed from simultaneous upwelling of <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom</b> endangering the marine species, are also apprehended. However, by and large positive marine species growth has been opined. Such increased species growth becomes instrumental in burying CO 2 in the deep ocean floor with the carcasses of dead marine species grown. This phenomenon known as sequestering of CO 2, appreciably increases the ocean’s CO 2 storage capability and thereby in addressing the problem of global warming. This is in addition to the amount of CO 2 saved from use of alternate energy source on OTEC, against the conventional fossil fuel resources. Upwelling of cold water may be utilized in cold storages/air conditioning saving 600 times the power required for running the same. Hydrogen production, as may be made at expense of the net power generated, from a 100 MW plant, would amount to over 35, 000 kg/day or 20, 000 kg of NH 3 /day. 21, 773 kg of CO 2 /day from OC-OTEC (also from the hybrid type but not for CC-OTEC) would be available, which can be utilized as raw material for soda ash manufacture/urea production (along with NH 3 as may be availed from H 2 production). Also a huge quantity of oxygen enriched air – near 33 % O 2 content, against 20. 93 % of normal air may be availed. 188, 812 kg/day of methanol utilizing the H 2, as may be generated can thereby be the resource raw material for petrochemical industries, opening up the scope of availability of a chemical hub {{in the vicinity of the}} OTEC plant. Such OTEC plants can help sustainable development, particularly small island developing states (SIDS), arresting coral bleaching (decreasing acid rains etc.), and generating employment; and also help in reducing global warming from sequestering of CO 2, in addition to saving CO 2 emission compared to conventional fossil fuel power generators...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there are}} no {{authenticated}} records of human illness due to PSP in New Zealand, nationwide phytoplankton and shellfish toxicity monitoring programmes have revealed {{that the incidence of}} PSP contamination and the occurrence of the toxic Alexandrium species are more common than previously realised (Mackenzie et al., 2004). A full understanding of the mechanism of uptake, accumulation and toxin dynamics of bivalves feeding on toxic algae is fundamental for improving future regulations in the shellfish toxicity monitoring program across the country. This thesis examines the effects of toxic dinoflagellates and PSP toxins on the physiology and behaviour of bivalve molluscs. This focus arose because these aspects have not been widely studied before in New Zealand. The basic hypothesis tested was that bivalve molluscs differ in their ability to metabolise PSP toxins produced by Alexandrium tamarense and are able to transform toxins and may have special mechanisms to avoid toxin uptake. To test this hypothesis, different physiological/behavioural experiments and quantification of PSP toxins in bivalves tissues were carried out on mussels (Perna canaliculus), clams (Paphies donacina and Dosinia anus), scallops (Pecten novaezelandiae) and oysters (Ostrea chilensis) from the South Island of New Zealand. Measurements of clearance rate were used to test the sensitivity of the bivalves to PSP toxins. Other studies that involved intoxication and detoxification periods were carried out on three species of bivalves (P. canaliculus, P. donacina, P. novaezelandiae), using physiological responses (clearance and excretion rate) and analysis of PSP toxins in the tissues over these periods. Complementary experiments that investigated other responses in bivalves fed with the toxic cells were also carried out. These included byssus production, and the presence of toxic cells in the faeces of mussels, the siphon activity and burrowing depth in clams and the oxygen consumption in scallops. The most resistant species to PSP toxins were the mussel, Perna canaliculus and the clam, Dosinia anus. Both species fed actively on toxic dinoflagellates and accumulated toxins. The intoxication and detoxication rate of the mussel was faster than the other species of bivalve studied (P. donacina and P. novaezelandiae) which confirm mussels as a good sentinel species for early warning of toxic algal blooms. The clearance rate of the clam, Paphies donacina decreased when fed on Alexandrium species but the effect of the PSP toxins on this physiological response was not confirmed. Over the detoxification period of 8 days, this clam did not detoxify which suggests that its ability to retain high level of toxins for an extensive period may be critical for public health management. The scallop, Pecten novaezelandiae was clearly the most sensitive species to the PSP toxins and the clearance rate was significantly lower {{in the presence of the}} toxic dinoflagellate A. tamarense. Although the clearance rate was low, the scallops still fed on the toxic dinoflagellate and accumulated PSP toxins in the tissues. The scallops detoxified slowly which would affect the market for this bivalve in the presence of a <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom.</b> This bivalve would retain PSP toxins for longer period of time than other species such as mussels. The oyster, Ostrea chilensis, had erratic clearance rate and did not respond clearly to any of the variables tested over the time. Oysters accumulated more toxins than the sensitive species, but they had been exposed to two more days of feeding with A. tamarense; therefore this species may actually have a similar intoxication responses to P. novaezalandiae and P. donacina. The results from this thesis suggest further directions for the aquaculture sector and ongoing research in this field, which in future will lead to a better selection of suitable species for culture as well as species for monitoring of PSP toxins. In the future, research that integrates field and controlled laboratory studies will expand to other species of interest and a more complete record will in time be available in order to manage more efficiently the negative effects that harmful algal blooms may have in New Zealand...|$|E

Phytoplankton enumeration and identification in conjunction with phycotoxin monitoring is an efficient strategy for identifying known toxic events and predicting new ones. In order to investigate methods for the early detection of <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms,</b> a threeyear project was implemented in Ship Harbour, Nova Scotia, which is an important site for mussel aquaculture. The water column was routinely monitored in situ from spring to fall, (2004 - 2006) for phycotoxins using solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) bags and for phytoplankton composition. Over the three-year period, annual patterns in species succession were observed. Several potentially toxic species were found to occur including Alexandrium tamarense and Alexandrium ostenfeldii. These species were most abundant from late May-July. Gonyaulax spinifera (prox) was observed in early fall (Sept-Oct) for the past two years. Pseudonitzchia seriata peaked in July each year. Several species of Dinophysis were most abundant in June and August but occurred in lower numbers throughout the entire season. Phycotoxins can accumulate in shellfish tissue and cause toxic incidents if not detected prior to shellfish harvesting. Toxins were quantified and correlated with cell concentrations of toxin-producing species. Temporal observations of species succession and population structure displayed reoccurring patterns throughout the three-year project. Concurrent measurements of toxin concentration and population dynamics provide an accurate assessment of <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> events.

40|$|Ecological {{problems}} are typically multi faceted {{and need to}} be addressed from a scientific and a management perspective. There is a wealth of modelling and simulation software available, each designed to address a particular aspect of the issue of concern. Choosing the appropriate tool, making sense of the disparate outputs, and taking decisions when little or no empirical data is available, are everyday challenges facing the ecologist and environmental manager. Bayesian Networks provide a statistical modelling framework that enables analysis and integration of information in its own right as well as integration of a variety of models addressing different aspects of a common overall problem. There has been increased interest in the use of BNs to model environmental systems and issues of concern. However, the development of more sophisticated BNs, utilising dynamic and object oriented (OO) features, is still at the frontier of ecological research. Such features are particularly appealing in an ecological context, since the underlying facts are often spatial and temporal in nature. This thesis focuses on an integrated BN approach which facilitates OO modelling. Our research devises a new heuristic method, the Iterative Bayesian Network Development Cycle (IBNDC), for the development of BN models within a multi-field and multi-expert context. Expert elicitation is a popular method used to quantify BNs when data is sparse, but expert knowledge is abundant. The resulting BNs need to be substantiated and validated taking this uncertainty into account. Our research demonstrates the application of the IBNDC approach to support these aspects of BN modelling. The complex nature of environmental issues makes them ideal case studies for the proposed integrated approach to modelling. Moreover, they lend themselves to a series of integrated sub-networks describing different scientific components, combining scientific and management perspectives, or pooling similar contributions developed in different locations by different research groups. In southern Africa the two largest free-ranging cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) populations are in Namibia and Botswana, where the majority of cheetahs are located outside protected areas. Consequently, cheetah conservation in these two countries is focussed primarily on the free-ranging populations as well as the mitigation of conflict between humans and cheetahs. In contrast, in neighbouring South Africa, the majority of cheetahs are found in fenced reserves. Nonetheless, conflict between humans and cheetahs remains an issue here. Conservation effort in South Africa is also focussed on managing the geographically isolated cheetah populations as one large meta-population. Relocation is one option among a suite of tools used to resolve human-cheetah conflict in southern Africa. Successfully relocating captured problem cheetahs, and maintaining a viable free-ranging cheetah population, are two environmental issues in cheetah conservation forming the first case study in this thesis. The second case study involves the initiation of blooms of Lyngbya majuscula, a blue-green algae, in Deception Bay, Australia. L. majuscula is a <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>bloom</b> which has severe health, ecological and economic impacts on the community located in the vicinity of this algal bloom.

This group of algae includes other widespread blooms such as red tides. The occurrence of Lyngbya blooms is not a local phenomenon, but blooms of this toxic weed occur in coastal waters worldwide. With the increase in frequency and extent of these HAB blooms, it is important {{to gain a better understanding}} of the underlying factors contributing to the initiation and sustenance of these blooms.

We present dry season soluble Fe data from the Savannah Fires in the Early Dry Season (SAFIRED) campaign in northern Australia that reflects coincident dust and biomass burning sources of soluble aerosol Fe. The mean soluble and total aerosol Fe concentrations were 40 and 500  ng m − 3 respectively.

We observed fractional Fe solubility up to 12  % in mixed aerosols. Thus, Fe in dust may be more soluble in the tropics compared to higher latitudes due to higher concentrations of biomass-burning-derived reactive organic species in the atmosphere. In addition, biomass-burning-derived particles can act as a surface for aerosol Fe to bind during atmospheric transport and subsequently be released to the ocean upon deposition. As the aerosol loading is dominated by biomass burning emissions over the tropical waters in the dry season, additions of biomass-burning-derived soluble Fe could have harmful consequences for initiating nitrogen-fixing <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms.</b> Future research is required to quantify biomass-burning-derived particle sources of soluble Fe over tropical waters...|$|R

Thus, the release of untreated sewage into the sea does not constitute an adequate environmental practice; then, urban effluents should be treated in order to remove nutrients, contaminants and pathogenic organisms and avoid environmental degradation...|$|R
40|$|Eutrophication of waters {{can lead}} to the {{development}} of blooms of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and consequent health and environmental problems. The presence of these organisms in recreational and drinking waters is generally undesirable or even hazardous, although nitrogen fixing blue-green algae can be beneficially used as biofertilisers for plantation crops. This paper reviews the characteristics of cyanobacteria and particularly their toxins. The mechanisms of <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms</b> are discussed, as are the factors influencing toxin production. The nuisance and health hazards associated with freshwater bluegreen algae are discussed and the options for public health control are evaluated. The problems associated with statutory control of toxic algae problems is also considered...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a virtual special issue that reviews the development of analytical approaches to the determination of phosphorus species in natural waters. The focus is on sampling and sample treatment, analytical methods and quality assurance of the data. The export of phosphorus from anthropogenic activities (from diffuse and point sources) can result in increased primary production and eutrophication, and potentially the seasonal development of <b>toxic</b> <b>algal</b> <b>blooms,</b> which can significantly impact on water quality. Therefore the quantification of phosphorus species in natural waters provides important baseline data for studying aquatic phosphorus biogeochemistry, assessing ecosystem health and monitoring compliance with legislation...|$|R
