5|$|Since 2002, the American National Archives stores {{important}} national documents {{such as the}} Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled {{cases to}} inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.|$|E

5|$|The {{media of}} these devices were {{crystals}} with transition metal ion impurities, absorbing low-energy light and re-emitting it in the visible range. By the 1970s, atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation, as they {{were found to be}} superior to the metallic salts and crystals <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's religious practices. One was to have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E
5|$|Ion Ghica was a {{valuable}} ally for Yiddish theater in Bucharest. On several occasions he expressed his favorable {{view of the}} quality of acting, and even more of the technical aspects of the Yiddish theater.

The result was that all but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers.|$|E

5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided to anybody who died of fright while watching the film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} in Regina struggled to deliver {{services to the}} vast territory. The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike, as well as constant fighting {{with the federal government}} over limited legislative powers and minimal revenue collection, hampered the effectiveness of government. The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members. In 1897, after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant-Governors, a short-lived period of party politics evolved that challenged the consensus model of government <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} the mansion at Wappocomo was built in 1774 by Nicholas Casey (1745–1833), using bricks <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The Wappocomo property had {{been a part of}} the South Branch Survey of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron's Northern Neck Proprietary.

5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> by his aunt, Queen Mary, {{who died in}} 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, {{he was suffering from}} a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E
