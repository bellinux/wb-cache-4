5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
5|$|He {{had little}} impact on <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navy, but he was {{interested}} enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of John Flamsteed's Observations in 1704.

Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E

It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided {{to focus more on}} his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom. Although women could not lead military forces, in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked on the land as part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E
5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials. He complained of Diệm's reliance on Nhu in <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, Nhu's attempt {{to run a}} police state through his secret Cần Lao apparatus {{and the lack of}} success against the Việt Cộng. During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was heading in the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E

Hvidøre and some of Marie's {{jewellery}} were sold. With Olga's inheritance, Kulikovsky {{and his family were}} able to purchase Knudsminde Farm, several miles outside of Copenhagen. Kulikovsky was appointed to the board of a Russian insurance company based in Copenhagen, and oversaw <b>the</b> <b>running</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farm.

Adonijah served at the military hospital in Clinton, Missouri, where he met and married Sarah Ellen Westfall, the eldest daughter of a wealthy farming family from Vernon County, Missouri, who became Marquis' mother.

They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 {{minutes for the}} race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E
