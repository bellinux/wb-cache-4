The Nickelodeon was equally positive and began to reflect the acting, staging and photography {{was up to the}} regular standard of the Thanhouser company. The New York Dramatic Mirror offered additional comments on the Thanhouser company's higher standards in their productions, but gave an otherwise positive review that focused on <b>the</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> the circus scenes.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and <b>the</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with <b>the</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} design {{processes}} in small established companies and investigates how these design processes are executed. How two different kinds <b>of</b> <b>novelty</b> influence <b>the</b> design processes is further examined: <b>the</b> relative <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product being developed and <b>the</b> relative <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> design processes. <b>The</b> relative <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product is high {{if it is}} a radically new product to develop. High relative novelty for design processes typically means no experience or knowledge about design processes. Based on an embedded multiple case study of three small established companies in Sweden, eight different design processes are described and analyzed. The results show that the design processes differ, even within the same company. The results also show that relative <b>novelty</b> affects <b>the</b> design process. If <b>the</b> relative <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> product to be developed and of design processes is low, a linear, structured, and systematic design process was found to work. A design process that is cyclical, experimental, and knowledge-creating seems to work no matter <b>the</b> relative <b>novelty...</b>|$|R

These patrons were intrigued by <b>the</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> a female writer and had her compose texts about their romantic exploits. Her output during this period was prolific.

25|$|Studies using PET {{have come}} to the same {{conclusions}} regarding the use of the parahippocampal gyrus for prospective memory. The parahippocampal gyrus is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be able to remember one half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal gyrus is additionally involved in monitoring <b>the</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> presented stimuli.

25|$|Marshall and his {{co-workers}} used their asymmetric allenylmetal-homoaldol tactic to construct polypropionate frameworks of (+)-discodermolide. <b>The</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> the Marshall approach is that the three stereotriad subunits are assembled through addition of non-racemic allenylmetal reagents to (S)-3-silyloxy-2-methylpropanal to generate both syn/syn and syn/anti adducts. The central feature for the synthesis of the alkyl iodide fragment was the treatment of aldehyde to allenyltributylstannane {{in the presence of}} BF3-etherate to get the syn/syn isomer. Syn/anti methyl-hydroxyl-methyl stereotriads were obtained through the reaction between aldehyde and homochiral allenylzinc reagent.|$|E
