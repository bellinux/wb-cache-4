5|$|Bill Belichick {{achieved}} his 200th career {{head coaching}} win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49–19; {{it was his}} 163rd such win as Patriots coach. The Patriots defeated the Jets in Week seven of the 2015 season by a score of 30–23, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 6–0 record to date.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats as best he could for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> higher clearance from the water.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expansion}} Atlanta Dream set {{a record}} for the longest losing streak in WNBA history with 17 losses <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> 0-17 start <b>to</b> the season.|$|R
60|$|The Bassa and {{his companions}} were struck both with {{the beauty of the}} Jewess and also with her words, and begged her <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> explanation.|$|R

5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E
5|$|Damon hit a {{home run}} to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2-1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth {{straight}} game; it proved to be the game-winning run. Ramírez singled in the third inning to give him a hit in 17consecutive postseason games. Doubles by David Ortiz to right and Trot Nixon to center, who narrowly missed a grand slam after swinging on a 3-0 count, scored two more runs for the Red Sox <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> three-run lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't expect {{girls to}} be on hand always," [...] said Andy gaily. [...] "You've got <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> <b>a</b> chance <b>to</b> get the hair-buns over their ears." ...|$|R

5|$|Heskey {{suffered}} a suspected broken metatarsal in September 2007, {{and made his}} return for Wigan in a 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in November. He picked up an ankle injury during Wigan's 5–3 victory against Blackburn in December 2007. On 14 April 2008, Heskey scored a 90th minute equalising goal against Chelsea, which damaged their hopes of winning the Premier League. He went on to score Wigan's equaliser against Tottenham in the following match <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 1–1 draw, which proved to be his last goal of 2007–08, which he finished with 4 goals in 30 appearances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Auburn scored first again when Dorsey {{recovered}} an Alabama fumble {{and returned it}} 65-yards for a touchdown. After a successful extra point the blue and orange extended their lead to 20–12. Alabama responded on their following possession with a 30-yard William Little touchdown run and Kyser extra point to cut the lead to 20–18. Thomas Daniels then scored Auburn's final two touchdowns on runs of one and 25 yards and also converted both extra points <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 32–18 lead. Smith scored the final points of the game late {{in the second half}} for Alabama on a short run that made the final score 32–22.|$|E
5|$|In {{their meeting}} against the North Texas Mean Green, Alabama outgained their {{opponent}} 586 to 169 yards of total offense in Alabama's 41–0 victory. After a 26-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal gave the Crimson Tide a 3–0 lead, Trent Richardson scored their first touchdown {{of the evening}} on Alabama's second offensive possession <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 10–0 lead {{at the end of}} the first period. The Crimson Tide extended their lead to 20–0 by halftime after a 43-yard Eddie Lacy touchdown run and a 37-yard Shelley field goal in the second quarter.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, CBS's 60 Minutes {{attributed}} the recent trend of American parents [...] "redshirting" [...] their five-year-olds (postponing entrance) <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> advantage in kindergarten to a section in Gladwell's Outliers.|$|R

50|$|Swinton put {{the first}} {{points on the}} board with a try on 4 minutes from Richie Hawkyard. Former Vikings man Gavin Dodd added the extras for Swinton <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> early 6-0 lead.|$|R
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{score for}} the Bourne Identity was {{composed}} by John Powell. Powell was bought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded a more traditional orchestral {{score for the}} film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since {{a lot of the}} music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell's score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 'cinematic' quality.|$|E

50|$|Since 1998 the Republicans held a {{majority}} in the House of Representatives which, since the 2004 elections, had been reduced to a slim 68-66. In 2006 the DFL gained 19 seats <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> 85-49 majority.|$|R
5|$|After {{playing in}} sevens tournaments in Fiji and Canberra, Serevi {{returned}} to the Hong Kong Sevens. After defeating South Africa in their quarter-final, Fiji lost to eventual winners New Zealand in their semi-final. In 1995, Serevi captained Fiji to the Hong Kong Sevens final. He scored three tries in their semi-final victory over Australia. They then faced New Zealand in the final, and although leading 17–14 at one point, eventually lost the game 35–17. In the 1996 tournament, Fiji again met New Zealand in the final; New Zealand led after Serevi tripped Christian Cullen close to Fiji's try line. This {{was followed by a}} break from Serevi to give Setareki Naivaluwaqa a try. New Zealand scored twice more however, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 19–17 victory. Serevi finished the year by leading Fiji to victory in the Dubai Sevens.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{came to the}} Giro {{without a}} real overall {{classification}} hopeful. Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> chance at a stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, {{which resulted in the}} team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. Again just as in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{two teams}} matched up in four ball {{competition}} on day two. The international team won three matches to one, with two others being halved, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> 8 <b>to</b> 4 lead going into Sunday's singles.|$|R

5|$|During {{cleaning}} {{day at the}} Simpsons' house, Bart wins a KBBL radio contest {{after the}} station's DJs, Bill and Marty, call him up. They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs. They decide on the former option.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} {{enough from}} {{the events of the}} previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only one there. She ventures upstairs to investigate; after failing to find anything, she accidentally fires her weapon, narrowly missing Peter. They bring Hughes in for questioning, and he refuses <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> blood sample for their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Giants {{made the}} playoffs for the third {{consecutive}} season. In a September game against the Eagles, they tied the NFL record for most sacks in a game by sacking Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb 12 times, with Osi Umenyiora recording six of those sacks. They became the third NFL franchise to win 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31–10 in October. That same month, they also played in the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America, in London's Wembley Stadium, where they beat Miami 13–10. They ended the regular season 10–6 and defeated Tampa Bay 24–14 {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, earning Manning and Coughlin their first playoff victories with the Giants. The next week, the Giants won their ninth consecutive road game by beating the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys 21–17. In the NFC championship game, Lawrence Tynes kicked an overtime field goal <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> 23–20 road victory over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
