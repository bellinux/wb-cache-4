40|$|This study {{analyzes}} consumer purchasing {{behavior of}} organic {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables using the 2006 Nielsen Homescan panel. An ordered logit model was estimated to quantify the impacts of economic and socio-demographic factors on the probability of a household belonging to a specific organic user group—devoted, casual, or nonuser. Results suggest that price and income, to some extent, affect consumer purchases of organic produce. Addi-tionally, the profile of an organic produce user is most likely to consist of an Hispanic household residing in the Western United States with children under 6 years old and a household head older than 54 years with at least a college degree. Key Words: Nielsen Homescan data, ordered logit, organic fruits and vegetables, user groups JEL Classifications: C 25, D 12, M 31, Q 11 The market for organic foods has grown rapidly in the past decade as they have become in-creasingly affordable and available in main-stream grocery stores. Awidely held belief in the organic <b>trade</b> <b>circle</b> is that price and income do not necessarily track organic sales (Fromartz, 2006; Hartman Group, 2006). Lack of influence exerted by price and income on organic pur-chases appears to contradict each other. In the early development of the organic food market, organic sales concentrated in niche markets, such as natural and specialty food stores, which serve affluent consumers. Affluent consumers may place a high value on the health and envi-ronmental benefits of organic food and hence may be willing to pay the premium—price does not matter but income does. As organic foods seep into mainstream supermarkets, they be-come available to a much larger consumer base of less affluent, price conscious customers. As a result of the phenomenal growth in the organic sector during the past decade, the roles of price and income in organic sales may have evolved. A traditional and popular perception suggests that most organic consumers are white, female, young, wealthy, and well-educated (Buzby an...|$|E
