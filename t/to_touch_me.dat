2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his {{flamboyant}} clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the [...] "King of King's Road". Clark pronounced himself a [...] "master cutter. It's {{all in my}} brain and fingers and there's no-one in the world <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me.</b> I can do everything myself." [...] Clark's great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s {{thanks in large part}} to the popularity of Clark's clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and moss crepe fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 1985, while {{performing}} her nude act at the [...] "Cine-Stage" [...] within the Mitchell Brothers' O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, Chambers {{was arrested by}} a vice squad and charged with committing a lewd act {{in a public place}} and soliciting prostitution. It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called [...] "Feel the Magic". She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped. [...] "I've never been arrested in my life for anything, ever, so {{this is kind of a}} big shock for me, not only as a performer but as a human being", Chambers said at the time. [...] "It's a heartbreaker. This is supposed to be a hip city. I really love -- make that LOVED -- this city. These people have been my fans for years, and it's a thrill for them <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> up close. There's nothing illegal if I'm not taking money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get out, sir," [...] says he, as fierce as posbil; and I felt somethink (I {{think it}} was the tip of his <b>to)</b> <b>touching</b> <b>me</b> behind, and found myself, nex minit, {{sprawling}} among the wet flannings and buckets and things.|$|R
6000|$|Amicia. Fortunately: {{think what}} some of them might be! Though Florentia saw nothing I saw many things in this poor little shabby [...] "Due d'Enghien," [...] coming over to our roaring London, where the dots {{have to be so}} big on the i's, with its barely audible note of originality. It appealed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>touched</b> <b>me,</b> offered me a poignant {{suggestion}} of the way things happen in life.|$|R
60|$|This ought <b>to</b> have <b>touched</b> <b>me,</b> and in {{a manner}} it did, but the wrong manner. I felt I was {{behaving}} badly; and was now not only angry with Alan, but angry with myself in the bargain; {{and it made me}} the more cruel.|$|R
60|$|STREPHON. Oh, I don't know. But don't {{you want}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me?</b> You used to.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think naught," [...] said Myles gruffly. [...] "He {{will not}} dare <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> to harm me. I fear him not." [...] Nevertheless, {{he did not}} speak the full {{feelings}} of his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll do jest as you say, aunt Dorcas; but I've {{been hurt}} worse'n {{this a good}} many times, an' never had any one <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> up the same's you seem bound on doin'." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "He came {{up under}} my privates {{and then he}} grabbed my {{testicles}} twice," [...] J.E. said in an interview. [...] "I wanted {{to turn around and}} tell him <b>to</b> stop <b>touching</b> <b>me.</b> I wanted it to be over and I just wanted to call my dad because I knew something wasn't right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep on {{your hands}} and knees," [...] Hector whispered, [...] "and feel the ground as you go {{to make sure that there}} are no broken {{branches}} that would crack if you placed your knee upon them. We may come upon the Spaniards at any moment. Keep close <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Touch</b> <b>me</b> if you hear the slightest sound, and I will do the same <b>to</b> you. The <b>touch</b> will mean stop. Move your sword along the belt till the handle is round at your back; in that way there will be no risk of it striking a tree or catching in a projecting root." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care!" [...] Pony sobbed out. [...] "She won't have {{a chance}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> again!" [...] For he had {{made up his mind}} to run off with the circus which was coming the next Tuesday.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall remain!" [...] I answered. [...] "I {{am here to}} see Mr. de Vaux; I {{shall see}} him! Don't dare <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> man!" [...] I added fiercely, as Richards laid his hand upon my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You had {{no right}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Flockley," [...] {{answered}} the girl. [...] "I told you to let me go. I--I thought you were a--a--gentleman." [...] And now the tears began to show in Minnie Sanderson's eyes.|$|E
6000|$|JULIA (stopping and turning). Ah, {{you think}} that! (She comes back.) Listen to me. If I say yes, will you promise not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> me--to give <b>me</b> time to accustom {{myself to the}} idea of our new relations? ...|$|R
5000|$|The song, {{recorded}} at Battery Studios, London, is about her {{searching for a}} man. The video featured her performing to a packed crowd wearing ripped denim jeans. During the song she pulls {{a young man from}} the crowd and teases him before moving on to someone else. A stand-out scene from the video is the close-up shot of Fox as she is heard moaning in a sexual manner.The song itself is layered with sexual lines, including: [...] "Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you, to treat my body like you wanted to" [...] and of course the chorus itself, [...] "Touch <b>me,</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> I wanna feel your body, your heartbeat next <b>to</b> mine, <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> NOW!".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you'll {{have more}} than a handful to meet--everything, every one that belongs <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that <b>touches</b> <b>me</b> near or far; my family, my blood, my heredity, my traditions, my promises, my circumstances, my prejudices; my little past--such as it is; my great future--such as it has been {{supposed}} it may be." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{caught me}} by the wrist, and forced me to look into his face. It was unwise of him <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> against my will, for the fire flashed into my eyes, and my anger gave me strength.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was playing}} with it, and it went off by itself,' said Dick, when the powder-pocked cheek {{could no longer be}} hidden, 'but if you think you're going to lick me you're wrong. You are never going <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, wasn't it awful," [...] she said. [...] "I--I don't {{know what}} you think of it. They had no right <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me.</b> I thought they were gentlemen. They have called here several times, but they never acted that way before." ...|$|E
6000|$|Huon [starting in affright]. Ha! {{spirit of}} the dead, what wouldst thou now? For long, long nights why hast thou haunted me? Cannot my agony, remorse, and tears win thee <b>to</b> forget? Ah, <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> not! Away! away! See how the vision follows. It holds me fast. Bianca, save me! save me! [Falls and dies.] ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{she heard}} her voice crisply explaining, [...] "Why, you see, mother dear, I simply had to get some work done for the office--" [...] Una was telling herself, [...] "Some day he will kiss me, and I'm not sorry he didn't to-night--not now any more I'm not.... It's so strange--I like <b>to</b> have him <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> and I simply never could stand other men <b>touching</b> <b>me!...</b> I wonder if he's excited now, too? I wonder what he's doing.... Oh, I'm glad, glad I loved his hands!" ...|$|R
60|$|The Vicomtesse withdrew in high dudgeon to her chamber, and I {{did not see}} {{her again}} that evening. Mademoiselle I saw once, for a moment, and she {{employed}} that moment <b>to</b> question <b>me</b> <b>touching</b> the origin of my quarrel with Saint-Eustache.|$|R
60|$|As I leaned my {{face against}} the bed, his feeble hand could just move itself enough <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me.</b> I hope the touch was penitent. It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak to close.|$|E
6000|$|... "The hog!" [...] {{said the}} Asika, or rather she hissed it, [...] "the hog, who dared <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> and {{to strike at}} you. Well, his time is short--would that I could make it shorter! Did you hear what he sought of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} from any we have heard from him] Say! What business had he <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me for taking my wife home-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{knew which}} {{of your hands}} was the least spoilt, I would ask you <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> <b>touch</b> it,' said Bella, 'for the last time. But not because I repent of what I have said to you. For I don't. It's true!' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{want him}} to hear me. I'm not frightened of him. I should just like <b>to</b> see him <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> now. [He sidles viciously to JOHN.] H'm, you tried to keep me out, did yer? Said I couldn't come to my sister's 'ouse--and kept me waitin' in the 'all like a tradesman. Oh, I'll make you all pay for this. I'll get my own back now.

60|$|THE MAIDEN. Nonsense! I {{care for}} you much {{more seriously than}} before; though perhaps {{not so much for}} you in particular. I mean I care more for everybody. But I don't want to touch you unnecessarily; and I {{certainly}} don't want you <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you dare}} <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me</b> I'll {{call in the}} police," [...] replied Matt, more sharply than ever. [...] "I have a license, and by that license the police are bound to protect me. Now, you get my goods back for me and I'll leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He did {{not offer}} to strike me, nor yet <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>me,</b> if you mean that: but he {{threatened}} me; and that in such awful sounding, and yet ridiculous language, that you would hardly know whether to laugh or to be angry if I could repeat it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry Furness," [...] he said, [...] "is as loyal {{a gentleman}} as draws sword in our ranks, {{and as he}} and I have been well-nigh roasted together, it were vain indeed that any {{complaint}} were made <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>touching</b> his honor. I will speak to him, however, and doubt not that his explanation will be satisfactory." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} written long ago, my dearest Miss Mitford, {{to try to}} say half the {{pleasure}} and gratitude your letter made for me, but I have been worried and anxious about the illnesses, not exactly in my family but nearly as <b>touching</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and hanging upon posts from England in a painful way inevitable to these great distances....|$|R
6000|$|... "On a base {{as broad}} as the pyramids {{of which you}} were talking at dinner. Public report, not nearly so {{misleading}} a guide as people think, your face, your voice, your eyes, all betray you. Why do you always try to get near him <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him?--answer <b>me</b> that. I have seen you do it three times this evening. Once you handed him a book in order <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> his hand beneath it; {{but there is no}} need to enumerate what you doubtless very well remember. No nice woman, Mrs. Carr, ever likes <b>to</b> continually <b>touch</b> a man unless she loves him. You are always listening for his voice and step, you are listening for them now. Your eyes follow his face as a dog does his master's--when you speak to him, your voice is a caress in itself. Shall I go on?" ...|$|R
