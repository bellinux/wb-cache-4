5|$|The {{investigation}} is triggered when Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness {{has probably been}} intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes {{a significant portion of}} the city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides.|$|E
5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Mulder has {{a fellow}} FBI agent, Barrett Weiss, visit Baker's residence. Weiss and Baker are both {{killed by the}} Bounty Hunter, who impersonates Weiss and tells Mulder and Scully <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> home. After Walter Skinner hears of Weiss' death and closes the case, the agents meet CIA {{official}} Ambrose Chapel, who tells them that the doctors are clones from a Soviet genetics program, and are being systematically killed by the Russian and U.S. governments. Mulder, Scully and Chapel head to pick up another doctor named James Dickens, but Dickens flees {{at the sight of}} Chapel, who is really the disguised Bounty Hunter. Dickens is killed by the Bounty Hunter in the subsequent pursuit, unknowingly aided by Mulder and Scully.|$|E

5|$|Scully theorizes that Gates {{has brought}} Kevin to a {{recycling}} plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God is speaking, but <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> listening.|$|E
5|$|The police {{discover}} Michael's {{location and}} surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside {{to try to}} reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael {{that it is time}} to go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{said that}} the country must ensure that as it progresses, <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> left behind, and {{to help those who}} have {{difficulty}} keeping up. He gives this reason for implementing the progress package that was given out. Lee {{said that the}} PAP government would take care of older Singaporeans and help them work longer. PAP would install elevators on every floor of every HDB block, make the city barrier free and transport system wheelchair friendly.|$|E

25|$|On July 22, 2007, the New York Times {{reported}} that Morrison took two HIV tests in 2007 {{and a third}} specifically for the Times. HIV experts reviewed the three tests {{and concluded that the}} 1996 result had been a false positive. But ringside doctors, including Nevada's chief ringside physician, expressed doubt. They implied that the negative results were not in fact based on Morrison's blood. The experts agreed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> ever cured of HIV; if the negative tests from 2007 were performed on Morrison's blood, then he had never been infected with HIV.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, this {{sacred and}} holy Synod,—considering that no small utility may accrue to the Church of God, if it be made known which {{out of all}} the Latin editions, now in circulation, of the sacred books, is to be held as authentic,—ordains and declares, that the said old and vulgate edition, which, by the {{lengthened}} usage of so many years, has been approved of in the Church, be, in public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions, held as authentic; and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> to dare, or presume to reject it under any pretext whatever.|$|E
25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

5000|$|The Bahrain {{authorities}} initially denied all {{allegations of}} torture. An official from the Ministry for Social Development told Human Rights First <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> being tortured in Bahrain, maintaining that [...] "Everyone who's been arrested {{has been shown}} an arrest warrant and proper documentation and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had <b>been</b> taken by masked men from their home".|$|R
25|$|Finally, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences {{in the organization of}} cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> left behind.|$|E
25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because he finds it very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier scared the night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature, and points readers not wanting to get upset or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

25|$|The Order of the Arrow Founder's Award {{was first}} {{introduced}} at the 1981 National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC), {{following the death of}} Goodman. This award honors Arrowmen in the Order of the Arrow (OA) for unselfish service above and beyond their normal duties to their lodge. Any lodge may present the award to up to two arrowmen annually; lodges with more than 1,000 members may present up to three awards, and lodges with more than 1,500 members may present up to four awards. No lodge may present more than four awards. If more than one Founder's Award is presented, at least one must be presented to a youth member under the age of 21. Lodges are not required to give the Founder's Award if they feel <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> worthy of it. A member may only receive the award once in his or her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Andrew Roberts {{notes that}} [...] "It {{is a curious}} fact about the Battle of Waterloo <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> absolutely certain when it actually began". Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at [...] "about ten o'clock [...] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont". Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30. The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of Guards, and the wood and park by Hanoverian Jäger and the 1/2nd Nassau.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} was {{positively}} received by television critics, and it earned 77 out of 100 on the aggregate review website Metacritic, indicating critical reception as [...] "generally favorable." [...] Reviewers reacted {{well to the}} exploration of the parallel universe, and the performances of Torv and Noble, who each played differing versions of their original characters, were lauded. Fringe ended its third season with an average of 5.83 million viewers per episode, placing 99th for the network television season. The New York Times called the series [...] "the best major-network show <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> watching." [...] Despite its low ratings, Fox renewed the series for a fourth season on March 24, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The Smithsonian Institution has {{categorized}} The Quest as both {{abstract and}} figurative. In 2002, journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a [...] "large tangle of snow-white bodies in a fountain".

As of 1990, The Quest was considered Portland's largest single piece of white sculptured marble. It was surveyed and considered [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in January 1994. Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure's nose.|$|E
500|$|According to Franklin, the {{selective}} fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced {{to attract and}} hold people's attention {{by focusing on the}} unusual over the usual.

But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there [...] "and the world is structured to believe in them."
