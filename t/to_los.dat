25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. These instructions source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI and LO, since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written <b>to</b> HI and <b>LO</b> (respectively). For division, the quotient is written <b>to</b> <b>LO</b> and the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI and Move from <b>LO)</b> is provided <b>to</b> copy the contents of HI or <b>LO</b> <b>to</b> a GPR. These instructions are interlocked: reads of HI and LO do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write <b>to</b> HI and <b>LO.</b> Another pair of instructions (Move to HI or Move <b>to</b> <b>LO)</b> copies the contents of a GPR <b>to</b> HI and <b>LO.</b> These instructions are used to restore HI and <b>LO</b> <b>to</b> their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI or LO must be separated by two instructions that do not write <b>to</b> HI or <b>LO.</b>|$|R
