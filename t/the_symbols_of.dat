5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|According to the Illuminated Chronicle, {{in order}} to secure Solomon's succession, his father {{arranged}} a meeting with Duke Béla at the royal manor in Tiszavárkony. The king proposed that his brother choose between a crown and a sword (which were <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> royal and ducal power, respectively), but had previously commanded his men to murder the duke if Béla picked the crown.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} {{national}} flag, anthem and emblem, Belarus has several unofficial symbols. The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne, a 12th-century relic which disappeared during the Second World War is considered a spiritual symbol of Belarus. The European bison, commonly called the wisent, {{is seen as a}} symbol of Belarus and the Belavezha Forest. It is also featured on <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Brest Oblast. An other widely known mascots of Belarus are stork and cornflower.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Symbol</b> <b>of</b> Chaos {{originates}} from Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion stories. In them, <b>the</b> <b>Symbol</b> <b>of</b> Chaos comprises eight arrows in a radial pattern. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Law is {{a single}} upright arrow. It is also called the Arms of Chaos, the Arrows of Chaos, the Chaos Star, the Chaos Cross, the Chaosphere, or <b>the</b> <b>Symbol</b> <b>of</b> Eight.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} temples built on Capitoline hill: {{the temple of}} Juno Moneta, the temple of Virtus, and the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus {{is the most important}} of the temples. It was built in 509 BC and was nearly as large as the Parthenon. The hill and the temple of Jupiter became <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Rome, the capital of the world.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue {{to be decided by}} the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the bill because the party already recognized both symbols as <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E

5000|$|The Community <b>of</b> Christ {{utilizes}} <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian {{cross on}} its buildings and temples. The LDS Church currently {{does not use}} the cross {{on the grounds that}} [...] "because the Savior lives, we do not use <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> His death as <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> our faith", although this aversion to the cross only became dominant in the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|The present bronze {{statue of}} Benavides {{is in front}} of the Main Building of the Sampaloc campus, rising on top of a granite {{pedestal}} flanked by four lions each bearing the coats-of-arms of the Philippines, Spain, Holy See, and the Dominican Order. He dons the rugged habit of the pioneer Dominican missionaries. His right hand is elevated in the preaching fashion, his index finger pointing to heavens. His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs from his neck, <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Episcopal dignity.|$|E
5000|$|The sickle {{is used as}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{well known}} <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hammer and sickle, which was <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Soviet Union.

5|$|Andrew {{suffered}} a stroke which paralyzed him. In an attempt to strengthen his son's claim to the throne, he had the child Solomon crowned in the one-year-long period beginning {{in the autumn of}} 1057. For the same purpose, Andrew also arranged the engagement of his son with Juditha daughter of the late Emperor Henry III, and sister of the new German monarch, Henry IV (r. 1056–1105)in September 1058. Thereafter, according to an episode narrated by most Hungarian chronicles, the king invited Duke Béla to a meeting at Tiszavárkony. At their meeting, Andrew seemingly offered his brother to freely choose between a crown and a sword, which were <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom and the ducatus, respectively. Duke Béla, who had previously been informed by his partisans in Andrew's court that he would be murdered on the king's order if he opted for the crown, chose the sword.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> Tiruchirappalli, the Rockfort is a {{fortress}} which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock. It {{consists of a}} set of monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top, and the Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for Pārvatī as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam {{at the foot of the}} Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.|$|E
5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
25|$|The ginkgo leaf is <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Urasenke {{school of}} Japanese tea ceremony. The tree is the {{official}} tree of the Japanese capital <b>of</b> Tokyo, and <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf.|$|R
50|$|The perron on {{the nearby}} Place du Marché was once <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> justice in <b>the</b> Prince-Bishopric and is now <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. It {{stands in front of}} the 17th century city hall.|$|R

5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. <b>The</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E
5|$|The poem, {{written in}} free verse in 206 lines, uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with the pastoral elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E
50|$|Manly P Hall (1901-1990), mystic and a 33rd degree mason, {{taught that}} each of the three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Judaism is a hexagram <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Saturn, and <b>the</b> day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is <b>the</b> Sun: <b>the</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Christianity is <b>the</b> cross <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun.

5|$|The two brothers' good {{relationship}} deteriorated after King Andrew had the child Solomon crowned king in 1057 or 1058. The coronation was {{the consequence of}} the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire, because the Germans did not acquiesce in a marriage between Solomon and Judiththe sister of the young German monarch, Henry IVuntil Solomon's right to succeed his father was declared and publicly confirmed. Thereafter Andrew was determined to secure the throne for his son. He invited Béla to his manor in Tiszavárkony, where the King offered his brother a seemingly free choice between a crown and a sword (which were <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the royal and ducal power, respectively). However, he had ordered that Béla be murdered if he chose the crown. Having been informed of his brother's secret plan {{by one of his}} own partisans in the royal court, Béla opted for the sword, but he departed for Poland after the meeting.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{may have}} been with the hunting party on 2 August 1100 in which King William was accidentally killed, as {{he was one of}} the {{witnesses}} to the letter sent on 5August 1100 from William IIs brother, the new King Henry I to Anselm recalling the archbishop. King Henry continued to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back Pope Paschal II's reply to a letter written by Henry immediately after his accession. Henry was seeking a reconciliation with the papacy, and confirmed to the pope the rights and obedience which his father had rendered, but he also requested the same rights within the Church as his father had enjoyed, chiefly the lay investiture of bishops and the granting of <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> episcopal authority by laymen. Paschal declined to grant Henry those rights.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the front of}} the vessel depicts six masks surrounding an anclabris. The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Congress during elections held between 1952 and 1971 was {{an image}} of two bullocks with a plough. <b>The</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Indira's Congress(R) during the period 1971–77 was a cow with a suckling calf.|$|R
