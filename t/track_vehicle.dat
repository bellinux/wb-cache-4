25|$|Tank {{steering}} systems allow a tank, {{or other}} continuous <b>track</b> <b>vehicle,</b> to turn. Because the tracks cannot be angled {{relative to the}} hull (in any operational design), steering must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), {{or a combination of}} both. The half-track avoids this by combining steerable wheels and fixed-speed tracks.|$|E

30|$|In some {{surveillance}} missions {{in the aftermath}} of disasters, the use of a teleoperated <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> contributes to the safety of rescue crews. However, because of its insufficient traversal capability, the vehicle can become trapped upon encountering rough terrain. This may lead to mission failure and, in the worst case, loss of the vehicle. To improve the success rate of such missions, {{it is very important to}} assess the traversability of a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> on rough terrains based on objective indicators. From this viewpoint, we first derived physical conditions that must be satisfied in the case of traversal on stairs, based on a simple mechanical model of a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> We then proposed a traversability assessment method for <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> on stairs. In other words, we established a method to evaluate whether or not a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> can traverse the target stairs. To validate the method, we conducted experiments with an actual <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> on our simulated stairs, and we observed some divergences between our calculation and the experimental result. Therefore, we analyzed possible factors causing these divergences, estimated the influence of the factors quantitatively by conducting additional experiments, and identified the reasons for the deviation. In this paper, we report the above-described assessment method, the experiments, and the analyses.|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{suspension}} system in <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> cannot be overestimated because the driving and running conditions of such vehicles are very severe.

As the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> running speed increases, undesired vibration could be intensified by the road profile {{particularly in the case}} of field running. Because excessive vibration can harm the operational ability of crewmen and stability of complex equipments, the maximum running speed is limited. In this study, we examined the feasibility of the preview control to improve the performance of the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> system. We proposed a method to apply a linear optimal preview control to the <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> system. To avoid the complexity of modeling the track subsystem and kinematical nonlinearity in the trailing arm suspension system, we classified these as unknown dynamics and disturbances. We used the Time Delay Control(TDC) method to make sprung mass dynamics follow that of the linear preview controlled <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> model by compensating the uncertainties and disturbances. We have verified by computer simulation that the proposed method shows good robustness to modeling uncertainty including the case when the unsprung mass is assumed to be twice heavier than the model parameters.
