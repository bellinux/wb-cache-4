50|$|To {{overcome}} these limitations the induction heating industry {{turned to the}} inductor-generator. This type of machine features a <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> constructed from a stack of punched iron laminations. The excitation and AC windings are both mounted on the stator, the rotor is therefore a compact solid construction which can be rotated at higher peripheral speeds than the standard AC generator above thus allowing it to be greater in diameter for a given RPM. This larger diameter allows {{a greater number of}} poles to be accommodated and when combined with complex slotting arrangements such as the Lorenz gauge condition or Guy slotting which allows the generation of frequencies from 1 to 10 kHz.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of cost {{reduction}} in direct-drive generators for wind turbines. Today, the combination gearbox-medium-speed (1000 - 2000 rpm) induction generator largely dominates the market of MW-scale wind turbines. This is due to the lower costs of the gearbox option compared to the costs of gearless systems. Nevertheless, there is an acute interest among researchers and wind turbine suppliers in the possibility of removing gears and slip rings from the drive train, leading to lower maintenance (no oil is required and slip rings can be avoided) and higher reliability due to the absence of wear between gears. The direction followed by the thesis is the investigation and comparison of various permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies. The aim is to identify the topology(ies) with the lowest cost/torque and highest torque/ mass. A new TFPM geometry, called TFPM machine with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor,</b> is derived in the. The new machine topology has the following characteristics: the stator is single-sided, the rotor PM and flux concentrators are independent from the build-up of mechanical tolerances, the installation of rotor parts (PM and flux concentrators) can be automated and the flux circulation allows laminated steel {{to be used in the}} stator core. A prototype of the TFPM machine with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> is presented. The comparison between TFPM machines with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> and conventional PM synchronous machines is discussed. Comparison of the cost/torque and torque/mass of the two machine topologies for diameters ranging between 0. 5 m and 3. 0 m showed favorable expected performances of the TFPM machine with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> for diameters of 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m. However, diameters larger than 1. 0 m favored the conventional PM synchronous machine with/without flux-concentration. Using the results of the optimization process, the costs of active material are computed for a 1. 5 MW wind turbine. It is found that active material represents about 5 % of the total turbine cost, while previous estimates indicated that the generator costs are rather between 30 % and 40 % of a complete direct-drive wind turbine. Therefore, further optimizaÂ¬tion of direct-drive machines should also include the costs of manufacturing and the costs of the mechanical structure.

Very small reluctance motors have low torque, and are generally used for instrumentation applications.

40|$|To {{answer the}} growing needs for super-clean or contact free {{actuators}} for uses in clean rooms, vacuum chambers, and space, innovative actuators which combine {{the functions of}} stepping motors and magnetic bearings in one body were developed. The rotor of the magnetically suspended stepping motor is suspended like a magnetic bearing and rotated and positioned like a stepping motor. The important trait of the motor {{is that it is}} not a simple mixture or combination of a stepping motor and conventional magnetic bearing, but an amalgam of a stepping motor and a magnetic bearing. Owing to optimal design and feed-back control, a <b>toothed</b> stator and <b>rotor</b> are all that are needed structurewise for stable suspension. More than ten types of motors such as linear type, high accuracy rotary type, two-dimensional type, and high vacuum type were built and tested.

40|$|The {{efficient}} use of energy enables commercial and industrial facilities to minimise production costs, increase profits, and stay competitive. The majority of electrical energy consumed in most industrial facilities is used to run electric motors. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for researchers to develop advanced electric motors with less cost and high efficiency. There has been a recent interest in flux switching motor (FSM) in which all flux sources are positioned in stator that make the rotor simple, robust, and brushless. The development of research has been with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> structures, which exploit changes of paths for the stator teeth, but this structure produces less torque and power. Hence, the use of a segmental rotor structure has been developed, which gives significant gains. The primary function of the segments is to provide a defined magnetic path for conveying the flux to adjacent armature coil in stator as the rotor rotates. This design gives shorter end-winding than with a <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> structure, which requires fully-pitched coils. Hence, permanent magnet FSM (PMFSM) and field excitation FSM (FEFSM) with segmental rotor have been developed, but due to their infirmity of less torque generation inherit from less flux linkage, a new structure of hybrid excitation FSM (HEFSM) is proposed. The proposed design HEFSM I is analysed using a commercial 2 D FEA package, JMAG-designer software. Initially, HEFSM I has been improved and optimised by using deterministic optimisation techniques and achieved torque and power of almost 48 % and 56 % more than the initial HEFSM I, and almost 3 % and 8 % more than target values respectively. Additionally, an alternate structure of HEFSM II has been proposed, investigated, and optimised. Finally, optimised HEFSM II has achieved torque and power almost 14 % and 13 % more than target values respectively. The novel structure HEFSM II with segmental rotor has produced higher performances than existing PMFSM and FEFSM, proving their suitability towards efficient and reliable motors...|$|E
40|$|Recently the {{researchers}} are much concern in flux switching motor (FSM) in which all flux producing sources are positioned in the stator with robust rotor. Development of research has been with <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> structures which exploits changes of paths for the stator teeth, whilst the bipolar flux produces the flux linkage in the stator. Yet, the flux path through teeth of rotor takes longer cycle results in less torque generation. Therefore, in more recent work researchers have developed {{the use of a}} segmental rotor construction, which gives significant gains. The primary function of the segments in this design is to provide a defined magnetic path for conveying the field flux to adjacent stator armature coils as the rotor rotates. As this design gives shorter end-windings than with the <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> structure which requires fully-pitched coils. Hence, permanent magnet FSM (PMFSM) and field excitation FSM (FEFSM) using segmental rotor have been developed. However, due to their infirmity of less torque generation inherit from less flux linkage, both existing designs have been combined and a new structure of hybrid excitation FSM (HEFSM) is proposed. With a novelty of hybrid excitation from PM and field excitation coil (FEC), the proposed design confirms smooth flux distribution over the stator and rotor, hence promising higher torque production. Additionally, the proposed design has also been improved by relocating the position of PM from tip of the stator pole to a new position sandwiched between the FEC slots. This paper also presents analysis and comparison of magnetic flux distribution, magnetic flux lines, flux strengthening and torque characteristics with existing PMFSM and FEFSM at several conditions of initial, improved and optimized designs of HEFSM. The novel structure of HEFSM using segmental rotor has attained smooth flux distribution with flux strength of 58. 6 mWb and maximum torque of 33. 8 Nm, approximately 48 % more than the initial design. The final design HEFSM with segmental rotor has also produce slightly higher performances than existing PMFSM and FEFSM, proving their suitability to be applied for hybrid electrical vehicles (EVs...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{well-known}} drawbacks of switched reluctance machines is {{the relatively high}} output torque ripple. Techniques aiming to reduce machine torque ripple either compromise the machine performance or {{the simplicity of the}} inverter and the controller. The work presented in this thesis shows that low torque ripple over a wide speed range can be achieved without severe penalties in terms of the machine performance and the size, cost and complexity of the power electronics and the controller. This is achieved by designing a 6 -phase machine and driving it from a three-phase full bridge circuit. Switched reluctance motors with segmented rotors are a relatively recent advancement in the electromagnetic design of doubly-salient reluctance motors, having only been introduced in 2002. By replacing the conventional <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> with individual segments, it has been proven that higher torque density than conventional switched reluctance machines could be achieved. Early work by Mecrow and El-Kharashi has demonstrated the operation of prototype machines with short-pitched and fully-pitched windings. The machine design work presented here builds on this early work by examining aspects of the machine design and its operation. Two six-phase machines – one with a segmented rotor and the other with a <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> - have been designed. Performance comparisons have been made between the two six-phase machines and a three phase segmented rotor machine that was previously designed at Newcastle University. Additionally, a three phase single tooth winding and a two phase segmented rotor switched reluctance machine have been studied in simulation and experimentally. Detailed comparison of inverter ratings and machine efficiencies are made under equal conditions for a 2 -phase machine driven from h-bridge and asymmetric half-bridge inverters. This is achieved with results from a test rig and the use of accurate dynamic simulation. Simulation models for 3 -phase and 6 -phase machines have also been generated. Detailed comparison of inverter ratings and machine efficiencies are made under equal conditions for the 3 -phase and 6 -phase drives in the dynamic simulation. Comparisons between simulated and measured results are shown to be very good for all of the drives. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the new design}} of Hybrid Excitation Flux Switching Motor (HEFSM) using segmental rotor structure. HEFSMs are those that consists all the excitation flux sources at their stator with robust rotor structure. The rotor is designed as segmental due to the reason that segmental rotor has ability to yield the magnetic path for conveying the field flux to nearby stator armature coil {{with respect to the}} rotation of the rotor. This design gives the clear advantage of shorter end winding compared to the <b>toothed</b> <b>rotor</b> as there is no overlap winding between field excitation coil (FEC) and armature coil. In this paper the initial design of HEFSM with segmental rotor has been improved by changing segment span, FEC slot area and armature slot area until maximum torque and power of 33. 633 Nm and 8. 17 KW respectively have been achieved.
