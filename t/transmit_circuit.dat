40|$|The {{capacity}} of an optical CDMA (OCDMA) network {{has traditionally been}} defined {{as the number of}} continuously <b>transmitting</b> <b>circuits</b> supported by the network. In this paper, we use teletraffic models to determine the teletraffic {{capacity of}} a circuit-switched OCDMA network where circuits carry bursty traffic. Our analysis is independent of the OCDMA implementation or spreading code. In conventional networks, e. g. a wavelength-routed-network (WRN), new circuits are blocked when all wavelengths are occupied. In OCDMA when the number of codewords exceeds number of network subscribers, new circuits need not be blocked. Instead, capacity is limited by multiple access interference: when the number of actively <b>transmitting</b> <b>circuits</b> becomes excessive, the BER of all circuits on the network degrades, causing an outage. We find that through statistical-multiplexing, the capacity of OCDMA exceeds that of a WRN except when circuit activity is very high while the constraints on outages are more stringent than those on blocking. In such cases, we show how OCDMA with call admission control can be used to match or exceed the capacity of a WRN. Overall, our analysis shows that OCDMA is well suited to applications when conventional blocking is undesirable, and/or circuits carry bursty traffic...|$|R
