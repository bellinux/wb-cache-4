5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
30|$|The test {{users were}} then asked to start <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BOS UI and the ESHL GUI. Since there are three roles in the BOS UI, the tasks were {{organized}} according to the responsibilities of the different roles. The participants were given different roles to complete corresponding tasks on BOS UI. In total, there were 22 <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BOS UI which are listed in Appendix “Tasks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BOS UI in the experiment”. The ESHL GUI, on the other hand, does not support multiple roles, therefore only 8 <b>tasks</b> were designed <b>for</b> this user interface. These tasks can be found in Appendix “Tasks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ESHL GUI in the experiment”. In order to prevent test users from having a preconceived prejudice against any of the both user interfaces, the evaluation website was programmed to display <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two user interfaces in different orders. More specifically, half of the test users started with <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BOS UI and another half started with <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ESHL GUI, so as to balance potential bias.|$|R

After completing a <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sea Captain, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart {{got out of it}} and boarded a ship.

5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States.|$|E
5|$|Salt mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of salt mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock salt as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock salt solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing salt. Salt mining was an arduous <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. Salt was mainly extracted from the sea and salt works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of salt lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for salt production. In Southwestern China, natural salt deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and salt were relatively low. As salt was a necessity of life for human civilization, salt mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{problems}} in Malaysia {{began in the}} late 1920s when motorised vehicles began to hover on the road that used to be covered only by bicycle, tricycle, rickshaw and bullock carts. This situation creates a new <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> police forces, which is to maintain and control the traffic. In 1928 and 1929, the traffic branch was established in big cities, which is Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Seremban. Singapore, which at that time was part of Strait States have set up traffic branch earlier, which is in 1918. In other cities, the task of controlling the traffic falls on regular general duty policemen.|$|E

It took two years to re-assemble; the vessel was finally launched on 6 June 1901 and named after Bishop Chauncy Maples, an Anglican missionary, later Bishop of Nyasaland. Tragically while on the way to take up his duties, his boat capsized during a storm on Lake Nyasa and he drowned because of the weight of his cassock.|$|E

Formula 2 was a difficult <b>task</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> small team, racing 1978 and 1979 without scoring any championship points. The early 1980s were somewhat better. AGS {{was one of the}} few teams who ran its own cars (Maurer, Minardi and Merzario were the others), and eventually the team was able to score points regularly. Soon some victories came, too. AGS made history when works driver Philippe Streiff won the final race of Formula 2 in 1984, using an AGS JH19C.|$|E

The Army was established in all parts of the country, with a significant stronghold in Troms based on the threat picture of that time: the fear of an invasion from the East. This picture definitely changed with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
