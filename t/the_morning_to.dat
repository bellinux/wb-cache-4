5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E
5|$|Roseville Tower was the {{interlocking}} {{tower at}} street-level in Roseville that handled the nearby {{fork of the}} three lines (Montclair, Morristown and Gladstone). The tower was used on limited services, with only three different shifts, two of which were manned. The tower was run from 5 a.m. in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> 10 p.m. in the evening manned. The rest of the time, the tower was set on automatic.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each {{direction}} at intervals of one hour from around 7am to around 11pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and B Class locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains each morning ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes from start to finish. On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day ran and there was a three-hour gap in services in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> allow the railway's staff to attend church.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either at three in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E

5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at seven in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{the worst of the}} heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
5|$|When the ducklings {{were ready}} for slaughter, the duckers would {{generally}} kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally take place in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>to</b> ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in {{those parts of the}} body from which the feathers had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.|$|E

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|At the {{vernal equinox}} of 1930, Fortune {{declared}} that—with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established—she {{wanted to turn}} away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development. At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, {{while at the same time}} other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> the evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune's literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.|$|E
5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is showering, a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E
