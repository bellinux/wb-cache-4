40|$|The {{efficacy}} of pheromone traps {{is affected by}} trap placement and pest biology, {{as well as by}} the trap and lure design. We evaluated the effect of trap height and placement in relation to surfaces on <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth</b> catches using release-capture experiments. Six traps were mounted vertically in a 9 × 15 × 4. 2 - 5. 8 m shed on a wall at heights of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m. More catches were obtained near the ceiling and at 1 m above the floor in the dark. Catches at 1 m were negligible when light shone through the upper windows. In a 42. 3 × 36. 5 × 4 m tobacco warehouse, the respective efficacies of aerially suspended traps and surface-mounted traps were examined. The number of catches obtained using traps mounted on pillars was significantly higher than that obtained in traps suspended from poles. These results suggest practical considerations for monitoring in warehouses. We recommend eliminating any night lighting and placing traps on surfaces, such as walls and stored commodities, at higher positions that are within reach (1 m) to facilitate convenient inspection...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{behaviour}} is tightly {{connected to}} their ability to detect important sensory information from their environment. The <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth</b> Heliothis virescens moth follows airborne stimuli to acquire partners, food and suitable host plants for oviposition, and it is able to detect sounds allowing them to escape predation by bats. Understanding the underlying biological mechanisms behind its behavioural choices may be of importance in future methods for harmless biological control. In this present study, neurons of three bilateral protocerebral neurons in the moth H. virescens were chosen based on their electrophysiological responses and successful staining. The neurons were reconstructed using the manual labelling software Slicer, and registered into the standard brain atlas (SBA) using landmark registering in Amira. The neuron N 1 which responded to an odorant (linalool) and the neuron N 2 which responded to a sound stimulus (keychain) were both suggested to participate in reciprocal inhibition. This was due to their projection in corresponding areas in the contralateral hemisphere. N 1 had its input in the left and output in the right LAL, and N 2 descended from the VLP through the SOG towards the thoracic ganglion. Contrast enhancement between the sides may be important for localising a sound or odor in space. The neuron N 3 innervated one glomerulus in each hemisphere before branching into the ventral protocerebrum, the right eye lobe and an area below the central body. This neuron was found to respond consistently to the major pheromone component and to novel stimuli of a sound and a light stimulus. This novelty detection may be important for focusing attention, and detecting important biologically relevant stimuli from the background noise in the environment. </p...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the insect}} species causing infestations and serious damages to stored commodities, the {{cigarette}} beetle, Lasiodermaserricorne (F.) and the <b>tobacco</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestiaelutella (Hübner) {{are the major}} pests of both raw and manufactured tobacco. Post-harvest tobacco control is achieved through sanitation, insect monitoring, and fumigation with phosphine. However, insect resistance to phosphine and control failures have been reported, and increasing regulatory pressure is being exerted on fumigants. Biological control agents such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) appear to be environmentally sound and potentially viable alternatives to chemical control. Bt is a bacterium that produces insecticidal crystal proteins during the sporulation phase and has been, for more than 40 years, the microorganism of choice for the biocontrol of phytophagous insect pests. It produces insecticidal crystal proteins that display specific activity against certain orders of insects and become active upon ingestion by the insect. Our laboratory has conducted extensive research and worldwide surveys to evaluate the presence of Bt in stored tobacco and has confirmed previous findings indicating that Bt may be {{considered part of the}} naturally occurring phylloplanemicroflora. Several Bt strains were isolated from tobacco and characterized by DNA and protein profiling. The insecticidal activity of selected strains and of two commercial products against the larvae of L. serricorne was determined by diet incorporation assays. Moreover, the stability of Bt spores and crystal proteins on cured tobacco leaves was assessed over a storage period of time of 30 months. Cigarette prototypes were made with Bt-treated tobacco. Standard cigarette and smoke evaluations did not show any significant difference between the test and control cigarettes. Although the tested Bt strains and products did not yield satisfactory levels of mortality at the required times and doses, the experimental results summarized in the present review indicate that B. thuringiensishas potential for the control of the cigarette beetle. The integration of conventional control approaches with novel systems based on biological agents with different modes of action should offer new avenues for the effective management of stored tobacco pests in line with integrated pest management (IPM) concepts...|$|E

Mass spectra clearly suggest a completely identical processing of the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide-precursor in the mandibular, maxillary and labial neuromeres of the subesophageal ganglion. Only in the pban-neurons of the labial neuromere, products of two neuropeptide genes, namely the pban-gene and the capa-gene, were detected. Both of these genes expressed, amongst others, sequence-related neuropeptides (extended WFGPRLamides). We speculate that {{the expression of the}} two neuropeptide genes is a plesiomorph character typical of moths. A detailed examination of the neuroanatomy and the peptidome of the (two) pban-neurons in the labial neuromere of moths with homologous neurons of different insects indicates a strong conservation of the function of this neuroendocrine system. In other insects, however, the labial neurons either express products of the fxprl-gene or products of the capa-gene. The processing of the respective genes is reduced to extended WFGPRLamides in each case and yields a unique peptidome in the labial cells.

Even at this short feeding duration, rhodamine was detectable in > 50 % of males 5 days after feeding stopped. Longer exposure to the dye significantly increased the percentage stained. Detection of rhodamine was slightly enhanced by the use of ultraviolet light.

40|$|Larvae of the {{polyphagous}} <b>tobacco</b> cutworm <b>moth,</b> Spodoptera litura (S. litura), encounter potentially toxic allelochemicals in food. It {{is therefore}} important for S. litura to produce detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s). In this study, {{we have identified}} two novel cytochrome P 450 genes of S. litura, named CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that they belong to the CYP 321 A subfamily. Expression levels of these genes at different development stages were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The highest expression {{was found in the}} midgut and the fat body. Larvae fed with a diet supplemented with xanthotoxin or coumarin showed a strongly increased expression of CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9 in the midgut and fat body as compared to larvae that consumed a control diet. In contrast, larvae consuming a diet containing aflatoxin B 1 or quercetin did not induce the expression of these genes. CYP 321 A 7 and CYP 321 A 9 showed different expression profiles with respect to certain allelochemicals. For example, a diet containing cinnamic acid stimulated the expression of CYP 321 A 9, whereas no changes were observed for CYP 321 A 7.

40|$|To {{investigate}} tissue-specific developmental {{regulation of}} mitochondrial biogenesis, we studied {{the expression of}} the Manduca sexta (<b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>moth)</b> thoracic muscle cytochrome c gene during adult eclosion and used this information to obtain a cDNA clone for this gene, which in turn was used to isolate the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster gene. Over the 3 days prior to adult Manduca emergence, mitochondrial inner membranes become progressively more electron dense and lamellar, and, while there is no accumulation of apocytochrome c, the amount of the holoprotein increases 40 -fold per insect thorax. As determined by in vitro translation and blot hybridization analysis, the major thoracic muscle cytochrome c gene is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, with cytochrome c mRNA increasing from less than 0. 01 % to 0. 04 % of total poly(A) + RNA and declining to an undetectable level by day 2 after eclosion. Furthermore, the ratio of cytochrome c to the other cytochromes remains the same at all times, indicating that these components of the respiratory chain follow coordinated developmental programs. By using polysome immunoadsorption, a poly(A) + RNA population of {{greater than or equal to}} 95 % cytochrome c mRNA was isolated from thoracic muscle tissue and was used to construct a cDNA library, which was screened by hybrid selection/translation.

40|$|The capa peptide family, {{originally}} {{identified in}} the <b>tobacco</b> hawk <b>moth,</b> Manduca sexta, is now known {{to be present in}} many insect families, with increasing publications on capa neuropeptides each year. The physiological actions of capa peptides vary depending on the insect species but capa peptides have key myomodulatory and osmoregulatory functions, depending on insect lifestyle, and life stage. Capa peptide signaling is thus critical for fluid homeostasis and survival, making study of this neuropeptide family attractive for novel routes for insect control. In Dipteran species, including the genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster, capa peptide action is diuretic; via elevation of nitric oxide, cGMP and calcium in the principal cells of the Malpighian tubules. The identification of the capa receptor (capaR) in several insect species has shown this to be a canonical GPCR. In D. melanogaster, ligand-activated capaR activity occurs in a dose-dependent manner between 10 − 6 and 10 − 12  M. Lower concentrations of capa peptide do not activate capaR, either in adult or larval Malpighian tubules. Use of transgenic flies in which capaR is knocked-down in only Malpighian tubule principal cells demonstrates that capaR modulates tubule fluid secretion rates and in doing so, sets the organismal response to desiccation. Thus, capa regulates a desiccation-responsive pathway in D. melanogaster, linking its role in osmoregulation and fluid homeostasis to environmental response and survival. The conservation of capa action between some Dipteran species suggests that capa’s role in desiccation tolerance may not be confined to D. melanogaster...|$|R

40|$|A major {{component}} of the sex pheromone from the <b>tobacco</b> budworm <b>moth</b> Heliothis virescens is a C 16 straight-chain aldehyde with a single unsaturation at the eleventh position. The sex pheromones are inactivated when metabolized to their corresponding acids by insect aldehyde dehydrogenase. During this investigation it was demonstrated that the C 16 aldehyde is a good substrate for human aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 3) isoenzymes E 1 and E 2 with Km and Kcat. values at pH 7. 0 of 2 microM and 0. 4 mumol of NADH/min per mg and of 0. 6 microM and 0. 24 mumol of NADH/min per mg respectively. A vinyl ketone analogue of the pheromone inhibited insect pheromone metabolism; it also inactivated human aldehyde dehydrogenase. Total inactivation of both isoenzymes was achieved at stoichiometric (equal or less than the subunit number) concentrations of vinyl ketone, incorporating 2. 1 - 2. 6 molecules/molecule of enzyme. Substrate protection was observed {{in the presence of}} the parent aldehyde and 5 '-AMP. Peptide maps of tryptic digests of the E 2 isoenzyme modified with 3 H-labelled vinyl ketone showed that incorporation occurred into a single peptide peak.

The label was incorporated into cysteine- 302 in the primary structure of E 2 isoenzyme, thus indicating that cysteine- 302 is located in the aldehyde substrate area of the active site of aldehyde dehydrogenase.

40|$|The {{wings of}} pharate adult <b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>moths,</b> Manduca sexta, are {{relatively}} inextensible until 3 or 4 h before emergence from the pupal case. At {{this time the}} wing cuticle becomes plasticized, {{so that by the}} time of eclosion, the wings are readily extensible. This change in the mechanical properties of the wing cuticle is shown to be under the control of a factor from the head. This factor is present in the corpora cardiaca/corpora allata complex, and in the protocerebrum of the brain, being released into the blood prior to eclosion. It is able to act directly on isolated wings. The active principle was found to be indistinguishable {{in a number of ways}} from the hormone which triggers emergence from the pupal case, the eclosion hormone. Partial purification of the eclosion hormone failed to separate activity causing eclosion from activity causing wing cuticle plasticization. It is concluded that the same hormone is probably responsible for both effects. The cuticle plasti-cizing activity of the eclosion hormone forms the basis for a new, highly sensitive bioassay. Another factor, distinct from the eclosion hormone, is able to cause wing cuticle plasticization. This factor is found in the abdominal nerve cord, and is only released into the blood after eclosion has occurred. It is probably identical with the tanning hormone, bursicon, which is released at this time. The factor in the nerve cord which causes cuticle plasticization is indistinguishable from bursicon in a number of ways, including partial purification by gel filtration. Bursicon evidently causes a further increase in wing cuticle extensibility after eclosion, at the time of wing inflation...|$|R

40|$|Providing {{favourable}} {{and secure}} conditions that benefit the offspring is an ubiquitous struggle among the world’s creatures. For herbivorous insects that don’t provide parental care to their offspring {{the choice of}} host plants is crucial for reproductive success. Various factors influence the performance of herbivores and {{have been shown to}} shape the choice of egg laying substrates. Among the chemical senses, olfaction {{plays a key role in}} host location for many insects. However, still little is known about the impact of olfaction on the choice among available, more or less suitable host plants. The <b>tobacco</b> hawk <b>moth,</b> Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), is a model species for olfaction, host and food search. During the studies presented in this thesis, I investigated to which extend plant odours mediate host choice at the behavioural, sensory, and processing level. This thesis presents insights into egg laying preferences, chemical identity of olfactory cues, their detection by olfactory sensilla and processing of choice‐mediating sensory input in the antennal lobe, the first centre evaluating olfactory information in the insect brain. The data demonstrate that vegetative plant volatiles suffice to mediate the choice of host species. Thus, olfaction is essential for M. sexta females, to locate, evaluate and accept host plants for egg deposition. The females perform their host choice using a host-specific olfactory ‘gestalt’, which is mainly dependent on blend composition but can be influenced by signal intensity as well. The preference for intact over feeding damaged host plants is host species-specific thereby reflecting particular characteristics of the respective herbivore-host relationship. A highly sophisticated olfactory system, which is extremely well tuned to extract information from volatile signals, ensures the selection of host plants that will most probably provide reproductive success to the ovipositing female...|$|R
40|$|The {{sense of}} smell is the {{evolutionary}} oldest sense, {{and the ability to}} detect and respond to chemical signals is the primary window for perceiving the external world for most animal species. In this study, the <b>tobacco</b> budworm <b>moth,</b> Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was used as a model organism to study the neural system linked to olfaction. The second order level of the olfactory pathway in this species includes three main tracts conveying information from the antennal lobe to higher brain areas. Two of the three parallel tracts are relatively well described in moths; thus, the most prominent one, the medial antennal-lobe tract, is known to innervate the calyces of the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn whereas the medio-lateral tract projects directly to the lateral horn without making any connection to the calyces. The third tract, the lateral one, on the other hand, is less well described. In particular, the portion of lateral-tract axons forming a direct connection with the calyces has not been systematically studied in any moth species so far. The main aim of the current project was therefore to map the fraction of lateral-tract neurons linked to the calyces. The data were obtained by visualizing the second-order neurons via mass-staining. Both retrograde (from the antennal lobe) and anterograde staining (from the calyces) were used, plus {{a combination of the two}} techniques. Most of the preparations were double-labelled (simultaneously stained from the antennal lobe and the calyces). The results, comprising high-resolution confocal images, showed that most of the neurons in the lateral antennal lobe tract terminate in the lateral horn. At most, six neurons connecting this tract to the calyces were found. Thus, in moths, the connection between the antennal lobe and the calyces is primarily made up by projection neurons confined to the medial antennal lobe tract...|$|R
40|$|Microvitellogenin is {{a female}} {{specific}} yolk protein from the <b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>moth</b> Manduca sexta. A cDNA library was constructed from poly (A) ⁺ RNA isolated from adult female fat body. cDNA clones of mRNA for microvitellogenin were isolated by screening the cDNA library with antiserum against microvitellogenin. The results of Northern blot analysis and hybrid selection {{indicated that the}} cDNA clone was specific for microvitellogenin. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 834 base pair cDNA insert has been determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared with the N-terminal sequence determined by Edman degradation, an amino terminal extension of 17 amino acids {{appeared to be a}} signal peptide. The cDNA sequence predicts that the mature microvitellogenin is a protein of 232 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 26, 201. A comparison of the translated amino acid sequence with the sequences in National Biomedical Research Foundation protein library did not establish any sequence similarity with known proteins. The microvitellogenin gene begins to be expressed in the fat body {{on the first day of}} the wandering (prepupal) females as determined by using the cDNA insert as a probe to hybridize with the mRNA for microvitellogenin. The cDNA probe was also used to screen a genomic library of M. sexta, yielding three genomic clones for microvitellogenin. One of them was characterized and it contained the complete microvitellogenin gene. The gene sequence was determined. Comparison to the cDNA sequence showed that the microvitellogenin gene contains an intron near the 5 '-end of the non-coding region. The 5 '-flanking sequence of the gene has been compared to the same regions of yp genes of Drosophila and vitellogenin genes of locust, some similar sequences have been observed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Insects produce pheromones as a {{chemical}} communication system to facilitate reproduction. These highly active chemical attractants have been synthesized {{for some of}} the most important insect pests, including the boll weevil, gypsy <b>moth,</b> codling <b>moth,</b> <b>tobacco</b> budworm, European corn borer, and several bark beetles. While none of the synthetic sex attractants have yet been developed for use in insect control, they offer opportunities for the future both as control agents and to greatly improved insect detection. Investigations are underway on insect trapping systems employing the phermones and on air permeation techniques to disrupt insect reproduction. The pheromones are generally highly species-specific and are not likely to pose hazards to nontarget organisms in the environment. Toxicological studies indicate that they are low in toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish, but adequate toxicological data are necessary before they can be registered for use in insect control. Another new class of compounds called kaironomes has been discovered. These chemicals are involved in the detection of hosts or prey by insect parasites and predators. Kairomones may prove useful in manipulating natural or released biological agents for more effective biological control of insect pests. No information is yet availabl...|$|R
40|$|All mouse splenic B cells, {{including}} small resting B cells, {{process and}} present the native globular protein antigens, pigeon and <b>tobacco</b> hornworm <b>moth</b> cytochromes c, to a cytochrome c-specific T-cell hybrid {{in a major}} histocompatibility complex-restricted fashion, in the micromolar to nanomolar antigen-concentration range. As {{is the case for}} macrophages, treatment with paraformaldehyde or the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and ammonium chloride blocked processing of the native pigeon protein but did not affect the presentation of a carboxyl-terminal peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c (residues 81 - 104) which contained the T-cell antigenic determinant. However, in contrast to macrophages, whose antigen-processing and -presentation functions are insensitive to radiation, radiation blocked the processing of the native protein but not the presentation of the peptide fragment. The processing and presentation function of the B cells was augmented by F(ab') 2 of rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibodies, in that 1 / 10 th to 1 / 30 th as many cells and 1 / 10 th as much antigen were required to maximally activate the T-cell hybrid. This augmentation {{did not appear to be}} due to either crosslinking of the Ig receptors or to B-cell activation, as monovalent Fab fragments were nearly as effective as the bivalent reagent, and the concentrations of F(ab') 2 anti-Ig used did not induce measurable proliferative responses. Furthermore, enhancement can occur in the absence of cytochrome c binding and internalization, since B cells that were fixed with paraformaldehyde after treatment with F(ab') 2 anti-Ig were more effective in presenting the carboxyl-terminal peptide than were untreated fixed cells. The same phenomenon followed the binding of an irrelevant antigen (carboxydinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin) by antigen-binding B cells, resulting in enhanced processing and/or presentation of native pigeon cytochrome c. Thus, nonspecific enhancement of antigen processing and presentation can be obtained by either antigen or anti-Ig binding to the B-cell antigen receptor, both treatments presumably delivering the same signal without requiring internalization of the specifically bound antigen for subsequent processing...|$|R
