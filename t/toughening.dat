25|$|During her {{tenure as}} Minister for Immigration, Verdonk had {{specifically}} cited {{the rejection of}} those 26,000 persons {{as an example of}} her <b>toughening</b> of the immigration laws (see Policy below). The motion was passed with a 75-74 majority, the VVD, Prime Minister Balkenende's CDA, and the right-wing PVV and SGP parties dissenting. Both Verdonk, although now considered a 'caretaker', and Prime Minister Balkenende criticized the motion. There was speculation that Verdonk resigned for this reason. On December 3, after several meetings, the cabinet decided not to honor the motion, because an amnesty would be impossible to implement. It agreed to postpone expulsion of asylum seekers until after a special parliamentary session to be held on December 12.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a harmonic component monitoring technique {{to study the}} aging of <b>toughened</b> glass insulators.

The new and aged <b>toughened</b> glass insulators' power spectrums are compared to obtain the desired result.

25|$|UVA {{light has}} been shown to cause DNA damage, but not directly, like UVB and UVC. Due to its longer wavelength, it is absorbed less and reaches deeper into skin layers, where it {{produces}} reactive chemical intermediates such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals, which in turn can damage DNA and result in a risk of melanoma. The weak output of black lights, however, is not considered sufficient to cause DNA damage or cellular mutations in the way that direct summer sunlight can, although there are reports that overexposure to the type of UV radiation used for creating artificial suntans on sunbeds can cause DNA damage, photoaging (damage to the skin from prolonged exposure to sunlight), <b>toughening</b> of the skin, suppression of the immune system, cataract formation and skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|Hopes and {{expectations}} for the 1939–40 team were high, as {{all but one of}} the key players returned from the previous season's SWC champion and NCAA Tournament squad. Texas opened the season with seven wins by an average of 18 points (and by no fewer than 11), including two wins over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a home series that marked the first meetings between the two schools in basketball. Gray was intent both upon raising national recognition of the program and upon <b>toughening</b> his team in the early part of the season for the conference slate ahead, and to both ends he sought to involve the Longhorns in intersectional competition against prominent teams in high-profile venues across the country. Ned Irish, director of Madison Square Garden and a pioneer in the promotion of college basketball in the 1930s, had invited Gray's Longhorns to play Manhattan College as part of a doubleheader that included Southern California and Long Island University. The UT Athletic Council agreed to fund the team's trip to New York for the contest, followed by a stop in Philadelphia to play Temple. In front of 18,425 fans, the Longhorns overwhelmed Manhattan by a score of 54–32, earning the praise of the New York sports media and basketball fans for their speed and the accuracy of their one-handed shooting, which Gray had popularized as a player and continued teaching as a coach. Continuing on to Philadelphia, Texas fell 47–37 to Temple, winners of the first National Invitation Tournament two years prior. Having lost one of two road contests against Arkansas and a road game against SMU in overtime, Texas entered the penultimate game of the season at 18–3 and tied at 8–2 in conference play with the preseason conference favorite Rice Owls—a team that the Longhorns had defeated on Rice's home court earlier in the season, 50–46. In front of a raucous pro-Texas crowd of more than 8,000 fans packed into Gregory Gymnasium, the Longhorns suffered a heartbreaking one-point loss to the Owls, 42–41, to see their hopes of winning a second consecutive outright SWC championship dashed and their chances of even sharing the championship greatly diminished. Another painful defeat followed in the final game of the season, as the Longhorns fell to a 10–11 Texas A team in College Station, 53–52, on a long running shot from the Aggies' backup center in the final seconds. Texas finished 18–5 with no invitation to a postseason tournament. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively assigned the 1939–40 Longhorn team a national ranking of No. 17.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{reversible}} and <b>toughened</b> thermoset system based on the covalent incorporation of a furane functionalized ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM-Fu) into a thermoset furane functionalized polyketone (PK-Fu) via Diels-Alder (DA) reversible cross-linking with bismaleimide (b-MA). FT-IR and DSC analyses proved the reversible interaction between PK-Fu and EPM-Fu with b-Ma via DA and r-DA sequence. Likewise, thermo-mechanical experiments (DMTA) indicated the re-workability of the material with no evident differences in elastic and loss modulus after several heating cycles and recycling procedures. Moreover, a considerable increase in the softening point (tangent 6) was also found for the higher <b>toughened</b> system containing 12 wt% of EPM-Fu (neat thermoset T = 137 degrees C whereas <b>toughened</b> thermoset T = 155 degrees C). A two-fold increase in IZOD impact strength compared to the neat thermoset (up to 27 J/m) was also recorded by the <b>toughened</b> system. Overall, this approach clearly indicates that fully thermally reversible and <b>toughened</b> thermosets can be realized starting from mixtures of furan functionalized polyketone and EPM rubber, cross-linked via reversible Diels-Alder chemistry.
