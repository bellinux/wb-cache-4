Two types of negative-relief features have been identified according to their circular or elongated morphology. Circular-like shapes match with pockmark and scour mark morphologies. The pockmarks are placed at the N and NW of the Avempace Seamount from 672 to 740 m water depth. 48 pockmarks have been described and they al 1 display V-shaped cross-section. They are 1 - 19 m high and 50 - 400 m wide and but only some show higher backscatter than the surrounding areas. The scour marks occur isolated or clustered in the surroundings of the Herradura Seamount at 750 - 900 water depth. These negative-relief features are both V- and U-shaped in cross-sections. Ushaped scour marks display flat-bottom and truncated reflectors along their walls. Elongated-like shapes match with <b>tectonic</b> <b>depressions</b> and furrows. <b>Tectonic</b> <b>depressions</b> are NNE-SSW linear features, isolated and forming groups with a rhombshape distribution, that locate at 650 - 1, 000 m water depth. The furrows are smallsized erosive ENE-WSW features 1 - 5 m high and 200 m wide, located at the NW of Avempace and Herradura seamounts from 720 to 900 m water depth. They show Ushaped cross-section running parallel the regional slope. The pockmark formation is attributed to the escape of seepage of gas and interstitial fluids from contourite sediments they affect. The Pockmark field location could be also related to normal basement faults that have favoured the upward migration of the fluid following pre-existing pathways. Scour marks are associated with the vorticity arising when bottom currents flow around a seamount. Upstream of the seamount, a turbulence are develops favouring the whirls occurrence that erode seafloor creating the scour marks. <b>Tectonic</b> <b>depressions</b> are related to the vertical displacement of a NNW-SSE strike-slip fault system and associated to seafloor rupture along the Pliocene Quaternary Faults that have affected even the most recent sediments.

40|$|A {{combination}} of multispectral, thermal and microwave {{data obtained from}} space and supported by ground measurements are used to investigate the surface sediment characteristics of a desert plain area in Egypt (El-Gallaba Plain, NW of Aswan). This plain once hosted an ancestral river system that is nowadays largely covered by aeolian and gravelly sands, and thus, only detectible with radar and thermal images. The methodology consists of extracting thermo-physical and textural parameters to guide and improve supervised spectral classification results. The results show that surface mineralogy (obtained from spectral information) correlates strongly with surface emissivity, whereas grain size and surface roughness strongly correlates with apparent thermal inertia. Furthermore, several broad strips of thermal cooling-anomalies are arranged in a linear fashion and diagonally crossing the alluvial basin. The sediments within these strips show very different textural, thermo-physical and compositional characteristics {{with respect to the}} surrounding areas suggesting that they were deposited under different depositional environments such as structurally controlled linear basins.

Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL), the western margin of Fossa Magna is a boundary between two tectonic provinces along the inner side of NEJ and SWJ. Abrupt lateral variations in {{thickness of the}} Middle to Upper Miocene strata are quite significant among these provinces in the North Fossa Magna. The development of the thrust/fold belt is attributed not only to horizontal compression but also to vertical block movements as basement-involved tectonics. In response to the Pliocene and later compression regime, the old fault-block boundaries were reactivated and produced differential block movement such as the tilting of the Central Upheaval Zone and uplifting of the Nishikubiki Belt. One possible model for the deeper geologic structure is presented that high-angled block faults on the surface among tectonic provinces originate in vertical weak zones in the deep seismogenic zone under the sedimentary layer. The folded Neogene system comprises the present-day thrust-fault province of the North Fossa Magna and the stress regime of strikeslip faulting occupies the basement, as inferred from focal mechanism solutions for small events.

Tectonic activity, producing E-W and NW-SE trending faults, afected the area since half-graben formation up to present times.

Cavernous karren and subcutaneous kluftkarren, {{are covered with}} terra rossa and show the activity of water. They are developed in the epikarstic zone due to the diffused corrosion on the joints through a capillary aquifer, situated in the high vadose zone. The rounded tops and the cavities of those subcutaneous karren are formed due to the continuous and uniform corrosion, acting by soil moisture in the high part of the epikarstic zone. Karstic hollowforms are developed in carbonate layers only, and also on the contact of karstifi ed and non-karstifi ed but easily erodable rocks.
