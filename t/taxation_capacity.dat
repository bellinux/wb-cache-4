40|$|There is {{a demand}} for safe assets, either {{government}} bonds or private substitutes, for use as collateral. Government bonds are safe assets, given the government’s power to tax, but their supply is driven by fiscal considerations, and does not necessarily meet the private demand for safe assets. Unlike the government, the private sector cannot produce riskless collateral. When the private sector reaches its limit (the quality of private collateral), government bonds are net wealth, up to the governments own limits (<b>taxation</b> <b>capacity).</b> The economy is fragile {{to the extent that}} privately-produced safe assets are relied upon.

Taxation may be general (e.g. income tax), local (e.g. sales tax or land value tax) or variable (e.g. fuel tax), and user fees may be tolls, congestion charges or fares). The method of funding often attracts strong political and public debate.|$|R
40|$|The {{late twentieth}} century {{witnessed}} significant shifts in the institutions and processes of governance in most members states of the OECD, as direct provision (sometimes characterised as welfare state governance) was, to some degree, displaced {{by the rise of}} the regulatory state. Changes in the nature of state intervention have been accompanied also by fundamental challenges to traditional conceptions of the centrality of the nation state as regards its dominance of key resources (notably <b>taxation</b> and <b>capacities</b> for coercion) and for the maintenance {{of the rule of law}} and democracy, as transnational and non-state power have assumed greater significance. In this paper I assess both narrow and broad versions of the challenge presented to the values of constitutionalism by regulatory governance. The narrow constitutionalist critique locates the problem of regulatory governance with the delegation of governmental power to regulatory agencies. A broader constitutionalist critique looks beyond delegation to other organs of the state, and notes that the de-centring of regulatory governance has increasingly implicated both non-state and supranational governmental bodies in regulatory tasks through implicit and explicit delegation and through the assumption of regulatory powers with little or no state involvement. I suggest that one response to the broad critique is to institutionalise broader modes of control and accountability which are best able to match the governance powers which are targeted. regulation; governance; rule of law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theory explaining how trade policy is {{contingent on the}} development of fiscal capacity. The paper investigates the conditions under which mercantilism is adopted as a substitute for <b>taxation</b> when fiscal <b>capacity</b> is weak, when mercantilist revenue is reinvested in devel-oping fiscal capacity, and when economies endogenously abandon mercantilist practices and embrace free trade. If mercantilism is pursued when the stock of fiscal capacity is too low, the economy eventually falls into a protectionist trap, characterized by low income and low taxes. If mer-cantilism is adopted when the initial stock is large enough, then mercantilist revenue is invested in the expansion of the fiscal bureaucracy of the state. Eventually, the economy moves from the mercantilist-equilibrium to the free trade-equilibrium, where both income and taxes are high. The empirical implications of the model are examined against historical European data from 1820 to 1950...|$|R
40|$|The Kantian {{thought had}} {{advanced}} {{the idea that}} wars and military expenditure should decrease as long as democracy widens across the World. Historical evidence seems to invalidate this wisdom because frequency of wars is ncreasing over time and {{a large amount of}} public resources is still being committed to military spending. This paper contributes to explain this point by considering the effect of polity regimes on the military spending during the period 1880 - 1938. Indeed, before World War I the more democratic countries spent more for military purposes than autocracies whereas the reverse is true after 1920. This puzzling behaviour is therefore explained by the inconsistent timing between the ability of a state to drain resources by <b>taxation</b> (state fiscal <b>capacity)</b> and the political participation. Thus, the Kantian idea of a democratic and peaceful world seems to hold only for full democracy with large political participation. ...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>taxation</b> on state <b>capacity</b> and {{accountability}} through comparative case studies of Angola and Mozambique between 1975 and 2013. Extremes of violence and economic dependency dominate the postcolonial histories of Angola and Mozambique. These cases provide an ideal setting for comparative analysis of how civil war and single resource dependence influence the links between taxation and statebuilding. The thesis demonstrates, in contrast to bellicist notions, that civil war did not strengthen the tax systems or create stronger states. Rather, transitions from the colonial capitalist regimes to socialism and then towards market capitalism, {{as well as the}} availability of autonomous income sources, were the central drivers of change in extractive processes. The research establishes taxation as both a critical explanation for development trajectories and a reflection of state capacity and accountability. Existing research on taxation and statebuilding in contemporary developing countries tends to treat tax as a catalyst for democracy, but I find that it provides political regimes with an equally powerful tool to expand power through neopatrimonial networks and consolidate control over the state. Analysis of the case studies concludes that, driven by extraverted elite accumulation strategies, vast oil resources in Angola and large-scale foreign aid in Mozambique worked similarly to disconnect state finances from society and undermine the potential links between revenue collection and redistribution, thereby reducing the possibility of enhanced state capacity or accountability...|$|R

The challenge from aging is becoming more pressing, calling for sustained fiscal consolidation. The elaboration of a medium-term fiscal framework based on expenditure growth ceilings will help underpin the achievement of budget objectives. The focus on job creation has triggered helpful initiatives but further, comprehensive labor market reform is needed to raise employment rates. An acceleration of product market reform will provide an impetus to growth.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a the UNRISD project on The Politics of Domestic Resource Mobilization. Its {{specific}} contribution is with regards to the interaction between fiscal performance and donor aid allocation in developing countries. While several studies have examined whether aid affects fiscal performance, there has been no systematic study of whether fiscal capacity and performance in developing countries has any impact on donor aid allocation decisions. This paper argues that the latter is an important issue, given that domestic resource mobilization (DRM) is being increasingly recognized as an important component of financing for development, and that some donors are beginning {{to pay more attention to}} <b>taxation</b> and fiscal <b>capacity.</b> After reviewing the fiscal performance and aid allocation literature, the paper discusses the results of a large N-analysis for the period 1992 - 2010 that augments a standard aid allocation model with fiscal variables. This preliminary analysis of overall bilateral and multilateral aid allocation leads to the conclusion that there is hardly any correlation between overall aid and fiscal performance and capacity. This analysis is complemented by discussing the recent fiscal performance data and donor involvement in taxation and public financial management (PFM) in four case study countries. These case studies allow an examination of donor-recipient relationships. Specifically, the authors calculate a tax effort index for recipient countries over the period 1990 - 2012 and examine trends in various fiscal performance metrics. The paper also highlights which donors are present in the case study countries, and what their perceptions of fiscal performance in these countries are. The analysis shows that there are important gaps in terms of donors delivering on their commitments to align with recipient country priorities and providing aid through country PFM systems...|$|R
40|$|Financing public {{transport}} through public funds {{is a common}} practice that can be justified on different grounds: equity, natural monopoly and, particularly with the increasing motorization rate, externalities produced by private transport (congestion, pollution, road accidents) especially in urban areas. In addition, there is a belief that transport investments support economic growth, in particular transit investments because they help fostering the agglomeration effect. Whether local or national tax sources {{should be used for}} subsidizing {{public transport}} is a fairly recent question, at least in Europe where, historically, countries used to be very centralized. Several national policy reviews as well as academic papers suggest that the reforms aiming at decentralizing power and responsibility for urban public transport management lead to successful outcomes. Yet, there is no literature on the effects of decentralization of tax raising on public transport provision although an increasing number of subnational governments reports a mismatch between transferred resources and devolved responsibilities and the public finance literature indicates that decentralization of finance authority can improve the results of decentralization reforms. (cont.) The objective of this thesis, thus, is to test if the theoretical benefits of fiscal decentralization (i. e. decentralization of taxing power in addition to management responsibilities) apply to the urban public transport sector and to what extent. Using a sample of five European cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Milan and Stockholm) in decentralized countries as case studies, the thesis identifies three major outcomes of fiscal decentralization. First it increases the expenditure in public transport infrastructure. Second it increases the entrepreneurship of the local policy-makers. Third it generally improves the predictability of the revenues and therefore helps planning in the medium to long term. On the other hand, the research also shows that there is no increased willingness to tax at the local level therefore the stability of funding and its adequacy to the needs is not guaranteed by local fiscal autonomy. The thesis moreover suggests that a mixed system of national dedicated <b>taxation</b> and local <b>capacity</b> to incrementally adapt the tax rates is an optimal scheme for financing local public transport. Finally, in light of the case studies, the thesis provides some recommendations to Transport for London (TfL), in order to guide the ongoing debate on the necessity of increased fiscal autonomy for the local authorities in the UK to solutions that are likely to improve TfL's situation. by Giorgia Favero.
