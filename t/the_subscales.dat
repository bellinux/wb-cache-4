50|$|Another {{potential}} {{reason for}} the inconsistency in these findings is {{that the number of}} items in the original scale is insufficient. Normally, three or more “strongly loaded” items (i.e. items that carry a lot of statistical weight or importance) are needed to ensure the reliability of these factors. The 25 item CD-RISC does not always stick to these guidelines. For example, Factor 5 (spiritual influences) only has two items that support it.

50|$|When {{administered}} to a test population, women {{scored higher on}} fluidity, attitude-behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no significant gender differences in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister’s hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>subscales</b> of the EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity {{is a much more}} complicated construct than initially imagined.|$|E

50|$|The Western Aphasia Battery (Shewan & Kertesz, 1980) was {{designed}} to provide a means of evaluating the major clinical aspects of language function: content, fluency, auditory comprehension, repetition and naming plus reading, writing and calculation. In addition to the nonverbal skills of drawing, block design and praxis are evaluated and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices test is usually administered as well. The scoring provides two main totals, in addition to the subscale scores. These are the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) score and Cortical Quotient (CQ) score. AQ can essentially {{be thought of as a}} measure of language ability, whilst CQ is a more general measure of intellectual ability and includes all <b>the</b> <b>subscales.</b> Administration of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) yields a total score termed the Aphasia Quotient (AQ), which is said to reflect the severity of the spoken language deficit in aphasia.

50|$|In 2009 a {{study was}} {{conducted}} by Lotta Fernros of the Karolinska Institute into the methods used by Mullingstorp. The study measured the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in the participants {{at the beginning of}} the course. On arrival, before the course, the participants completed three questionnaires. The first was SWEDQUAL, with 61 items for self-rating of HRQOL classified in 13 areas, e.g. cognition, physical functions, sleep, pain, relations and emotions. The second was Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence with 13 items divided into three areas: comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability. The third was about work, education, experience of alternative medicine, sick listing and medication. Comparisons were made with population data from Statistics Sweden, the National Insurance Office and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Six of the thirteen subscales of HRQOL showed very low starting values, which is unusual in a group with such a high level of education. Eight of <b>the</b> <b>subscales</b> of HRQOL showed clinically significant improvements in the study group (>9%, p<0.01), namely: general health (9%), emotional well-being (negative 45% and positive 26%), cognitive functioning (24%), sleep (15%), pain (10%), role limitations due to emotional health (22%) and family functioning (16%). Physical, partner and sexual functioning were normal in both groups. The study concluded that the Meet Yourself Process can improve cognitive and emotional function, which in turn increases motivation. The process has the potential to be used as a starting point in rehabilitation for working life, for people who are forced for health reasons to cope with a readjustment crisis and establish a foundation for a new orientation.|$|E
50|$|The Collective Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) was {{developed}} by Luhtanen and Crocker as a measure to assess individuals’ social identity based on their membership in ascribed groups such as race, ethnicity, gender, and the like. The CSES {{has been one of}} the most widely used instruments in the field of psychology to assess collective group identity among racial and ethnic populations. In the initial CSES development study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques were used to examine the underlying factor structure of the proposed four-factor CSES. The preliminary prototype of the CSES consisted of 43 items. To shorten the instrument, Crocker and Luhtanen selected the 4 items with the highest factor loadings from each subscale to represent the final 16-item CSES. The actual scale is a list of statements that pertain to the person’s membership in a group or category and each is rated on a 7-point scale. The scoring is done through four subscales that are categorized as follows: 1) Items 1, 5, 9, and 13 = Membership self-esteem. 2) Items 2, 6, 10, and 14 = Private collective self-esteem. 3) Items 3, 7, 11, and 15 = Public collective self-esteem. 4) Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 = Importance to identity. First, reverse-score answers to items 2,4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 15, such that (1=7), (2=6), (3=5), (4=4), (5=3), (6=2), (7=1). Then sum the answers to the four items for each respective subscale score, and divide each by 4. Because <b>the</b> <b>subscales</b> measure distinct construct, it is strongly recommended against creating an overall or composite score for collective self-esteem.|$|E
