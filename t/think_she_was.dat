5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I was like, 'I don't know if that's me. She was like, 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E

Recognised by the missionaries as being a clever child, she was later sent for secondary education at John Forrest Senior High School in Perth, before leaving at the age of sixteen to return to Fitzroy Crossing. Oscar didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> capable of studying at tertiary level, but completed a Bachelor of Business degree in 2004 and commenced a PhD research degree in 2011 at University of Notre Dame, Australia.|$|E
25|$|After dwindling ratings again, {{the show}} made its craziest decision. All {{the victims are}} brought back alive on the {{tropical}} Island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). The fired actors (James Reynolds, Suzanne Rogers, Matthew Ashford, Alexis Thorpe, Josh Taylor, Peggy McCay, Frances Reid, Thaao Penghlis and Deidre Hall) all returned to their original roles. There was also another twist, the killer wasn't Marlena. Stefano DiMera's nephew, Andre (posing as Tony DiMera) had kidnapped them and made Marlena <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> killing off her friends and family. The storyline was incredibly controversial, and garnered the soap a lot of press.|$|E

On 13 October 1999, she boarded the train to Paris, on her way home for a visit. Her body was found the next day by a local farmer who {{discovered}} her partially-clothed and dismembered corpse, and her baggage was found strewn along the line. Before dawn, police <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pushed from the train as it travelled at about 125km/h (78mph) through the disused station at Chabenet, central France, possibly after a sexual assault.|$|E

500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard {{to do it without}} somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} two new {{characters in}} Gibson Praise, played by Jeff Gulka, and Diana Fowley, portrayed by Mimi Rogers. Kim Manners later said of Gulka, [...] "There {{was something about}} that kid's personality that really came off on screen. He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special. Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did {{with him and he}} knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X-Files". Chris Carter said that Fowley [...] "was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder's affection with Scully. Gillian Anderson said, [...] "She didn't make it easy on Scully. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{funeral was}} held at the Congregational Church on Wilshire Boulevard. Earp's pallbearers were William J. Hunsaker, (Earp's {{attorney}} in Tombstone and noted Los Angeles attorney); Jim Mitchell (Los Angeles Examiner reporter and Hollywood screenwriter); George W. Parsons (founding member of Tombstone's [...] "Committee of Vigilance"); Wilson Mizner (a friend of Wyatt's during the Klondike Gold Rush); John Clum (a good friend from his days in Tombstone, former Tombstone mayor, and editor of The Tombstone Epitaph); William S. Hart (good friend and Western actor and silent film star); and Tom Mix (friend and Western film star). Mitchell wrote Wyatt's local obituary. The newspapers reported that Tom Mix cried during his friend's service. When Josephine did not attend Wyatt's funeral, Grace Spolidora was furious. [...] "She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> that devastated when he died." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher has a contralto singing voice, {{described}} by author Nicholas E. Tawa as [...] "bold, deep, {{and with a}} spacious vibrato". Ann Powers of The New York Times called it [...] "a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting personality." [...] AllMusic's Bruce Eder wrote that the [...] "tremendous intensity and passion" [...] of Cher's vocals coupled with her [...] "ability to meld that projection with her acting skills" [...] can provide [...] "an incredibly powerful experience for the listener", despite her having a limited vocal range. Paul Simpson, in his book The Rough Guide to Cult Pop (2003), posits that [...] "Cher [...] the possessor {{of one of the}} huskiest, most distinctive voices in pop... which can work wonders with the right material directed by the right producer". He further addresses the believability of her vocal performances: [...] "she spits out the words... with such conviction you'd <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> delivering an eternal truth about the human condition".|$|E
500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for them to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an eye on her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's a funky track. Who's that for?' And we said, 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very pleased when she heard the track".|$|E
500|$|Longworth {{considers}} Streep's next release, [...] Out of Africa (1985), to {{have established}} {{her as a}} Hollywood superstar. In the film, Streep starred as the Danish writer Karen Blixen opposite Robert Redford's Denys Finch Hatton. Director Sydney Pollack was initially dubious about Streep in the role as he did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sexy enough, and had considered Jane Seymour for the part. Pollack recalls that Streep impressed him in a different way: [...] "She was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit. There was no shielding between her and me." [...] Streep and Pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in Kenya, particularly over Blixen's voice. Streep had spent much time listening to tapes of Blixen and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which Pollack thought excessive. A significant commercial and critical success, the film earned Streep another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and won as the Best Picture. Critic Stanley Kaufmann wrote, [...] "Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means her performance in Out of Africa is {{at the highest level}} of acting in film today".|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> abducted after getting home to her flat ... I {{have no idea of}} the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} sound, Lee {{described}} [...] "What You Want" [...] as [...] "very danceable" [...] {{and her own}} vocals as [...] "fun and snappy and it gives a cool dynamic [...] ". Lee stated {{that the process of}} recording the song was fun for the band as they had excess time. She said that initially the song was conceived while the band was just recording demo, but as time passed it progressed and grew into something more. She wrote a chorus for [...] "What You Want" [...] and played it on the piano. Lee revealed that she was initially embarrassed when she came up with the lyrics and the melody of the song as she thought the members of her band would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Janet Jackson due to the usage of a hook. During an interview with M Music & Musicians Lee revealed that she wouldn't have recorded the song if it had been brought to her before the recording of Evanescence as she would have thought it was [...] "stupid".|$|E
500|$|In May 1866, {{following}} a severe downturn in his financial fortunes, Samuel sold {{the rights to}} the Book of Household Management  to Ward, Lock and Tyler (later Ward Lock & Co). The writer Nancy Spain, in her biography of Isabella, reports that, given the money the company made from the Beetons' work, [...] "surely no man ever made a worse or more impractical bargain" [...] than Samuel did. In subsequent publications Ward Lock suppressed the details of the lives of the Beetons—especially the death of Isabella—in order to protect their investment by letting readers <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still alive and creating recipes—what Hughes considers to be [...] "intentional censorship". Those later editions continued to make the connection to Isabella in what Beetham considers to be a [...] "fairly ruthless marketing policy which was begun by Beeton but carried on vigorously by Ward, Lock, and Tyler". Those subsequent volumes bearing Isabella's name became less reflective of the original. Since its initial publication the Book of Household Management  has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. [...] "My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met." [...] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father {{died when he was}} 24. After his coming out of the closet to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, {{who was a member of}} the Religious Society of Friends, he said, [...] "Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore." [...] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a [...] "grandfather of the modern weekend".|$|E
