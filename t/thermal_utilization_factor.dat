Because these two fission product poisons remove neutrons from the reactor, they will affect the <b>thermal</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>factor</b> and thus the reactivity.

50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the <b>thermal</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>factor,</b> causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E

The mechanical threshers or combine harvesters with elevated capacity enable for both harvesting and threshing at once. Thus the paddy harvested all over persists with high moisture content that affects adversely in unit operations of paddy processing such as cleaning, storing, and milling.

In addition, the lightning impulse breakdown level considering <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are studied for the establishment of insulation design criteria of high voltage power equipment. The <b>utilization</b> <b>factors</b> are represented as the ratio of minimum electric field (Emin) to maximum electric filed (Emax).

Where, sphere-sphere electrode configuration require higher U 50 to breakdown it is 40 % than rod-sphere electrode configuration (30 %) and rod-rod electrode configuration (28 %), respectively. A difference in Emax values where the higher gap length provide lower Emax for sphere-sphere electrode configuration, while the higher gap length provide higher Emax for rod-rod and rod-sphere electrode configurations. Considering the effects of field <b>utilization</b> <b>factor,</b> which was based on difference electrode configurations, it was found that sphere-sphere electrode more uniformity at gap length 0. 5 cm (0. 9968) than rod-rod electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 2057) and rod-sphere electrode at gap length 1 cm (0. 1546).
