5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

25|$|Back in the Enchanted Forest, the {{characters}} attempt {{to work together}} to restore their realm. Regina struggles {{to come to terms with}} the loss of Henry, removing her heart and producing a sleeping curse for herself; though Mary Margaret and Robin Hood persuade her to move forward. Hood and Regina strike a strong friendship, unaware that they are each other's true love. She later takes back her castle, finding Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader) inside, who reveals to Regina that she is her older half-sister as she is the daughter of Cora. She explains her back story of how Cora abandoned her, sending her to Oz, and how she seeks to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> that she never had away from Regina. Neal and Belle travel to Rumplestiltskin's castle and are located to the Dark One's Vault by a candle-man named Lumiere. Neal unlocks the vault, resurrecting Rumplestiltskin but killing himself. Before he dies, Rumplestiltskin takes his body and merges it with his own. Hook departs the group to return to his pirate life, but struggles with the loss of the Jolly Roger. He is later informed by Ariel that the ship was stolen by fellow pirate Blackbeard (Charles Mesure). Following a duel, Hook seemingly kills Blackbeard and reclaims the Jolly Roger, while Ariel later discovers that her missing love Prince Eric had been kidnapped and taken to Hangman's Island. She later manages to find him and the two live happily together. In the Enchanted Forest, Zelena gets closer to Snow's unborn baby and informs her that she will get it. Eager to find a way stop Zelena, Snow and David seek help from Glinda the Good Witch, who informs them that light magic can defeat Zelena. Understanding this to be a reference to Emma, David sacrifices his heart to Snow, who reluctantly crushes it to create a new curse. Zelena appears and adds a memory spell to the curse that removes everyone's memories of the past year in the Enchanted Forest. Shortly afterwards, Snow instructs Regina to take her heart, split it in half and give half to Snow and half to David, and David awakens before the curse is fully enacted. Unbeknownst to Zelena, who gives Rumplestiltskin a memory potion to keep his memories intact, Neal temporarily removes himself from his father's body and sends the potion to Hook so that he can bring Emma back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> a day at a time.

He found it {{challenging}} to write, particularly Mulder and Scully's first scene where [...] "they have to come together on a case, yet {{they have to be}} at odds". [...] Shiban was inspired by the film The Men and realizing that the main character, who had been injured in war and lost his legs, wanted to walk more than anything. He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection [...] "just sort of fit". Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan's young son, Trevor, but Shiban was not bothered by it and felt that Rappo wanted to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> from Callahan, and the worst blow would be to kill his son.|$|E

But in that Shaw was willing to steal money from people who really needed it who really couldn't afford to lose it and willing to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> they had…yes, he's in Bernie territory, with both feet."

500|$|On Gatlif's direction, Odile Tremblay at Le Monde {{remarked that}} he had taken a heavy burden in {{directing}} a Holocaust movie along with coupling it with the [...] "poetic effervescence" [...] that the Romani are known for. He added that this can be regarded the best among his films. Michael Nordine characterised Gatlif's directorial style as passive and [...] "documentarian", such that it [...] "sometimes verges on emotional distance". [...] "What easily noticeable flourishes he adds tend to be understated", he added. Eric Hynes at TimeOut lauded Gatlif's work in making a celebration of textures and music of the Romani out of a melodramatic story. East County Magazines negative review summed that Gatlif had too much faith on his audience, [...] "expecting them to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> at face value".|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E
500|$|Tamara Coniff of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the verses of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] resemble those of Aretha Franklin's songs.

Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E

500|$|Pfefferberg, {{one of the}} Schindlerjuden, made it his life's {{mission to}} tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg {{attempted}} to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with MGM in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through. In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980. MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. [...] "I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character," [...] he said. [...] "What would drive a man like this to suddenly <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?" [...] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel. At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years. In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{track on}} the album {{comes in the form}} of another medley, this time called [...] "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" [...] / [...] "Housetop Celebration". Guerra noted that Carey adds some [...] "club bounce" [...] to [...] "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)", while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine thought that the [...] "Housetop Celebration" [...] part of the medley [...] "recycles the {{monolithic}} beat from Kurtis Blow’s instructive [...] "Christmas Rappin'." [...] "Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] is a variation of the A Charlie Brown Christmas animated musical television special. A piece of nostalgia, as described by Guerra, it also makes use of traditional religious carols. A fourth medley titled [...] "O Come All Ye Faithful" [...] / [...] "HallelujahChorus" [...] features Carey's mother, Patricia, who performs opera during the [...] "Hallelujah Chorus" [...] section. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, [...] "Here Mariah Carey is at her best as she threatens to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> too far sonically with operatic tones, impossibly high notes, and melisma in full force, but somehow it all holds together in exhilarating fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does she have to die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> so literally." ...|$|E

[...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
500|$|Orton began feuding {{with the}} McMahon {{family on the}} January 19, 2009 episode of Raw when he confronted both Mr. McMahon and Stephanie, {{claiming}} that he was worth more than her, {{and that she had}} become [...] "worthless". This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he'd terminate him on the spot. As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked him and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher. On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H. The next night on Raw, Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a [...] "loss of control" [...] because of the disorder. He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, {{due to the fact that}} he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble. Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said she had [...] "bigger plans", leading to Shane McMahon returning to Raw and attacking Orton. This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won. The next night on Raw, Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match. Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an RKO. This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton [...] "crossed the line" [...] when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife. Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution; according to Orton, Triple H [...] "ruined his life", so Orton was going to do the same and <b>take</b> <b>everything</b> that Triple H cared about away from him. He challenged Triple H for the WWE title at WrestleMania XXV, which he was unsuccessful. He won it the next month at Backlash by pinning Triple H in a special six-man tag team match between The Legacy and Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon. At Extreme Rules, he lost the title to Batista in a Steel Cage match. The following night on Raw, Orton and Legacy attacked Batista and broke his arm, forcing him to vacate the title. On the June 15 Raw, Orton regained the title in a fatal four-way match, over Triple H, John Cena and Big Show. He lost the title to John Cena in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at Breaking Point. He then regained it from Cena in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell. At Bragging Rights, Orton again lost the title to Cena in a one-hour Iron Man match.|$|E
