IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters.

[...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth.

500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just knew that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E

In addition, 67% of men now strongly {{believe that it is}} unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model. To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including ‘real’ women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, “body fascism is [...] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages”. Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer’s self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labelling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.|$|E
