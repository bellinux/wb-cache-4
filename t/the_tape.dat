5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was produced anonymously, The Observer linked <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee. The agents meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants {{to turn over}} <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> {{in exchange for their}} reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts his mother, {{who tells}} him that his father chose that Samantha be taken. At FBI headquarters, Skinner once again meets with the Smoking Man about <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> The Smoking Man calls Skinner's bluff, knowing he no longer has <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> but Skinner reveals that Albert and twenty other Navajo have memorized the {{contents}} of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and are ready to reveal it if either Mulder or Scully are harmed. Mulder meets with Scully at the hospital, who reveals that her sister died a few hours before. Mulder tells Scully that {{he believes that the}} truth is still in the X-Files. Scully {{tells him that}} she's heard the truth, and now what she wants are the answers.|$|E
50|$|After {{an initial}} refusal to comply {{on the grounds}} of {{executive}} privilege, Nixon offered to remit <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to a respected U.S. Senator, John C.

5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had <b>the</b> master <b>tapes</b> in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and intended to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to Wurpel and U2.|$|R
50|$|Logan (Jason Dohring) has <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and is {{watching}} them, crying. Afterwards, Logan burns <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Keith {{comes in and}} finds out that Logan bought <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> <b>The</b> remaining juror changes his vote, believing that the defendants will appeal and win. After, {{one of the jurors}} invites Veronica to Hearst College. Veronica finds that her car is vandalized. Leo actually stole <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> in order to pay for his sister with Down syndrome to go to a private school. Leo knowingly sent <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> to Logan. Later, Keith tells Veronica that Meg has died, but her baby daughter has survived. On New Years’ Eve, Veronica hears a knock on the door, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) appears. They spend New Years’ Eve together.|$|R
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} has been {{completed}} more than once, an alternate ending occurs, where the protagonist knocks Eric unconscious, taking <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> back instead of holding the skate-off.|$|E
5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver {{to concentrate on the}} road. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E
50|$|For years, {{the soundtrack}} was {{unavailable}} on CD, originally {{due to a}} dispute between Carlos and CBS Records. Carlos later discovered that <b>the</b> original master <b>tapes</b> had deteriorated {{to the point where}} attempting to play them could destroy both <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and <b>the</b> playback machine. Carlos used a technique called tape baking (in which <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were literally baked in an oven to harden the glue holding <b>the</b> magnetic <b>tape</b> together) to repair <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> so she could transfer them to digital masters.|$|R
2500|$|After finding [...] "the lost tapes", Bergeron {{brought them}} into Stern's {{production}} studio. He stated that <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were so old that <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> with <b>the</b> Larry Fine interviews began to shred as Stern's radio engineers ran them through their cart players. They really {{had only one}} shot, but fortunately for Stooges fans <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were saved.|$|R
40|$|YBaCuO-coated {{conductors}} offer {{great potential}} {{in terms of}} performance and cost-saving for superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). A resistive SFCL based on coated conductors {{can be made from}} several tapes connected in parallel or in series. Ideally, the current and voltage are shared uniformly by <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> when quench occurs. However, due to the non-uniformity of property of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and <b>the</b> relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> <b>the</b> currents and the voltages of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> are different. In this paper, a numerical model is developed to investigate the current and voltage sharing problem for the resistive SFCL. This model is able to simulate the dynamic response of YBCO tapes in normal and quench conditions. Firstly, four tapes with different Jc 's and n values in E-J power law are connected in parallel to carry the fault current. The model demonstrates how the currents are distributed among <b>the</b> four <b>tapes.</b> These four tapes are then connected in series to withstand the line voltage. In this case, the model investigates the voltage sharing between <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Several factors that would affect the process of quenches are discussed including the field dependency of Jc, the magnetic coupling between <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and <b>the</b> relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>tapes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The Skanska case {{occurred}} during Kirchner's presidency, during which {{several members of}} de Vido's ministry were accused of bribery in requests for tender for pipeline construction, based on a tape recording of Skanska employees discussing the bribes. The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was not acceptable evidence {{and there was no}} overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> was accepted as evidence.|$|E
