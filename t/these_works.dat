5|$|Since the 1990s, regular {{maintenance}} and minor improvements {{have been an}} ongoing effort; $3.9million was spent on <b>these</b> <b>works</b> in Western Australia in 1996.

5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has {{historically}} been characterised by murals and other artistic works in its stations, making it a kind of museum throughout the system. <b>These</b> <b>works,</b> {{and a number of}} complete stations, are considered part of the cultural heritage of the city and several of them were declared National Historic Landmarks in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The Riverina was {{the setting}} for some of Australia's great artistic and {{literary}} works of the 19th and early 20th century. Most of <b>these</b> <b>works</b> reflected the rural lifestyle and agricultural pursuits common in the Riverina {{at that time and}} projected an image of Australia and Australians that would later change rapidly.|$|E
5|$|While {{traditional}} accounts list Buddhaghosa as {{the author}} of all of <b>these</b> <b>works,</b> the current consensus among scholars accepts only the Visuddhimagga and the commentaries on the first four nikayas as Buddhaghosa's work.|$|E
5|$|Andjar's toneels were {{generally}} based on day-to-day experiences, {{rather than the}} tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar's stage plays, {{as well as those}} of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in <b>these</b> <b>works</b> to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies.|$|E

5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. <b>These</b> <b>works</b> attempted to list major world events {{from the time}} of the biblical Genesis until their present time in a universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers and Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today <b>these</b> <b>works</b> are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting <b>these</b> <b>works</b> {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E

5|$|By 1942 Pane {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} playwrights in Java, together with El Hakim (pseud. Aboe Hanifah) and Usmar Ismail. Their works often dealt with politics, a sense of nationalism, and the influence of one's environment—particularly tradition, ethics, and religion. As with Kami, Perempuan, <b>these</b> <b>works</b> were oriented around everyday events and featured average people, as opposed to the earlier stories based in mythology and telling of gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Friedrich {{frequently}} sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with {{death and the}} afterlife; he even created designs {{for some of the}} funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of <b>these</b> <b>works</b> were lost in the fire that destroyed Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age of Enlightenment, were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the corruption of its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of <b>these</b> <b>works</b> he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E

Minor sources for the period include the works of Pompeius Trogus (epitomized by Justinus), Cornelius Nepos and Ctesias of Cnidus (epitomized by Photius), which are not in their original textual form. <b>These</b> <b>works</b> are not considered reliable (especially Ctesias), and are not particularly useful for reconstructing the history of this period.|$|E
5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. <b>These</b> <b>works</b> would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tolkien was {{pursuing}} an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, {{which he had been}} creating since 1917. <b>These</b> <b>works</b> all saw posthumous publication.|$|E
