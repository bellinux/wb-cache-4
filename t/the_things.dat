5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely {{in proportion to}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that happen to him.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{anything}} that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{that are in the}} universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E

There were consequently, hierarchies of <b>things,</b> so that <b>the</b> local <b>things</b> were represented at <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> for a larger area, for a province or land. At <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> disputes were solved and political decisions were made. The place for <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> was often also the place for public religious rites and for commerce.|$|R

60|$|Since {{all known}} {{things are in}} time, a causal law must take account of {{temporal}} relations. It {{will be part of}} the causal law to state a relation of succession or coexistence between <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> given and <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> inferred. When we hear thunder and infer that there was lightning, the law states that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> inferred is earlier than <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> given. Conversely, when we see lightning and wait expectantly for the thunder, the law states that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> given is earlier than <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> inferred. When we infer a man's thoughts from his words, the law states that the two are (at least approximately) simultaneous.|$|R
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities. Specifically, their meaning is determined by <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they are about in the external world. This {{makes it difficult to}} explain how they can play the causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes.|$|E
5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{he did to}} give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there.

5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she did were <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a telegram from Brett asking for help; she had gone to Madrid with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that might have been.|$|E

5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} armour. In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and Armour, {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of armour formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the armour in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, which was one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> for which he had been campaigning.|$|E

5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life.

And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish <b>the</b> <b>things</b> her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able to}} support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

50|$|He {{concludes that}} though people can {{contemplate}} <b>the</b> same <b>thing,</b> we cannot contemplate 'the intuitive apprehension' of another. This connotes the Sartrean idea of becoming apprehensive about the awareness {{that we are}} to be responsible for our own doings, and also that we can be conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like another consciousness is conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> but we cannot reflect on their being conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like we can reflect on our being conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> In this way we are still only condemned to making ourselves as we battle with our own consciousness, and so we don’t create the world, we are objects in the world.|$|R
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up.

5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't even take aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I wish to forget".
