5|$|Access to {{improved}} sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.

The die used for the initial strikings was {{specially}} <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> produce a frosted or cameo effect, which wore down after the first approximately 75 strikings, according to Swiatek in his later volume on commemoratives. Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, and that this was done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a mint mark; this was most likely a trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock and later sold from his estate.|$|E

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E

The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E

5|$|At war's end, {{the task}} of {{bringing}} home American soldiers began almost immediately. Kroonland did her part by carrying home 26,152 passengers in eight trips. The ship departed from Brest in late November with her first load of nearly 2,000 wounded and convalescing soldiers, {{many of whom were}} from the U.S. 76th Infantry Division. The former liner arrived at the Quarantine Station on 10 December 1918, and docked in New York the next day. One of the men aboard was Captain Walter Camp who had been wounded and gassed in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive; Camp was the son of the Yale University football coach of the same name. Another passenger on board was Sarah Wilmer, an American YWCA front-line worker who had become lost in the Argonne forest and gassed when a German shell exploded nearby. Before departing on her next voyage, Kroonland hosted a party for 150 newsboys from New Jersey at her Hoboken, New Jersey, pier on Christmas Day. With a Christmas tree in the troops' mess, the newsboys were <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> a dinner and entertainment by the ship's band, and all received presents.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, but the food on the project was prized by many workers. As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road.|$|E
50|$|Other {{medications}} are occasionally used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{side effects}} or prevent complications. They include antihypertensives <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> high blood pressure; ephedrine or phenylephrine <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> low blood pressure; salbutamol <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> asthma, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm; and epinephrine or diphenhydramine <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> allergic reactions.

5|$|Lehman {{played with}} the Millionaires until the 1925–26 season. During that time, Lehman {{and some of his}} {{teammates}} were involved in a humorous incident when going back to Canada after an exhibition game against the Montreal Wanderers in New York City. In New York, Lehman's wife bought numerous women's designer outfits, after being <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> a shopping spree by him. When going back to Canada, Lehman, on the advice of Cyclone Taylor, who was both a professional ice hockey player and a Canadian immigration officer, split up all outfits among his teammates to avoid paying additional taxes {{he would have had to}} pay if he had brought all the clothing by himself at once; this puzzled the Customs officers. In 1922–23, the Millionaires were renamed the Maroons, and joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The WCHL was renamed to the Western Hockey League in 1925–26; however, the league disbanded at the conclusion of that season. While playing for the Millionaires, Lehman appeared in six Stanley Cup finals, losing every time, except in his first season, in 1914–15.|$|E
5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Palsgraf {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the legal world quickly. Dean William L. Prosser of the University of California Law School wrote that the Appellate Division's decision fell into the hands of Professor Francis H. Bohlen of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Bohlen was at that time the Reporter compiling the first Restatement of Torts for the American Law Institute (ALI), and Cardozo was informally one of the advisers. In that task, Bohlen was having difficulty dealing with the concept of duty of care in negligence, especially involving unforeseeable plaintiffs, and Prosser related that Cardozo was <b>treated</b> <b>to</b> a learned discussion by the other advisers of a case that might come before his court and, convinced by the arguments, used them to decide Palsgraf. Kaufman doubted this story, which was told to Prosser by Dean Young B. Smith of Columbia, noting that the only meeting of the advisers between the two appeal decisions in Palsgraf took place in New York on December 12–13, 1927, beginning only three days after the Appellate Division ruled, and the notes reveal that Cardozo was absent; the chief judge was hearing arguments all that week in Albany. Nevertheless, the discussions and materials from the Restatement compilation likely influenced Cardozo in his decision.|$|E
