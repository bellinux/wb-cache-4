25|$|In 1970, {{the journey}} took 75 hours. With {{subsequent}} infrastructure improvements and reductions {{to the time}} needed <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> and crew, the journey now takes 65 hours despite the longer distance.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{numerous}} underlying cross-border {{problems are}} {{at the root of}} the difficulties of regional rail transport. A lack of track-sharing agreements means that a single operator moving goods through two or more countries is not feasible. This causes time-consuming and costly border operations - trains have <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> and crews at each border crossing. There is no system of sealing wagons to avoid the need for customs inspections at borders or within transit countries.|$|E
25|$|Because {{only one}} major line (the Gippsland line) had been electrified, the {{economic}} advantages of electric traction were not fully realised {{due to the}} need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> for trains that extended beyond {{the range of the}} electrified network, which added to the overall cost per mile. Furthermore, the additional expense associated with maintaining the 1,500 V DC overhead catenary system saw V/Line move to withdraw the L class from service and dewire the Gippsland line beyond Pakenham. The L class fleet were withdrawn from service by 1987.|$|E
50|$|With federation, customs roles {{finished}} in January 1901 although trains would continue <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>locomotives</b> until the 1980s. On 7 September 1951, the westbound Overland service collided with its eastbound equivalent {{at the station}} with four A2 class locomotives destroyed and one fatality.|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} driven between Budapest and Prague by ZSSK’s ŽSSK 350 (nicknamed Gorilla) 25 kV AC/3 kV DC {{locomotive}}. In this way {{there is no}} need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the Hungarian-Slovak or at the Czech-Slovak border. Between Prague and Dresden there is a ČSD 371 high speed 15 kV AC/3 kV DC locomotive {{at the front of the}} train. For last part of the route, between Dresden and Berlin there is usually a DB 101 high speed 15 kV AC locomotive in use.|$|R
50|$|Following a sharp {{increase}} in freight traffic through the Brenner Pass (largely on road), the railway is currently considered to have insufficient capacity. Moreover, its steep grades, tight radius bends and the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotive</b> engines at Brenner due to two different electrical systems as used in Austria and Italy mean that the average travel speed is low. For these reasons, {{the creation of a new}} line is planned from Verona to Munich via Innsbruck. At the heart of this project lies a 55 kilometre-long tunnel between Franzensfeste and Innsbruck, known as the Brenner Base Tunnel.|$|R
25|$|In both states, {{the use of}} {{electric}} locomotives on principal interurban routes {{proved to be a}} qualified success. In Victoria, because only one major line (the Gippsland line) had been electrified, the economic advantages {{of electric}} traction were not fully realised due to the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> for trains that ran beyond the electrified network. VR's electric locomotive fleet was withdrawn from service by 1987 and the Gippsland line electrification was dismantled by 2004. The 86 class locomotives introduced to NSW in 1983 had a relatively short life as the costs of changing locomotives at the extremities of the electrified network, together with the higher charges levied for electricity use, saw diesel-electric locomotives make inroads into the electrified network. Electric power car trains are still used for urban passenger services.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{provides}} {{service to}} and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its Keystone and Pennsylvanian services between New York, Philadelphia, and the Harrisburg Transportation Center daily. The Pennsylvanian route, which operates once daily, continues west to Pittsburgh. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Philadelphia 30th Street Station; most of these trains also travel {{to and from}} New York Penn Station. The Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously welded rail, and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> at 30th Street Station (from diesel to electric and vice versa) for trains continuing to or coming from New York. As of Federal Fiscal Year 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.|$|E

50|$|One notable <b>change</b> <b>to</b> the <b>locomotive</b> was {{the larger}} water tank on the {{extended}} frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{line can}} be divided into two sections, both {{originally}} rope-worked. The lower section serving New Stubbin Colliery, sunk between 1913 and 1915, <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>locomotive</b> working.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{operating}} of {{the line}} was divided between ČSD and Polish State Railways (PKP). There are corridor rails {{between the two countries}} which connect Krnov-Jesenik with the Polish territories. As all trains had to stop in Głuchołazy <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its <b>locomotive.</b> And there was no passenger traffic here up to 2006.|$|R
50|$|The ICE from Amsterdam to Cologne, Frankfurt/Main and Basel all {{pass through}} the station without stopping. However the CityNightLine {{services}} stop here, even though {{not all of them}} have <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|E
50|$|Swindon {{railway station}} was opened in 1842 and until 1895 every passing train stopped here {{for at least}} 10 minutes <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives.</b> As such Swindon station hosted the first {{recorded}} Railway refreshment rooms.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 {{work began}} on electrifying the line as a {{continuation}} of the electrification of the Lübeck-Hamburg railway. The electrification was completed in December 2008. Freight trains since then have been able to operate without having <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the Hamburg area.|$|E
50|$|Vorë is an {{important}} transport hub for Central Albania. It lies {{in the middle of}} the long range of hills known as the Kodra e Gjatë which separates the Plain of Tirana from the plains running along the Erzen and surrounding Durrës to the west. Vorë is located in a pass, not more than 60 metres high, which cuts through the Kodra e Gjatë range. Railways, motorways, country roads, overhead power lines are all routed through this pass. Previously there was a canal as well. The roads from Durrës and the railways run by Hekurudha Shqiptare go on from Vorë through Fushë-Krujë to the northern part of the country and onwards to Tirana in the east. Trains from Tirana to Shkodër have <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the Vorë station.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> various <b>locomotives</b> {{over their}} long lives were Belpaire fireboxes, {{enlarged}} coal bunkers, and even superheaters. One or two were fitted with spark-arresting chimneys. 21 were fitted for working autotrains.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War I, Maine Central began retracting. It sold or {{abandoned}} lines {{such as the}} narrow gauge and logging branches, {{as well as its}} hotels, ferries and steamships. [...] In the 1930s it began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its <b>locomotives</b> from steam-powered to diesel-powered. Beginning in 1933, Maine Central entered into a [...] "joint management" [...] agreement with the Boston and Maine Railroad, with which it shared the Portland Terminal Company (a switching railroad in Portland).|$|R
50|$|Generous {{provision}} {{was made for}} the maintenance of locomotives at Brandon with a six road engine house being provided although once the ECR took over the NR in 1848 the shed's role was diminished as there was no longer a requirement <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> there as they worked through to or from Norwich.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after {{entering}} service {{they were used}} to haul the [...] "Witblitz" [...] shipping container express train all the way between Johannesburg and Cape Town. This saved time by avoiding the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> at Beaufort West and Kimberley to negotiate the 25 kV AC section between these two centres, since it could be traversed in diesel-only mode even though the units are less powerful in that mode.|$|E
50|$|The Class 21E {{was placed}} in service on the 25 kV AC Coalink line between Ermelo and the Richards Bay Coal Terminal. They work {{directly}} from the coal mines around Ermelo, running under 3 kV DC catenary. The dual voltage Class 21E locomotives can therefore haul their loads directly from the mines {{all the way to}} Richards Bay without having <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> in Ermelo to cater for the change in the power supply.|$|E
50|$|Deutsche Bundesbahn {{transferred}} the station after the Second World War to the Bundesbahndirektion Mainz (railway division of Mainz), {{along with all}} railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1971, the station returned to the jurisdiction of its Karlsruhe counterpart during {{the dissolution of the}} railway division of Mainz. The electrification of the line from Karlsruhe to Wörth followed in 1974, {{in order to avoid the}} need for freight trains from the east having <b>to</b> <b>change</b> of <b>locomotives</b> in Karlsruhe.|$|R
50|$|Konosha is a {{major railway}} hub. It {{is located on the}} railway line between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (built in the south-north direction), and in Konosha, the line to Kotlas which {{eventually}} continues to Vorkuta branches off to the east. The line from Moscow to Arkhangelsk uses the alternating current, whereas the stretch to Vorkuta does not have electrification, therefore all trains from Moscow in the direction of Vorkuta have <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the <b>locomotive</b> and stop in Konosha for about twenty minutes.|$|R
50|$|Bodies {{were then}} transported by road to Broadmeadow for rebuilding. There are several major <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> the <b>locomotives.</b> These include now using AC {{traction}} motors, distributed power locotrol system instead of Locotrol II, increased weight and increased traction effort.|$|R

50|$|Between the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported {{raw silk}} cocoons from Vancouver (where {{they had been}} shipped from the Orient) to silk mills in New York and New Jersey. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, and had its own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and {{minimize}} insurance costs, the silk trains traveled quickly and stopped only <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> and crews (often done in under five minutes). The silk trains had right-of-way over all other trains; even passenger trains would {{be put in a}} siding to make the silk trains' trip faster.|$|E
50|$|Around 1935, the {{question}} of purchasing diesel locomotives for the South African Railways (SAR) was seriously considered. Even though South Africa was a coal-rich country with, at the time, the lowest pit-head prices {{in the world and}} no oil wells, there were definite advantages in favour of the diesel-electric locomotive. It did not need to take water en route, could undertake very long runs without the need <b>to</b> refuel or <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> and had a much higher rate of availability.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, {{the stock}} {{provided}} <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>locomotives</b> fitted for Blue Star multiple working. Initially {{a mixture of}} Class 25, Class 27 and Class 37 {{at each end of}} a rake of Mark 2 carriages through wired and piped to provide 90 mi/h km/h [...] "push-pull" [...] working. This very quickly settled down to a dedicated pool of Class 27 locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} SD50s have been rebuilt into the {{equivalent}} of SD40-2s. The Dash 2 features are already contained within the SD50. The units are re-rated from [...] at 950 rpm to [...] at 900 rpm. This is actually a quite simple <b>change</b> <b>to</b> the <b>locomotive's</b> Woodward PGE engine governor.|$|R
50|$|Swindon {{railway station}} opened in 1842 with {{construction}} of the Great Western Railway's engineering works continuing. Until 1895, every train stopped here for at least 10 minutes <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives.</b> Swindon station hosted the first recorded railway refreshment rooms, divided according to class. Swindonians, for a time, were eminently proud that even the current King and Queen of the time had partaken of refreshments there. The station in 1842 was built of three storeys, with the refreshment rooms on the ground floor, the upper floors comprising the station hotel and lounge. Until 1961, when Swindon Town station closed, the station was known as Swindon Junction.|$|E

To avoid train robberies and so {{minimize}} insurance costs, they travelled quickly and stopped only <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>locomotives</b> and crews, which was often done in under five minutes. The silk trains had superior rights over all other trains; even passenger trains (including the Royal Train of 1939) would be put in sidings to make the silk trains' trip faster. At the end of World War II, the invention of nylon made silk less valuable so the silk trains died out.|$|E

50|$|At Brenner station, {{located on}} the Brenner Pass (1371 metres), there is a {{monument}} to the designer, Karl von Etzel. This station is situated at the border between Italy and Austria and also the operational border between the ÖBB and FS networks. The two companies operate different electrical systems, (15,000 V AC at 16.7 Hz in Austria, and 3,000 V DC in Italy), which requires a stop <b>to</b> <b>change</b> electric <b>locomotives.</b> For this reason, for a long time the operation of express trains from Munich to Verona and Milan was carried out with diesel railcars. Until 30 May 1965 was also needed a second engine change in Bolzano station, as the Bolzano-Brenner section still operated under three-phase AC electrification.|$|R
50|$|Harry Pollitt was {{appointed}} Locomotive Engineer of the MSLR from January 1894, replacing Thomas Parker, who resigned {{at the end}} of 1893. Pollitt had previously been Works Manager at the Gorton locomotive works of the MSLR, under Parker. In June 1894, his duties were expanded to cover the MSLR's fleet of ferries on the Humber, and his job title was <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Locomotive</b> & Marine Engineer. On 1 August 1897, the MSLR was renamed the Great Central Railway (GCR).|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} the {{introduction}} of multicurrent rolling stock, which can be run on both the Austrian and Italian networks, has made it possible, at least in principle, <b>to</b> avoid <b>locomotive</b> <b>changes.</b> However, the need for locomotives to carry equipment for different signalling systems and to have safety approvals for different networks and lines, {{and the need for}} staff to know operating rules and routes has limited multicurrent operations in practice.|$|R
