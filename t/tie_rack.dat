50|$|A rack is a toothed bar or rod {{that can}} be thought of as a sector gear with an {{infinitely}} large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a pinion: the pinion turns; the rack moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the <b>tie</b> rod(s). <b>Racks</b> also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|R

25|$|Price lining {{is the use}} of {{a limited}} number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a {{tradition}} started in the old five and dime stores in which everything cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate <b>racks</b> of men's <b>ties,</b> where each <b>rack</b> is priced at $10, $20 and $40.|$|R
40|$|Tie rods or Track rods are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system. Just as its name suggests a Tie rod <b>ties</b> vehicle’s steering <b>rack</b> to the steering arm. Tie rod may get fail due to varying forces and bumping of vehicle during steering. The forces from the steering are also considered during the static condition of car. Vibration and buckling of Tie rod has been continuously a concern which may lead to structural failure if the resulting vibration and stresses are undesirable and excessive. So research work is aimed to assess buckling strength and compare buckling performance of Tie rod for different materials. Finite element models of the Tie rod also analyzed to obtain stiffness and stress distributions in each component. Based on the experimental test results, theoretical calculation results and finite element analysis with NASTRAN results, stiffness values are validated. The mode shape and natural frequency results for different materials obtained in the normal modal analysis are compared. In buckling analysis, the load factor obtained for different materials were compared and critical buckling load is calculated and is validated by theoretical calculations...|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in January 1964. After the events {{described}} in The China Doll, six AXE agents based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, have been found mutilated and murdered in a short space of time. Nick Carter (undercover as shady millionaire businessman Robert Milbank) accompanied by fellow agent Rosalind Adler (posing as Milbank’s mistress, Rosita Montez) are sent to investigate. Carter (as Milbank) uses his apparent wealth and influence to enter the higher social circles in Rio de Janeiro and quickly meets socialite Carla Langley - wife {{of one of the}} missing agents. Next, posing as American journalist, Michael Nolan, Carter interviews the wife of Joao de Santos, a local investigative reporter, and another of the missing agents. Meanwhile, Agent Adler investigates the background of missing agent Carlos Brenha, assistant curator at a local museum. As a result of their probing, a seedy nightclub quickly becomes the focus of attention. In the club’s basement, Carter discovers a cache of illegal weapons imported from China. Carter is knocked out and imprisoned in the club basement. The ringleader is revealed to be Carla Langley who is working for communist China to import illegal arms and execute minor spies in the hope that a special agent (i.e. Carter) would be sent to investigate and whom they intend to torture and kill to extract valuable information. Carter is <b>tied</b> to a <b>rack</b> and beaten but manages to escape. Rosalind Adler arrives {{in the nick of time}} and overpowers the guards with a non-lethal gas bomb (nicknamed Pepito). Carter executes the club owner and second-in-command (Luis Silveiro) and is about to do the same to Carla Langley when he discovers the gas bomb has rendered her an insane, gibbering wreck. He leaves her screaming in the night.|$|R
