5|$|In early 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Workshop</b> {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children. It demonstrated that little was being done to address the fears and concerns of victims of traumatic events.

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. <b>The</b> <b>Workshop</b> also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Workshop</b> expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by <b>the</b> <b>Workshop</b> concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

5|$|The three sheds {{surrounding}} the lighthouse are <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> to the south, the former powerhouse {{to the west}} and the fuel store to the north.

It consists of two rooms with pivoting sash windows and timber framed doors and no internal lining. The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double timber framed doors.|$|E

5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She and Bradley selected <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City Ballet declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>workshop,</b> she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E
5|$|Finally, after <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> concluded, an 1884 {{edition of}} the Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This {{publication}} used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1990s the {{laboratory}} was rededicated to medical and urban entomology, with Professor John Edman running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron Prokopy focusing on orchard pest control.

50|$|Recent years saw use of <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> for a {{very limited}} period of time - narrow gauge access to <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> from <b>the</b> main railway line was re-instated in mid-2004, and {{effectively}} ceased in late 2007.

50|$|In June 1992, {{organizers}} of the program formed a core focus group, developing advertisements and short articles {{in order to promote}} participation of <b>the</b> <b>workshops.</b> <b>The</b> three <b>workshops</b> were held in September and November 1992 and February 1993 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>workshops</b> consisted of a panel of transgender people living with HIV/AIDS and the focus of <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> was <b>the</b> impact of HIV/AIDS and what could be done in order {{to prevent the spread of}} the virus. Specifically, organizers had a focus on eroticizing safer sex and risk reduction strategies relating to the use of needles when injecting hormones and/or silicone. There were a total of 126 registrants of the program. Out of these 126 registrants, 86 participated in <b>the</b> <b>workshops.</b> 74 of these 86 participants participated in the study.|$|R
5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel.

In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as {{commander of the}} artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform leadership roles normally the preserve of officers.

5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs.

A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E
