500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{admitted}} {{his team}} had underachieved during the season, but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United {{in the league and}} progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a [...] "compliment to the club". He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion, because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs: [...] "In England a team <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship, especially if they play in the Champions League. There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup." [...] When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help, Wenger commented it [...] "...would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income. As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining." ...|$|E

500|$|As with 1989's album Like a Prayer, Madonna's {{hair was}} dyed dark brown to signify [...] "seriousness", {{and on the}} cover of the album Madonna wore a beret while resurrecting the famous Guerrillero Heroico image of Guevara. In an {{interview}} with Veja magazine, she described Guevara as [...] "an icon instantaneously identified with an revolution spirit. <b>That</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> the whole album: the current moment, I feel a revolutionary state of mind". Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández wrote in his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations, that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work. Because of the paramilitary theme, the dyed hair and the artistic composition, was compared with an infamous seventies photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress, Patty Hearst. The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering. The word [...] "American Life" [...] is written in blood red color and has a punk-rock style. Inside the CD booklet, she wielded an Uzi submachine gun, her body in various martial art poses, spelling out her name. By late 2003, she had wiped out the military image completely, and followed with another subtle toned-down image of that of a writer and philanthropist.|$|E

But Minnesota intercepted Harmon's pass in the end zone, and Michigan lost by one point. Harmon had also missed a point after touchdown kick earlier in the game. Despite the loss, one columnist said of Frutig's performance against Minnesota: “The best end I saw all year I saw in this game. That was Frutig of Michigan and <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> offense and defense. He ruined about six coming in there trying to block those Gopher punts. He did block one.” ...|$|E

We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, we all should have been one not separate. <b>That</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans.

They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly.
