5|$|Recent {{research}} on the Wirral has identified a possible landing site for the Norse and Scots. This is a feature called Wallasey Pool. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of the Wirral near the River Mersey. The pool {{is linked to the}} river by a creek which, before it was developed into modern docks, stretched inland some two miles, was, at high tide over 20 feet deep and was surrounded by a moss or mere which is now known as Bidston Moss. In addition to this landing site a Roman Road leads from the area of Bidston to Chester. Following the route of this road would take an invading force through the area the battle {{is believed to have been}} fought. Landscape survey has identified a likely position for Bruna's burh. This survey places the burh at Brimstage approximately 11 miles from Chester.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. Inlaid coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with inlaid coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E

25|$|Vigabatrin is {{also used}} to treat {{seizures}} in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause is}} not clearly understood, but {{is thought to}} be caused by a defect in embryologic development. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first twelve weeks of pregnancy.

Thus causing the melanocytes to form in clusters instead of spread out, causing abnormal skin pigmentation in some areas of the body.|$|E

25|$|By comparison, {{the most}} {{efficient}} randomized primality test for general integers, the Miller–Rabin primality test, requires O(k n2 log n log log n) bit operations using FFT multiplication for an n-digit number, where k {{is the number of}} iterations and is related to the error rate. For constant k, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same complexity class as the Lucas-Lehmer test. In practice however, the cost of doing many iterations and other differences leads to worse performance for Miller–Rabin. The most efficient deterministic primality test for any n-digit number, the AKS primality test, requires Õ(n6) bit operations in its best known variant and is dramatically slower in practice.|$|E

25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

However, as of 2017, it continues to remain a focus of central government bureaucracy, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of fully moving to Dodoma. In addition, it is Tanzania's most prominent city in arts, fashion, media, music, film and television and a leading financial centre, with the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) being the country's first and most important stock exchange market. The city is the leading arrival and departure point for most tourists who visit Tanzania, including the national parks for safaris and the islands of Unguja and Pemba. Dar es Salaam is also the largest and most populous Swahili-speaking city in the world.|$|E

25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players {{to be able to}} find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.|$|E
