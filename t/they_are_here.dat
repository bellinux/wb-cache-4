These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the fruit doves and pigeons (including the Nicobar pigeon). Therefore, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> included as a subfamily Raphinae, pending better material evidence of their exact relationships.|$|E

Due to their chief purpose as a neutral presence here, they are not allowed to marry Singaporean women, hence the allowance to bring their wives and children from Nepal to the camp. At the end of their contract, they are expected to return to their villages and back to a rural life dependent on agriculture. Only a handful have ever been known to have broken this tradition and chosen to stay in the city-state.|$|E

Parry, the expedition's leader, explains that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to find {{the remains of the}} Cybermen, who apparently died out five centuries before. The expedition is funded by Kaftan, who is accompanied by her manservant Toberman and her colleague Klieg. One of the men is electrocuted opening the doors, but the group manages to enter the chamber. They find a control panel and a large, sealed hatch. Parry and Klieg try to open it as Toberman leaves.|$|E

The {{remaining}} 200 South African policemen transferred {{to help in}} the guerilla war were removed suddenly in August 1975, a move which appeared to precede even more disengagement.

She visits him later and asks Jack to treat Ben's back, which has become {{infected}} following the surgery, but Jack refuses. She also explains that she is {{in trouble with the}} Others for killing Pickett. Later, Isabel (Diana Scarwid), the Others' [...] "sheriff," [...] arrives at the cage and discusses Jack's tattoo with him, as she can read the Chinese. Isabel brings him to a room where Juliet is being held and asks him whether Juliet told him to kill Ben or not. Jack lies and says she did not and is brought back to his cage. Once back, he is visited by Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) and the previously kidnapped members of the tail-section. Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at the base of her spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together. At the end of the episode, Jack and the Others travel back to the main island on a boat. Just before leaving, Isabel translates Jack's tattoo, [...] "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us". Jack replies, [...] "That's what they say, that's not what they mean." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review: [...] "Unafraid {{to drop a}} line like [...] "My name's Shaniqua and what?", {{it was only a}} matter of time before N-Dubz turned their large underground following into mainstream success. Now, having shifted over 500,000 copies of debut disc Uncle B and reached No.1 alongside Tinchy Stryder, the Camden trio are aiming to become leaders of the Brrap pack with second album Against All Odds. Reflecting their move up pop's pecking order, this trailer single is their biggest, most bombastic moment yet. It's got hawkish sirens and loads of clubby synths - evidently inspired by Fraser T Smith's production on the Tinchy album - but N-Dubz haven't lost their usual quirky charm, dropping in oh-so-relevant references to Facebook and LBDs (that's [...] "little black dress", fellas). With an appeal that extends far beyond the back of the bus, 'I Need You' is – to borrow a word from the inimitable Dappy - probably best described as a [...] "smasher"." [...] Sarah-Louise James of the Daily Star reviewed the single as: [...] "British hip-house at its fizziest." [...] Alt-Uk.net reviewed the track: [...] "I Need You is an absolute fun-packed single from N-Dubz, and whilst listening to this one it really is difficult not to start singing along. N-Dubz once again demonstrates here a great knack for penning a perfect pop song, and this group certainly seems to know what it's doing when it comes to making the music as infectious as possible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog also positively reviewed the song, mentioning: [...] "It's this kind of bonkers happenstance which I love. I basically do internal bogglejumps whenever they do something like that. Pop songs are so safe, and N-Dubz seem to wander over the lines of acceptable behaviour almost as if they don't realise they are there." [...] The Chemistry Is Dead described the single as being [...] "much more mainstream" [...] as well as something that would [...] "appeal to their old fans and new fans alike." [...] Inside Gossip labelled [...] "I Need You" [...] as a [...] "club banger that has set the standards and told the world that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> and that they are not one hit wonders." ...|$|E
