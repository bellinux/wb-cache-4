The Tribunal’s finding that Mr Muschett had never been an employee was unimpeachable. The question was whether under RRA 1976 section 78 there could be found a contract ‘personally to execute any work or labour’. As the EAT had found, because Mr Muschett was {{under no obligation to}} the Prison Service and could terminate the engagement at any time by giving the agency notice, Mr Muschett was merely a <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>worker.</b> Implying a contract of employment was not necessary.

50|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft <b>Temporary</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>Worker</b> Directive (COD 2002/0149). This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6-week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City have been calling for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12-week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86; Germany has this for all workers already, regardless of their agency status, §622 BGB).|$|E

40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> {{are often}} portrayed as {{peripheral}} workers in organisations. Hence, they present a compelling {{illustration of the}} established-outsider theory of Elias and Scotson. According to this theory, differences in social cohesion, group charisma, {{and power of the}} members of subgroups within social entities can lead to an established-outsider figuration between these subgroups, which is maintained by processes of stigmatisation and exclusion. Applying a narrative approach, we focus on social relations between <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> and permanent <b>workers</b> along three routes. First, we show how and why social cohesion, group charisma, and power possession in the established group of permanent workers shape an established-outsider figuration.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the legal {{regulation}} regarding the psychosocial work environment for temporary agency workers. Furthermore, the aim of the study is to examine how temporary agency workers perceive their psychosocial work environment, and possible consequences of such perception. The methodology of the study consists of practical legal method and qualitative method in the form of interviews. The results show that the psychosocial work environment for temporary agency workers is regulated at both the EU legal level by Directive as well as at national level in Arbetsmiljölagen and regulations issued by Arbetsmiljöverket. The study finds that health and safety responsibility for temporary agency workers is shared between the agency and the client company. The result of the study indicates that there are shortcomings in the introduction and training of temporary agency workers, which can contribute to an unsatisfactory work environment. Furthermore, the study shows that temporary agency workers have satisfying relationships with the manager of the client company that enables the <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>worker</b> to obtain social support.

40|$|The {{vulnerable}} {{situation of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> is manifested {{in previous research}} that evidences the job insecurity of this group.

In Sweden, where <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> have the same type of employment contracts (i. e., temporary or permanent contracts) and are entitled to the same employment protection as other groups of employees, one might expect a different picture. This article examines the situation of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> who have the same working conditions as client organization employees. These workers have permanent contracts and are treated like client organization employees. We have chosen to examine this case because we anticipate it to be very likely to contradict statements regarding <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ affiliation with the precariat. This article aims to empirically elucidate the precariousness of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> who are highly integrated with client organization employees and who share the same work tasks. Our analysis shows that competence development is crucial to perceptions of job security. However, <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> lack competence development, both {{on the part of the}} employer (the <b>temporary</b> work <b>agency)</b> and on the part of the client organization.

40|$|Purpose: Temporary agency working {{continues}} {{to grow in the}} UK. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to look at a number of important developments in the agency industry, which generate implications for the performance of agencies, temps and the user firms in which temps work and to set out some of the key performance implications of these developments. These developments are: the increasingly complex set of contractual arrangements between agencies and user firms; the changing regulatory environment; and the changing role of agencies in pay setting. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the state of the art literature on agency working, and draws on 15 years of primary research and secondary analysis of the sector by the authors. Findings: The paper shows that there is a proliferation of models of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>worker</b> supply, some of which involves agencies playing a greater role within firms in the management of temps, with other involving a deliberate and strategic distancing of client firms and/or agency in the day-to-day management of temps. This creates significant challenges for the management of temps. The paper also finds that there are significant tensions and challenges arising from the implementation of the Agency Working Regulations, even though these regulations have the potential to raise motivation and performance of temps. Practical implications: The management of temps creates significant challenges for organisations and agencies. New models of supply of agency labour have the potential to make these challenges even more problematic, if not addressed effectively. The implications of the shifting regulatory and political environment also need closer scrutiny, particularly in the context of the recent EU referendum result in the UK. Originality/value: The paper sheds light on a number of new developments in the agency sector, and by demonstrating their effects on organisations, agencies and temps, draws out some of the performance implications of the continued and changing use of agency temps...|$|E

Methods A cohort of 1077 sick-listed workers without an employment contract were included at baseline, i. e. 13 weeks after reporting sick. Demographic variables were available at baseline. Measurement of cross-sectional data took place 4 – 6 months after inclusion. Primary outcome measures were: frequency of OHC interventions and RTW-rates. Measured confounding variables were: gender, age, type of worker (<b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>worker,</b> unemployed worker, or remaining worker without employment contract), level of education, reason for absenteeism (diagnosis), and perceived health. The association between OHC interventions and RTW was analysed with a logistic multiple regression analysis. Results At 7 – 9 months after the first day of reporting sick only 19 % of the workers had (partially or completely) returned to work, and most workers perceived their health as fairly poor or poor.

Semi-structured interviews with five IPs were then held to evaluate the IPs' field experience using the MPP guidance document, in terms of (a) feasibility and (b) perceived usefulness of the MPP guidance document. The main adaptation introduced in the guideline is that interaction with the workplace, which is absent in this population, needed to be established in an alternative way, i. e., through the involvement of vocational rehabilitation agencies and labour experts. Overall, the guideline required minimal changes. In total, nineteen sick-listed workers were counselled using the MPP guidance document. The overall experience of the IPs was that the MPP guidance document was feasible and useful for the IP, while they had mixed responses on its usefulness for the sick-listed worker, in part due to the follow-up period of this study.

The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the adaptations needed in the practice guideline for employed workers to enable its use by insurance physicians (IPs) for counselling of sick-listed unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with minor psychological problems; and (2) evaluate the experiences of IPs when using the new guidance document for minor psychological problems (MPP guidance document). Methods The MPP guidance document for unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> was developed through discussions with nine IPs and with the help of an expert. Semi-structured interviews with five IPs were then held to evaluate the IPs’ field experience using the MPP guidance document, in terms of (a) feasibility and (b) perceived usefulness of the MPP guidance document. Results The main adaptation introduced in the guideline is that interaction with the workplace, which is absent in this population, needed to be established in an alternative way, i. e., through the involvement of vocational rehabilitation agencies and labour experts. Overall, the guideline required minimal changes. In total, nineteen sick-listed workers were counselled using the MPP guidance document. The overall experience of the IPs was that the MPP guidance document was feasible and useful for the IP, while they had mixed responses on its usefulness for the sick-listed worker, in part due to the follow-up period of this study. Conclusions An existing practice guideline for employed workers was adapted for use as a guidance document for unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with minor psychological problems. IPs were positive about applying the MPP guidance document. The guidance document provides opportunities for RTW counselling for unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with minor psychological problems. </p...|$|R

We select three groups – <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers,</b> workers who were unemployed before starting a new job, and unskilled workers – to determine whether trends for them differ from the overall trends assessed previously.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Among {{the working}} population, {{unemployed}} and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> are a particularly vulnerable group, {{at risk for}} sickness absence due to psychological problems. Knowledge of prognostic factors for work participation could help identify sick-listed workers with a high-risk for work disability and provide input for sickness absence counseling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify prognostic factors for the work participation of medium- and long-term sick-listed unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with psychological problems. Methods A cohort of 932 sick-listed unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with psychological problems was followed for one and a half years. Data collection was conducted at three time-frames: 10 months, 18 months and 27 months after reporting sick. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Perceived health, full return-to-work (RTW) expectations, age and work status at 18 months were strong prognostic factors for work participation at subsequent time-frames in the univariate analyses. Multiple logistic regression revealed that full RTW expectation was a prognostic factor for future work participation in both the medium- and long-term, whereas moderate-to-good perceived health was a prognostic factor for work participation in the medium-term. Being under 45 years of age and having a positive work status at 18 months were prognostic factors for work participation in the long-term. Conclusions Workers' self-appraisal of health, age and work status were strong prognostic factors for the future work participation of sick-listed unemployed and <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> with psychological problems. These findings could help occupational and insurance physicians identify high-risk sick-listed workers for sickness absence counselin...|$|R
30|$|This article {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis on working conditions of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers.</b> By using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) {{the question will}} be answered, how precarious <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employment really is. For this purpose seven dimensions will be defined and operationalised with subjective and objective items from the surveys in the years 2006 and 2007. A Propensity Score Matching approach will be deployed to form a valid control group for the <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers.</b> The evaluation of working conditions in <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employment is a two-stage procedure. First, {{the results of the}} empirical analysis will be assessed from a comparative analytical perspective. This is to investigate whether temporary workers are disadvantaged in comparison to control subjects. Then, the question of whether <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> employment is precarious will be addressed by testing by means of objective criteria.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> work in Germany {{has implications}} for {{the nature of the}} employment relationship. The notion of a clearly defined employeremployee relationship becomes difficult to uphold in triangular relationships like in the case of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> work where the agencies employees are working {{at the site of the}} client company. The blurring of the boundaries of organisations and of the employment relationship leads to ambiguities that affect Human Resource Management. Given the dominance of new institutional economic approaches in the analysis of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> work, it is not surprising that the ambiguities and the effects and consequences of the use of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> on the Human Resource Management of client companies have been underestimated and not been explored in detail. This paper wants to close that gap by adding a Human Resource Management perspective to the current debate in order to gain insight on the role of Human Resource Management in triangular relationships. By building on theoretical discussions and empirical studies the implications of the use of <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> for the Human Resource Management of client companies are analyzed with a special regard to commitment and identification with the client company. Different suggestions how to organize Human Resource Management instruments for <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> are presented to illustrate the value of a diverse Human Resource Management for different groups of the workforce...|$|R

40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> {{have become}} a global trend in the {{contemporary}} work forces, {{under the pressure of}} cost effectiveness through employment flexiblility. <b>Temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> keep unique dual ralationships with the user firm and the agency and also show different level of organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency. Organizational commitment {{play an important role in}} terms of an organization’s overall productivity as well as an individual’s job satisfaction and well-being. Especially, affective organizational commitment, i. e. an employee’s voluntary emotional attachment to an organization, is known as the strongest dimension related to job satisfaction, well-being and job productivity. In this thesis, I aimed to investigate <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ dual affective commitment particularly in the South Korean institutional settings. My analysis implied that: (1) <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency would be cooperative rather than competing in general; (2) <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> <b>workers</b> would show higher level of affective organizational commitment to the user firm than to the agency; (3) perceived organizational supports from the user firm and from the agency respectively would have a significantly positive relationship with affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency, which was consistent with the social exchange theory. Above all, my analysis suggested that an organization’s non-financial supports would do more effectively influence <b>temporary</b> <b>agency</b> workers’ affective organizational commitment than financial supports...|$|R
