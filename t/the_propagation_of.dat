5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding <b>the</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that <b>the</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E

In this paper, we present a detailed analytical model that characterizes <b>the</b> <b>propagation</b> dynamics <b>of</b> Bluetooth worms. Our model captures not only the behavior of the Bluetooth protocol but also the impact of mobility patterns on <b>the</b> Bluetooth worm <b>propagation.</b> Validation experiments against a detailed discrete-event Bluetooth worm simulator reveal that our model predicts <b>the</b> <b>propagation</b> dynamics <b>of</b> Bluetooth worms with high accuracy.
