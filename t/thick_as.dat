5|$|Anderson {{performed}} the entire album live on tour in 2012, the first complete performances since the original tour. In August 2014, Anderson released the CD/DVD/Blu-ray <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick - Live in Iceland. The concert {{was recorded in}} Reykjavík, Iceland, on 22 June 2012 and featured complete <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick and <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick 2 performances by the Ian Anderson Touring Band. Some of the humour and stage antics were maintained, specially the telephone ringing {{in the middle of}} the song, replaced by a cell phone and a Skype call.|$|E

5|$|The {{follow-up}} {{album was}} released on 2 April 2012. It describes five different scenarios of Gerald Bostock's life, where he potentially becomes a greedy investment banker, a homeless homosexual man, {{a soldier in the}} Afghan War, a sanctimonious evangelist preacher, and a most ordinary man who runs a corner store and is married and childless. <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick 2 lists 17 separate songs merged into 13 distinct tracks (some labelled as medleys), although also all flowing together much like a single song. To follow the style of the mock newspaper on the original <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick, a mock online newspaper was set up.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on 25 February 1972. It was held back a week to 3 March following production problems relating to the 1972 miners' strike. The album reached the top 5 in the UK charts, and number one in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it was certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> those in the surrounding subcortex.|$|E
50|$|The modern ranat ek {{model has}} 21 keys. The lowest-toned key is 38 cm long, 5 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick. The keys {{decrease}} {{in size and}} become <b>thicker</b> <b>as</b> the tones go higher. The highest-toned key is 30 cm long.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in late 1971, featuring music composed by Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members. The live show promoting the album included the playing of the full suite, with various comic interludes. <b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick is considered by critics {{to be the first}} release by Jethro Tull entirely consisting of progressive rock music. It received mixed reviews upon its release: nonetheless, it was a commercial success and topped various charts in 1972. Today it is regarded as a classic of progressive rock and has received several accolades. Anderson produced a follow-up to the album in 2012, focusing on the adult life of the fictional Gerald Bostock.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> that of a snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested {{that it could be}} a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E

5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick is {{the fifth}} studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, {{released}} in March 1972. The album contains a continuous piece of music, split over two sides of an LP record, and was deliberately designed to parody the concept album genre. The original packaging, designed like a newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>as</b> a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts {{more than a couple of}} minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E

50|$|The coins {{increase}} {{in size and}} weight with value. Of the eight denominations of euro coins, the three lowest denominations are small, resemble copper in colour and are quite thin and light. The next three denominations resemble gold in colour and are <b>thicker</b> <b>as</b> well as heavier. The highest two denominations are bimetallic, being generally larger and thicker than the lower denominations.|$|R
5|$|Coffin, wooden: The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} wooden coffin remains, dated at 5000 BC, {{was found in}} the Tomb 4 at Beishouling, Shaanxi. Clear evidence of a wooden coffin {{in the form of a}} rectangular shape was found in Tomb 152 in an early Banpo site. The Banpo coffin belongs to a four-year-old girl, measuring 1.4m (4.5ft) by 0.55m (1.8ft) and 3–9cm <b>thick.</b> <b>As</b> many as 10 wooden coffins have been found from the Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BC) site at Chengzi, Shandong. The thickness of the coffin, as determined by the number of timber frames in its composition, also emphasized the level of nobility, as mentioned in the Classic of Rites, Xunzi and Zhuangzi. Examples of this have been found in several Neolithic sites; the double coffin, the earliest of which {{was found in the}} Liangzhu culture (3400–2250 BC) site at Puanqiao, Zhejiang, consists of an outer and an inner coffin, while the triple coffin, with its earliest finds from the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) sites at Xizhufeng and Yinjiacheng in Shandong, consists of two outer and one inner coffins.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as <b>thick</b> <b>as</b> what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long period}} of time, one {{believed}} that it was due to the cleaning of the typographic plates as the named of these printings is referring to. In fact, it is not the case at all, as the typographic plates have been cleaned only in 1870. This pale/dull aspect is coming from the usage of a new blanket ("blanchet") much <b>thicker</b> <b>as</b> demonstrated by Louis Basel.|$|R
