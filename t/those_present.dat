5|$|Donald Markwell {{argued that}} {{in the absence of}} such an {{international}} approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to <b>those</b> <b>present</b> during the depression of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, an {{obituary}} published in Washington's Daily National Intelligencer spoke favorably of Eaton. It noted that Chief Justice Roger B. Taney had adjourned a {{session of the}} Supreme Court early in order that <b>those</b> <b>present</b> could attend the funeral.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking over}} the {{administration}} of the country in 1945, the Communist Party changed the administrative model to that of the Soviet Union (regions and raions) in 1950, but changed it back in 1968. Nevertheless, the county borders set then were quite different from <b>those</b> <b>present</b> during the interbellum, as only 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E
5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among <b>those</b> <b>present</b> in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with their fingers off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of <b>those</b> <b>present</b> telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E
5|$|Jane Bulcock {{and her son}} John Bulcock, {{both from}} Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by {{witchcraft}} of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having been one of <b>those</b> <b>present,</b> and John as having turned the spit to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{was born}} in Buda on 7 July 1540. On {{learning}} of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers' camp to inform them of the good news.

Newham was one of ten surviving veterans of the squadron belatedly presented with the US Air Medal in Canberra on 27June 2011, for meritorious service in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Pendulum Publications {{produced}} {{one more}} issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving New Worlds without a publisher. The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive New Worlds; one of <b>those</b> <b>present,</b> Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{within the}} ministry {{came to a}} head on 8 February 1708, when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services. When the Queen seemed to hesitate, Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting. Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues, and several of <b>those</b> <b>present</b> including the Duke of Somerset refused to participate until they returned. Her hand forced, the Queen dismissed Harley.|$|E

5|$|Urban saw Alexios's request as a dual {{opportunity}} to cement Western Europe and reunite the Eastern Orthodox Church with the Roman Catholic Church under his rule. On 27 November 1095, Pope Urban II called together the Council of Clermont, and urged all <b>those</b> <b>present</b> {{to take up}} arms under the sign of the Cross and launch an armed pilgrimage to recover Jerusalem and the East from the Muslims. The response in Western Europe was overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Gardstein, {{the identities of the}} gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist JPEddy suggests that Svaars was among <b>those</b> <b>present.</b> Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that <b>those</b> <b>present</b> consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, <b>those</b> <b>present</b> on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E

5|$|After a British spy boat sinks, {{a marine}} archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is tasked to {{retrieve}} its Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) communication system before the Russians do. After Havelock is murdered by Gonzales, a Cuban hit-man, Bond is ordered {{to find out}} who hired Gonzales. While investigating, Bond is captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of <b>those</b> <b>present</b> with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{force had}} {{surveyed}} the Danish positions around Copenhagen, a council of war was held between Parker, his {{second in command}} Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, and the other British captains. Riou was among <b>those</b> <b>present.</b> Riou had worked closely with Nelson and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead up to the attack, and Nelson duly appointed him commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, with the instruction to deploy his ships to support the main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships ran aground on shoals in the harbour, and a new plan of attack had to be improvised. As Nelson's ships of the line engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Tre Kroner forts and blockships. Despite being heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, they exchanged fire for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties; Riou was hit on {{the head by a}} splinter.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all <b>those</b> <b>present,</b> and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E

40|$|Up to 40 {{per cent}} of <b>those</b> <b>presenting</b> with {{psychiatric}} disorders are also abusing substances, and that figure rises to 60 per cent {{in the case}} of those who have committed suicide. And doctors treating substance abuse addicts at Dublin's Rutland centre have discovered that <b>those</b> <b>presenting</b> for treatment for addiction are also experiencing depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges. This, according to the Rutland's Centre's newly appointed clinical director, Dr Fiona Weldon, is "a reflection of the changing landscape in the use of mood-altering substances that have an impact on mental health, such as cocaine, hash and head-shop substances". The Rutland Centre has also seen an increase in <b>those</b> <b>presenting</b> with co-existing mental health issues and eating disorders. As a result, Dr Weldon has launched two new programmes to meet the growing demand for services to deal with issues in the area of addiction and eating disorders...|$|R
