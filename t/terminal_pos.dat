5000|$|All {{states have}} systems that use {{magnetic}} stripe cards and [...] "on-line" [...] authorization of transactions. When paying for groceries, the SNAP customer's card is run through an electronic reader or {{a point of}} sale <b>terminal</b> (<b>POS),</b> and the recipient enters the secret PIN to access the food stamp account. Then, electronically, the processor verifies the PIN and the account balance, and sends an authorization or denial back to the retailer. The recipient's account is then debited {{for the amount of}} the purchase, and the retailer's account is credited. No cash money changes hands. Payment is made to the retailer through an ACH settlement process {{at the end of the}} business day. Most states' online EBT systems are interoperable through the Quest network, which is sponsored by the Electronic Benefits and Services Council (formerly the EBT Council) of NACHA.|$|E
50|$|For example, a point-of-sale <b>terminal</b> (<b>POS</b> terminal, a {{computerized}} cash register) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, {{this list of}} grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a software program or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a calculator, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per {{day of the week}} by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times. Such information could then become data for further processing, for example as part of a predictive marketing campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a database, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{existing}} <b>POS</b> <b>terminals</b> are connected through wired networks, and therefore fixed at some certain positions, e.g., in shopping malls, restaurants, super markets, railway stations, and airports. If a person is interested to use a <b>POS</b> <b>terminal,</b> then he has to visit the <b>POS</b> <b>terminal.</b> This might cause inconveniences for the users [67]. On the other hand, remotely located <b>POS</b> <b>terminals</b> (e.g., ticketing machines, and parking meters) require a wired connection which is not cost efficient and also difficult to be installed. In addition, this may also be exposed to damages. The other option is {{to take advantage of}} mobile networks to connect <b>POS</b> <b>terminals.</b> However, this approach poses some security limitations. Introducing M 2 M devices enable additional possibilities for applications. For instance, online transaction with credit/debit cards and secure communication can be offered with the help of M 2 M devices which can be deployed in, e.g., parking, stations, airports, and e-ticketing terminals. Typically, these devices have to fulfill several security requirements, e.g., for financial transactions.|$|R

40|$|Exploiting an {{original}} dataset of non-cash payments {{during the period}} between 1996 and 2005, this study analyses the diffusion patterns of non-cash payments in China. Based on both exponential and Gompertz curves, the point of sale (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminal</b> has shown a higher diffusion rate than that of automatic teller machines (ATMs). This result is also robust when a time trend is interacted with rivals' precedence, network effects and market concentration. The diffusion rates of both ATM and <b>POS</b> <b>terminals</b> have accelerated after 2002, when UnionPay was established in China. The diffusion rate of ATMs {{is found to be}} mainly driven by rivals' adoption of them.
