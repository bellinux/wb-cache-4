50|$|In antiquity, jewelry often contains, in {{the form}} of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is {{accurately}} made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in Egypt by the 2nd Dynasty. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the gold wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the strip wire drawing method. The strip <b>twist</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturing method was superseded by drawing in the ancient Old World sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD. There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{analysis}} of drawing square and square <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> is presented. The thermomechanical simulation {{of the drawing}} process of square wire was carried out using the viscoplastic body model for a three-dimensional strain state {{with the use of}} Forge 2007 software, while the properties of the material being deformed were described with the Norton-Hoff law. In this paper the distribution of effective strains and longitudinal stresses during changes of the crosssection and <b>twisting</b> of the <b>wires</b> has been demonstrated. It was determined that square <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> are characterized by significant inhomogeneity of strain. For verification of obtained numerical results experimental investigation was performed for square and square <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> drawing in laboratory conditions.

40|$|Fertility and {{abundance}} are important themes of ancient Mesopotamian texts and images. The goddess Inanna and her consort Dumuzi personify these ideas in {{texts of the}} second millennium B. C. E.

Among the tombs, that of Queen Puabi yielded many ornaments of gold, carnelian, and lapis. Some of the pendants realistically depict identifiable animals.

40|$|Abstract — To achieve small {{delay and}} low {{crosstalk}} for multiple signal nets with capacitive and inductive coupling, we propose {{in this paper}} a novel interconnect structure, staggered twisted-bundle wires where groups of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> are staggered. This new structure {{is different from the}} previously proposed <b>twisted</b> bundle <b>wires</b> with one group of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> and another group of normal wires. Using accurate circuit models and efficient algorithms to find the worst case noise and delay for comprehensive combinations of signal patterns and a range of arrival times, we assume signal and shielding ratio over 1 : 1 for area reduction and compare the aforementioned two structures to coplanar shielding for signal nets. The staggered twisted-bundle has the smallest worst case delay, up to 20 % and 5 % smaller than the coplanar shielding and twisted bundle, respectively. The staggered twisted bundle also has the smallest worst case noise, up to 6 % and 12 % less than coplanar shielding and twisted bundle. Furthermore, the staggered twisted bundle has the smallest delay/noise variation between signal nets. We conclude that without increasing routing area, the staggered twisted bundle is better than the twisted bundle and coplanar shielding in terms of performance and noise. I...|$|R
40|$|A self-developed rotary multi-cutter device cuts {{stainless}} steel wire ropes into segments to fabricate <b>twisted</b> <b>wires.</b> Stainless steel porous <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> materials (PTWMs) with a spatial composite intertexture structure are produced by the compaction and subsequent vacuum solid-phase sintering of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires.</b> The {{stainless steel}} PTWMs show two types of typical uniaxial tensile failure modes, i. e., a 45 ° angle fracture mode and an auxetic failure mode (the PTWMs expand along the direction perpendicular to the tension). The effects of the sintering parameters, porosities, wire diameters, and sampling direction on the tensile properties of the PTWMs are carefully investigated. By increasing the sintering temperature from 1130 °C to 1330 °C, the tensile strength of the PTWMs with 70 % target porosity increased from 7. 7 MPa to 28. 6 MPa and the total failure goes down to 50 %. When increasing the sintering time from 90 min to 150 min, the tensile strength increases from 12. 4 MPa to 19. 1 MPa and the total failure elongation drops to 78. 6 %. The tensile strength of the PTWMs increases from 28. 9 MPa to 112. 7 MPa with decreasing porosity from 69. 5 % to 46. 0 %, and the total failure elongation also increases from 14. 8 % to 40. 7 %. The tensile strength and the failure strain of the PTWMs with fine wires are {{higher than those of}} the PTWMs with coarse wires under the same porosity. Sampling direction has a small influence on the tensile properties of the PTWMs...|$|R
