This study experimentally demonstrates that, by using suitable shielding material around Am/Be neutron source, the dose <b>transmission</b> <b>factor</b> of borated polythene is small compared to the dose <b>transmission</b> <b>factor</b> of polythene for any given thickness, and that the neutron source-detector distance of 90 cm being a position where the Am/Be neutron source is very close to the centre of the water tank was found to be the best position for the neutron source to guarantee the safety of the radiation workers...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} wave {{equation}} {{of a massive}} vector boson {{in the background of}} a D-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. The mass term introduces a coupling between two physical degrees of freedom of the field, and we solve the resulting system of ODEs numerically, without decoupling. We show how to define decoupled <b>transmission</b> <b>factors</b> from an S-matrix and compute them for various modes, masses and space-time dimensions. The mass term lifts the degeneracy between transverse modes, in D= 4, and excites the longitudinal modes, in particular the s-wave. Moreover, it increases the contribution of waves with larger angular momentum, which can be dominant at intermediate energies. The <b>transmission</b> <b>factors</b> are then used to obtain the Hawking fluxes in this channel. Our results alert for the importance of modelling the longitudinal modes correctly, instead of treating them as decoupled scalars as in current black hole event generators; thus they can be used to improve such generators for phenomenological studies of TeV gravity scenarios.

DESIGN: Individuals diagnosed with acute HCV between 1999 and 2005 at three urban HIV units in the UK were enrolled into a phylogenetic and case-control study. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the amplified sequences of the E 1 /E 2 region of the HCV genome and were used to compare cases with unrelated sequences. A questionnaire-based, case-control study using matched controls recruited from each HIV unit identified putative <b>transmission</b> <b>factors.</b> RESULTS: One hundred and eleven HIV-positive {{men who have sex}} with men with acute HCV (genotype 1 : 84 %) were enrolled. Phylogenetic analysis of 93 E 1 /E 2 sequences revealed seven monophyletic clusters signifying multiple independent HCV lineages co-circulating in the HIV-positive population. Permucosal rather than percutaneous <b>transmission</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with case/control status. Cases (n = 60) had more sexual partners, increased levels of high-risk sexual behaviour and were more likely to have shared drugs via a nasal or anal route in the preceding year in comparison with controls (n = 130). Sex in a group of more than two people was the strongest predictor of case/control status; odds ratios associated with participation in two or at least three types of high-risk sexual behaviour in a group were 9. 16 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 51 - 23. 90) and 23. 50 (95 % confidence interval, 9. 47 - 58. 33), respectively.
