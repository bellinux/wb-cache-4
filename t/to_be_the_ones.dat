5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E
25|$|Most textual {{critics of}} the New Testament favor the Alexandrian text-type as the closest {{representative}} of the autographs for many reasons. One reason is that Alexandrian manuscripts are the oldest found; {{some of the earliest}} church fathers used readings found in the Alexandrian text.

The inspiration of their work stems mainly from the lives of everyday people in Slovak rurals which they admired and idealised. The painters influenced by Art Nouveau, symbolism and expressionism are Zolo Palugyay (1898–1935), Anton Jasusch (1882–1965), Edmund Gwerk (1895–1956) or Július Jakoby (1903–1985).

25|$|Birds do not {{necessarily}} exhibit sleep debt, but a peculiarity that birds share with aquatic mammals, and possibly also with certain species of lizards (opinions differ about that last point), is the ability for unihemispheric sleep. That {{is the ability to}} sleep with one cerebral hemisphere at a time, while the other hemisphere is awake (Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep). When only one hemisphere is sleeping, only the contralateral eye will be shut; that is, when the right hemisphere is asleep the left eye will be shut, and vice versa. The distribution of sleep between the two hemispheres and the amount of unihemispheric sleep are determined both by which part of the brain has been the most active during the previous period of wake—that part will sleep the deepest—and it is also determined by the risk of attacks from predators. Ducks near the perimeter of the flock are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that first will detect predator attacks. These ducks have significantly more unihemispheric sleep than those who sleep {{in the middle of the}} flock, and they react to threatening stimuli seen by the open eye.|$|E

500|$|Angelou's poems {{have been}} {{compared}} to music and musical forms. The poems in her fourth volume, Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983), have {{been compared to}} the music of French singer Édith Piaf. In her review of Shaker, Janet Blundell finds the best poems in the volume <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that are structured like blues music. Critic Harold Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Composition" [...] in Diiie to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Blundell, in her review of Angelou's third volume And Still I Rise (1978) in Library Journal, finds Angelou's poems which mimic speech patterns and songs the most effective. [...] However, she finds Angelou's other poems [...] "mired in hackneyed metaphor and forced rhyme".|$|E

500|$|Librarian John Alfred Avant {{states that}} many of Angelou's poems could be set to music like that of jazz singer and {{musician}} Nina Simone, especially the first poem in this section, [...] "They Went Home," [...] which he says [...] "fits into the torchy unrequited love bag". [...] Hagen considers Angelou's best poems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> meant to be song lyrics, such as [...] "They Went Home". [...] In his analysis of [...] "They Went Home", Hagen calls Angelou a realist because she recognizes that the married man who dates other women usually returns to his wife. [...] He states, [...] "While the sentiment is psychologically sound, the lines are prosaic, reflecting the pitiful state of the abandoned". [...] Essick, when analyzing [...] "When I Think About Myself", states that the poem central theme is [...] "one's self-exultation and self-pride that prevent one from losing her will in spite of experiences involving pain and degradation".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that the rich ... are always going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> getting {{the gun at}} the end of the day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E

2500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for this decline; {{a combination of factors}} is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. According {{to a study by the}} Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965. Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races. Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in Democracy and Technology that technological developments in society such as [...] "automobilization," [...] suburban living, and [...] "an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices" [...] have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{manner of}} {{repairing}} her inconsistency was altogether feminine: {{she wished to}} extract a certainty {{at the same time}} that she wished to deprecate a pledge, and she would have been delighted to put Verena into the enjoyment of that freedom which was so important for her by preventing her exercising it in a particular direction. The girl was now completely under her influence; she had latent curiosities and distractions--left to herself, she was not always thinking of the unhappiness of women; but the touch of Olive's tone worked a spell, and she found something to which at least a portion of her nature turned with eagerness in her companion's wider knowledge, her elevation of view. Miss Chancellor was historic and philosophic; or, at any rate, she appeared so to Verena, who felt that through such an association one might at last intellectually command all life. And there was a simpler impulse; Verena wished to please her if only because she had such a dread of displeasing her. Olive's displeasures, disappointments, disapprovals were tragic, truly memorable; she grew white under them, not shedding many tears, as a general thing, like inferior women (she cried when she was angry, not when she was hurt), but limping and panting, morally, as if she had received a wound that she would carry for life. On the other hand, her commendations, her satisfactions were as soft as a west wind; and she had this sign, the rarest of all, of generosity, that she liked obligations of gratitude when they were not laid upon her by men. Then, indeed, she scarcely recognised them. She considered men in general as so much in the debt of the opposite sex that any individual woman had an unlimited credit with them; she could not possibly overdraw the general feminine account. The unexpected temperance of her speech on this subject of Verena's accessibility to matrimonial error seemed to the girl to have an antique beauty, a wisdom purged of worldly elements; it reminded her of qualities that she believed to have been proper to Electra or Antigone. This made her wish the more to do something that would gratify Olive; and in spite of her friend's dissuasion she declared that she should like to promise. [...] "I will promise, at any rate, not to marry any of those gentlemen that were at the house," [...] she said. [...] "Those seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> you were principally afraid of." ...|$|E
