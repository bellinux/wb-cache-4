5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking {{the essence of the}} band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, {{it would be great to}} see what we could do together. And <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger as a starting point for that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what we heard from doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
500|$|On May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly {{announced}} that Wright {{was leaving the}} project due to [...] "differences in their vision of the film", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On the split, Wright said, [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} Marvel movie but I don’t think <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make an Edgar Wright movie." [...] He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which was [...] "a tough thing to move forward" [...] as Wright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued, [...] "Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you’re there, really." [...] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project {{in the wake of his}} departure. By May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright, but pulled out of negotiations the next day. On June 7, Marvel {{announced that}} Peyton Reed would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script. Other directors that had been under consideration include Ruben Fleischer, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Nicholas Stoller, Michael Dowse, and David Wain.|$|E

For one thing, if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E
2500|$|Although Russell {{had planned}} to release the film before November 2004, hoping to [...] "perhaps make a {{difference}} before the election," [...] Warner Bros. abandoned the project at the last minute, citing [...] "controversy surrounding the documentary, combined with a later-than-expected arrival of the bonus footage". Russell disputed the time-crunch excuse, saying [...] "I think if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> they could make it happen." [...] Eventually, the documentary was purchased by the Independent Film Channel, where it was aired in its entirety {{the night before the}} 2004 U.S. presidential election.|$|E

[...] Snowden added, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> capture me, they would've allowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can operate with impunity down there.

2500|$|While guitars {{have been}} (minimally) present {{even in their}} early work, their {{appearance}} in the final mix has always been very slight, and even today that Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as {{to be more than}} barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as [...] "the band with no guitars", thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using delay and distortion effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren't immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was try something different. He referred to the piano as an odd instrument to form part of a rock band instrumentation, comparing it to The Beatles' set of instruments. Rice-Oxley's distortion piano has been key to most of Keane's multifaceted style and most definitely their most recognizable asset.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, artist Matt Haley and Twin Peaks {{producer}} Bob Engels {{began work}} on a graphic novel continuation of the series, {{to be included in}} the [...] "Complete Mystery" [...] DVD box set. Haley stated: [...] "Bob and I had a number of discussions about what the story would be, I was keen to use whatever notes they had for the proposed third season. I really wanted this to be a literal 'third season' of the show. Bob told me <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get away from the high school setting, so after the resolution of the Cooper-BOB-possession plot point, they would have cut to something like 'Ten Years Later', and then shown us a Twin Peaks where Cooper had quit the FBI and had become the town pharmacist, Sheriff Truman had become a recluse, etc. He also mentioned they were going to have Sheryl Lee come back, this time as a redhead, and probably have her character killed by BOB again. There were also some vague ideas about BOB and Mike being from a planet made of creamed corn, something about Truman driving Mike backwards through the portal into the Black Lodge (which I think would have been a really nice cinematic scene)." [...] Lynch vetoed the project, stating that he respected the effort but did not want to continue the story of Twin Peaks in any way.|$|E

I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|R
2500|$|Music producer, Steve Morales, took T Lopez to Miami, Florida {{to begin}} {{recording}} her own music. Later Lopez {{would join the}} cast of a TV cable network that caters to the bicultural Latino population called Sí TV, where she would co-hosts a Latin American music show, The Drop. Lopez continued acting, hosting, and recording music. After putting a few movies, multiple TV appearances, and an album's worth of songs under her belt, T Lopez met brothers and co-CEO's of Cash Money Records, Ronald [...] "Slim" [...] Williams and Bryan [...] "Baby" [...] Williams, and they invited her to visit their New Orleans, Louisiana home base. T Lopez was very impressed by their loyalty to each other, but she asked the guys if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with her and her music {{because it was so}} different. Slim is great, he takes great care of me and he is really involved in my project T Lopez said. T Lopez said that heads of companies are not always like that. Then T Lopez officially joined the Cash Money family and has not looked back since. T Lopez is currently recording on her as-yet-untitled solo debut album in Miami, Florida, with features from T-Pain, Daddy Yankee, Lil Wayne, Flo Rida, Glasses Malone, Colby O'Donis and Birdman. Producers Timbaland, J.R. Rotem, Rodney Jerkins are also along to build what's best described as urban pop.

I did not marry her for her accomplishments. But now she is beginning to think she must have been accomplished all the time, without knowing it. She plays the piano like a schoolgirl on a parents' visiting-day. She told them she did not play--not worth listening to--at least, she began by telling them so. They insisted that she did, that they had heard about her playing, and were thirsting to enjoy it. She is good nature itself. She would stand on her head if she thought it would give real joy to anyone. She took it <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear her, and so let 'em have it. They tell her that her touch is something quite out of the common--which is the truth, if only she could understand it--why did she never think of taking up music as a profession? By this time she is wondering herself that she never did. They are not satisfied with hearing her once. They ask for more, and they get it. The other evening I had to keep quiet on my chair while she thumped through four pieces one after the other, including the Beethoven Sonata. We knew it was the Beethoven Sonata. She told us before she started {{it was going to be}} the Beethoven Sonata, otherwise, for all any of us could have guessed, it might have been the 'Battle of Prague.' We all sat round with wooden faces, staring at our boots. Afterwards those of them that couldn't get near enough to her to make a fool of her crowded round me. Wanted to know why I had never told them I had discovered a musical prodigy. I'll lose my temper one day and pull somebody's nose, I feel I shall. She's got a recitation; whether intended to be serious or comic I had never been able to make up my mind. The way she gives it confers upon it all the disadvantages of both. It is chiefly concerned with an angel and a child. But a dog comes into it about the middle, and from that point onward it is impossible to tell who is talking--sometimes you think it is the angel, and then it sounds more like the dog. The child is the easiest to follow: it talks all the time through its nose. If I have heard that recitation once I have heard it fifty times; and now she is busy learning an encore.|$|E
