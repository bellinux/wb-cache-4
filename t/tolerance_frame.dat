To do so, we applied a framework consisting of five governance capabilities required to deal with wicked problems (reflexivity, responsiveness, resilience, revitalization and rescaling) to a case study of how the Commission deals with the wicked problem of food security.

This single VLSI device, known as the Parallel Integrated Frame Synchronizer (PIFS) chip, integrates most of the functionality contained in high density 9 U VME card frame synchronizer subsystems currently in use. In 1987, a first generation 20 Mbps VMEBus frame synchronizer based on 2. 0 micron CMOS VLSI technology was developed by Data Systems Technology Division. In 1990, this subsystem architecture was recast using 0. 8 micron ECL & GaAs VLSI to achieve 300 Mbps performance. The PIFS chip, based on 0. 7 micron CMOS technology, will provide a superset of the current VMEBus subsystem functions at rates up to 500 Mbps at approximately one-tenth current replication costs.

40|$|Focusing on a {{lived and}} practiced tolerance, this thesis {{sets out to}} explore {{questions}} concerning education for tolerance, and, specifically, how teachers and educators can prepare students to become tolerating subjects in their everyday encounters with others. Taking its point of departure in real and fictional classroom situations, the overall {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the ethical and transformative potential inherent in education for <b>tolerance.</b> The theoretical <b>frame</b> of the study is deconstruction and the philosophical writings of JacquesDerrida. The purpose of the thesis is accomplished in three movements. The first aims to show why teachers and educators need to redirect their attention in the classroom if the ethical and transformative potential that lies in education for tolerance is to be taken seriously. Instead of focusing on the tolerated and “deviating” other, it proposes that the tolerating subject should be the center of attention. The second movement aims to prepare the ground for a deconstructive reading by mapping different contemporary discourses of tolerance. Three distinct but interrelated dilemmas of tolerance are identified: the dilemma of welcoming, the dilemma of drawing boundaries, and the dilemma of bearing or enduring the otherness of the other. The third movement aims to show how a deconstructive reading of the dilemmas of tolerance can help teachers and educators to perceive and relate otherwise to the tolerating subject in education. For this, I turn to Derrida’s deconstructions of three concepts that are vital for our understanding of tolerance: hospitality, justice and mourning. The final section of the thesis discusses some educational implications deriving from the study. It is argued that {{if we look at the}} tolerating subject through the experience of its deconstruction, we also come to see education for tolerance otherwise. What this altered perspective can mean for education is articulated within the framework of what is calleda pedagogy of tolerance. Kommer ev. att publiceras på förlag. </p...|$|R

Sysco’s main page devoted to animal welfare dominated the word count with 1, 045 words, while JBS®’s main animal welfare page used only 265 words to communicate the company’s views. The most commonly identified topic was policy. The predominant frames were being recognized as an industry leader and animal care vs. profit. In the second article, researchers conducted a similar content analysis on the Twitter efforts of the five companies and their audiences. Tweets relating to animal welfare originating from the companies and audiences were collected from November 2016 to May 2017 and were coded for common topics, persuasive frames, and tone. The Twitter traffic was compared to findings from the first study, which described the companies’ animal welfare web pages. Findings indicated it was common practice for the companies to tweet rarely regarding animal welfare. In fact, only three tweets related to animal welfare topics were identified among the companies’ Twitter traffic in the period that bounded the study.

40|$|Alkaline soils {{used for}} dryland {{cropping}} across the semi-arid regions of south=eastern Australia typically have {{high levels of}} salinity (ECe), sodicity (ESP) and soluble boron (B) in the subsoil. The current research was undertaken to improve our knowledge of the physicochemical characteristics of these alkaline soils and assess what impact they have on the growth and water use of cereals. A survey of representative alkaline soils of the southern Mallee and Wimmera regions of Victoria, comprising 140 Calcarosol profiles and 10 Vertosol profiles, revealed high correlation between exchangeable Na+ and both ESP (r = 0. 96) and B (r = 0. 88). ESP and ECe (r = 0. 71) and B and pH 1 : 5 (r = 0. 70) were also highly correlated. Readily measured properties (field texture, pH 1 : 5, ECe and exchangeable Na+) were found to provide good estimates of ESP and boron in these soils. Overall, ESP was best defined as 1. 47 + 2. 68 x Na+ (r 2 = 93. 9) and boron by 0. 34 + 3. 93 x Na+ (r 2 = 76. 7). A break point values for pH was defined such that soils with pH 1 : 5 < 8. 1 have low levels of soil boron that are not potentially toxic to cereal growth. The growth and water use of the boron tolerant wheat cultivar, Frame, was monitored on these soils during the 1999 -growing season. A descriptive model that explained 54 % of the variation in grain yield (range: 1. 3 - 6. 1 Mg/ha) was established using ridge regression analysis, which is not confounded by the correlation that exists between the physicochemical factors (collinearity). The statistical analysis identified rainfall around anthesis, available soil water in the 0. 10 - 0. 40 m layer at sowing, nitrate in the 0 - 0. 10 m layer and salinity and sodicity in the 0. 60 - 1. 00 m layer as significant explanatory variables for grain yield and water use. Subsoil salinity (ECe) and sodicity (ESP) were effective surrogates for extractability of water in the deep subsoil. It is estimated that crops can make use of water at depth if subsoils have ECe < 8 dS/m and ESP < 19 %. Levels of soluble soil boron (reaching concentrations of up to 52 mg/kg), were not significantly correlated with root growth, water uptake or yield of wheat. It is proposed that the boron <b>tolerance</b> of cv. <b>Frame</b> rendered high boron as non-limiting and that the high Na+ in these soils had an overriding effect in driving variation in crop yield. The impact of boron tolerance, watering regime and soil disturbance on the growth and water use of near-isogenic lines of wheat and barley was assessed using large intact soil cores (0. 3 m diam. x 1. 0 m height), containing an alkaline soil (Calcarosol) sampled from the southern Mallee. Within the subsoil (0. 80 - 0. 90 m) ECes, ESP and B was 8. 1 dS/m, 29 % and 31 mg/kg respectively. In the shallower (0. 61 - 0. 71 m) layer respective levels were 7. 2 dS/m, 22 % and 29 mg/kg. Crop root growth between these layers decreased significantly with depth and no net water extraction occurred beyond 0. 80 m, irrespective of crop boron tolerance. As the concentration of soil boron was equivalent across these layers, it was discounted from being a constraint to water extraction by crop. Rather, the increase in EC 0 and more so ESP suggests these factors were constraining water use at depth. Grain yield per unit of applied water for wheat and barley grown under low water supply was 1. 5 times that of their high water counterparts, suggesting inefficiencies in water capture by crops under the high water regime. Deep ripping had no effect on grain yield. Importantly these results showed boron tolerance provided little benefit to cereals on soil where constraints in addition to high boron exist. A glasshouse trial was conducted to assess how interactive effects of boron and salinity and cultivar affected the early growth of wheat using a range of soil salinity and soluble boron levels observed in the field survey. The three cultivars, Frame, BT Schomburgk and Schomburgk, varied significantly in tolerance to boron, with critical soil concentrations were estimated at 53, 32 and 27 mg/kg respectively in the absence of salinity. These 3 varieties did not differ in tolerance to salt in the absence of high boron, where cultivars equally tolerated ECe = 9 dS/m. Boron and Na+ in shoot tissue could not be used to define critical concentration for toxicity. This trial demonstrates the value Of using genetic variation for adaptation of wheat to high levels of boron, but appears not the case for salt tolerance here. This thesis confirmed that, due to the strong intercorrelation that exists between the physicochemical factors, salinity, sodicity and soluble boron, that these factors are likely to operate simultaneously to reduce cereal growth. Adequate boron tolerance currently appears to exist in commercial wheat cultivars i. e. Frame, enabling these varieties to withstand the high boron levels encountered in the alkaline cropping soils of north-western Victoria. High. levels of salinity and sodicity, however, {{are more likely to be}} constraining growth through osmotic, toxic and physical impediment. This thesis indicates the need for improve tolerance of cereals to salinity and the need for pyramiding tolerances for crops targeted to alkaline soils where constraints exist together.
