5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received some technical changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic lights to help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, approved of the project, and put the project up for bids for construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The queue begins {{adjacent}} to the DC Super Heroes Store, opposite Batwing Spaceshot. The queue weaves its way alongside the park's original boundary wall. Along this route several billboards inform guests of {{the story behind the}} Green Lantern. Riders <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> and enter a courtyard featuring 2D cutouts of villains as well as a 3D model of the Green Lantern.|$|E

50|$|Circuit = west on Rijksweg in Vilt, {{continuing}} through Berg en Terblijt onto Bergerstraat, <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> grazing Maastricht {{on the east}} by going south on Molenweg, then <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> and continuing east on Bemelerweg, continuing onto Oude Akerstraat and Bemelerberg through Bemelen, continuing onto Gasthuis, <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> and continuing northeast On Smitserweg, which turns into Bemelerweg grazing Sibbe on the west and into Daalhemerweg curving to north {{all the way into}} Valkenburg aan de Geul, at the end <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> onto Cauberg, back to Vilt.|$|R
50|$|The route {{begins at}} its {{southern}} terminus in Dixfield. It heads north through Carthage before <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> at SR 156 in Weld. It goes north again before turning right onto a 1.3 mi concurrency with SR 4 in Phillips. It <b>turns</b> <b>left</b> twice there before going northwest to Kingfield, then another <b>left</b> <b>turn</b> {{leads to the}} route's northern terminus.|$|R
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should <b>turn</b> <b>left.</b> In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main {{beneficiary}} of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. His will {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in <b>turn,</b> <b>left</b> one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Rather than <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, at {{the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E

5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a human operator.|$|E
5|$|John Manners died in 1402, {{probably}} {{leaving the}} castle to his son, Robert, who in <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> {{the property to}} his own son, another John Manners. John {{was involved in a}} long-running feud with the neighbouring Heron family, who owned the neighbouring Ford Castle, and on 20 January 1428 there was a fight between the two sides outside Etal Castle, in which William Heron died. The precise events are unclear and formed the basis of a subsequent lawsuit, but John argued that William had assaulted the castle, during which attack he had died, and that John had no direct involvement in his death. William's widow blamed John and his eldest son, also called John, for William's death and demanded compensation. After arbitration by the Church, eventually John agreed to pay for 500 masses for William's soul, and to give 250 marks to his widow.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 2016, EVA Air Flight BR 15 (Boeing 777-300ER B-16726, Delivered January 2016) from Los Angeles International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport {{narrowly}} missed hitting Mount Wilson and Air Canada Flight 788. The LAX {{control tower}} mistakenly tells the pilot to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> instead of right to {{head over the}} ocean. BR 15 instead headed north and was maintaining 5000 feet as it headed towards 5700 foot peak Mt. Wilson. EVA was forced to climb to 6000 feet. Air Canada Flight 788, also from LAX was taking the same route BR 15 was. Air Canada Flight 788 was forced to climb to over 10000 feet to avoid hitting BR 15. It took almost two minutes for the pilot to make a 180 degree turn to go southbound. An investigation is being held and EVA Air also did not comment.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Doctor and Donna {{exploring}} a marketplace on the Asian styled planet Shan Shen. Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was driving along with her mother, Sylvia, through London {{to get a new}} job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> to get to the security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to turn right this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasingâ€”a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
25|$|Any flight departing {{over the}} lough must <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> to head north (further from land) at 500 feet. Only after {{reaching}} 2,000 feet (for turboprops) or 3,000 feet (for jet aircraft) may they then turn south to move over land again.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1989, US 11 {{followed}} an older alignment bypassing Downtown Scranton. From Pittston Avenue, US 11 turned right onto Moosic Street {{and climbed the}} hill. At Crown Avenue, it <b>turned</b> <b>left,</b> joining PA 307 which {{was coming from the}} opposite direction on Moosic Street. Together they crossed the Harrison Avenue bridge and continued about a mile to Myrtle Street. PA 307 and US 11 turned right on Myrtle for one block then left on Wheeler Avenue. After entering the Borough of Dunmore and crossing the old Erie Railroad tracks, the pair <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> on Cherry Street then bore right onto South Blakely Street, entering Downtown Dunmore. They <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> onto Green Ridge Street, re-entering Scranton in the Green Ridge section of the city. At the end of Green Ridge Street at North Scranton Junior High School, they turned right onto Main Avenue entering the Providence section of the city. After a half mile, they <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> onto West Market Street. PA 307 left US 11 by <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> onto Keyser Avenue. US 11 continued on West Market Street to Saltry Place, where it <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> for one block then right onto the North Scranton Expressway. From it, it joined its current alignment heading towards Clarks Summit. At one time, this final intersection with the expressway was a 4-way traffic circle servicing Oak Street, Market Street, the Scranton Carbondale Highway (US 6), and Northern Boulevard (today's US 11).|$|R

25|$|The {{terrain and}} poor {{quality of the}} roads made his advance difficult. Eventually, at the exit of the small village of Thirimont, the {{spearhead}} was unable to take the direct road toward Ligneuville. Peiper again deviated from his planned route. Rather than <b>turn</b> <b>left,</b> the spearhead veered right and advanced towards the crossroads of Baugnez, which is equidistant from Malmedy, Ligneuville, and Waimes.|$|E
25|$|Corner sight {{distance}} (CSD) is the road alignment specification {{which provides a}} substantially clear line of sight so that the driver of a vehicle, bicyclist or pedestrian waiting at the crossroad may safely anticipate the driver of an approaching vehicle. Corner sight provides an adequate time for the waiting user to either cross all lanes of through traffic, cross the near lanes and <b>turn</b> <b>left,</b> or turn right, without requiring through traffic to radically alter their speed.|$|E
25|$|Reagan National Airport is {{in between}} two {{overlapping}} No Fly Zone so pilots {{have to watch}} out for the Pentagon and CIA headquarters. And on takeoff, pilots must ascend quickly and sharply <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> so they don't fly over the White House. After the attacks of September 11, security forces strongly enforce these rules. Reagan National has extra security precautions required by the Washington Air Defense Identification Zone that have been in place since the airport began operations.|$|E
