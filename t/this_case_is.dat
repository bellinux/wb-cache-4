5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. <b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.

30|$|There {{are some}} rare reports of extrahepatic HCC without primary hepatic parenchymal lesions [2, 11]; hence, the bile duct tumors in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> might <b>be</b> new HCC lesions.

5|$|In 2017, A {{man with}} {{criminal}} {{and drug abuse}} history attempted to rob a store in Prague, armed with a knife.

5|$|The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation {{established}} the Mine Survey Institute at Khewra in 1971.

5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law.

5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. <b>This</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects precess until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E

The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid). For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E

5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E
