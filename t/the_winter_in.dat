5|$|Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, {{the company}} met {{to debate the}} wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were {{unfamiliar}} with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and Church agents.

He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women and young children would lead to suffering, sickness and even death. All of the other Church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, {{perhaps as many as}} 100, decided to spend <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.|$|E
