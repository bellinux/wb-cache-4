5|$|However, the King did {{not want}} the house himself, and he offered it to his heir-apparent, Beatrice's nephew George, who declined, objecting to the high cost of maintenance. Edward {{subsequently}} extended the grounds of Beatrice's home, Osborne Cottage, to compensate her for the impending loss of her privacy. Shortly afterwards, the King declared <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Balfour, the Prime Minister, that the main house would go to the nation as a gift. An exception was made for the private apartments, which were closed to all but the royal family members, who made it a shrine to their mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|John Ronald Reuel Tolkien {{was born}} on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was {{promoted}} to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who {{was born on}} 17 February 1894.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E

5|$|Toshack had a {{moderately}} successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended {{a sequence of}} deliveries <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Morris at silly point. As the hosts were in trouble, they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{was born}} in the Victorian town of Kyneton on 22 March 1898, the {{youngest}} of seven children <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Wells, a draper, and his wife Elizabeth (née Carter). Educated at Kyneton High School, Wells entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1916, where he was a keen sportsman. Graduating from the college in December 1919, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Army, and posted to England for further training.|$|E

5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
5|$|Arthur {{was served}} by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as Gearoid Óg FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, {{who had been}} brought to the English court as a {{consequence}} of the involvement of his father, Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in the crowning of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII's reign. Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Thomas ap Rhys, Gruffydd grow quite close <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince's tomb.|$|E
5|$|Cetiosauriscus leedsi: In 1887, John Whittaker Hulke named a {{new species}} of sauropod, Ornithopsis leedsi. He {{designated}} BMNH R.1984–1988 as its type series, bones from the collections found by Alfred Nicholson Leeds. In 1905, Harry Govier Seeley made a suggestion <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Smith Woodward, who took Seeley's advice and renamed O. leedsi, Cetiosaurus leedsi. Woodward also referred an additional specimen to the species, BMNH R.3078. The specimen was mounted and displayed {{for many years in}} the Dinosaur Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum) in London. An additional specimen, BMNH R.3706, referred to C. leedsi under the genus Cetiosaurus, includes some ribs, and may belong to a pliosaur. All referrals of C. leedsi outside of Ornithopsis are no longer accepted, and the species is thought to represent a new indeterminate brachiosaurid.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{issued an}} {{executive}} order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. Sherman agreed with Hayes that the three had to resign, but he made clear in a letter <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> {{that he had no}} personal grudge against the Collector. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements but the Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} début {{at the end}} of the 1936–37 season when selected for New South Wales and was later included in the team for the 1938 Australian tour of England, making his Test début in the final international of the series. On the resumption of Test cricket after the war, he was picked as the opening partner <b>to</b> <b>Arthur</b> Morris. Barnes was a member of The Invincibles, the 1948 Australian team that toured England without losing a single match. Retiring from cricket {{at the end of}} that tour, Barnes attempted a comeback to Test cricket in the 1951–52 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful.|$|E
