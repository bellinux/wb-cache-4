50|$|Most larger sea anchors {{will provide}} a {{mechanism}} to collapse the anchor for retrieval. This is called a <b>trip</b> <b>line,</b> and attaches {{to the rear of}} the anchor, allowing it to be pulled in back first, shedding water rather than filling.

50|$|Grapnels {{rarely have}} enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand, clay, or mud. It is not unknown for the anchor to foul {{on its own}} rode, or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom, {{preventing}} it from digging in.

50|$|Weights such as chain {{are also}} {{employed}} {{to keep the}} drogue from breaching {{the surface of the}} water and skimming across the top. In addition, experienced boaters add a floating trip buoy so that the drogue can be deflated before recovery. The trip buoy line is a floating buoy attached to the top of the parachute cone which collapses the cone when pulled. In the case of series drogue lines, they are attached to the end of the line. Trip lines are especially helpful on series drogues because of their difficult recovery. Although the <b>trip</b> <b>line</b> concept is a derivative of the parachute sea anchor, evidence demonstrates that such a setup is not effective with the storm drogue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{engineering}} applications often {{benefit from}} collecting vehicle GPS traces in well-defined locations. As a motivating example, {{we will consider}} a traffic signal performance evaluation technique which requires GPS traces of vehicles traversing intersections. Since these applications do not require vehicle identity information, they are {{a good candidate for}} data de-identification techniques. Prior techniques can either provide data from specific locations or guarantee a high degree of anonymity under light traffic conditions but do not achieve both. In this paper, we propose a virtual <b>trip</b> <b>line</b> zone-aware path cloaking algorithm which combines these features. Zones where data should be retained can be predefined over the intersections of interest and the path cloaking algorithm uses entropy-estimates to decide whether the data can be revealed. Result obtained from a traffic simulator show that the application success rate increased from 39 to 82 % compared to a zone-unaware path cloaking algorithm, while achieving a similar degree of privacy.

40|$|Traffic {{monitoring}} using probe {{vehicles with}} GPS receivers promises {{significant improvements in}} cost, coverage, and accuracy over dedicated infrastructure systems. Current approaches, however, raise privacy concerns because they require participants to reveal their positions to an external traffic monitoring server. To address this challenge, we describe a system based on virtual trip lines and an associated cloaking technique, followed by another system design in which we relax the privacy requirements to maximize the accuracy of real-time traffic estimation. We introduce virtual trip lines which are geographic markers that indicate where vehicles should provide speed updates. These markers are placed to avoid specific privacy sensitive locations. They also allow aggregating and cloaking several location updates based on <b>trip</b> <b>line</b> identifiers, without knowing the actual geographic locations of these trip lines. Thus, they facilitate {{the design of a}} distributed architecture, in which no single entity has a complete knowledge of probe identities and fine-grained location information. We have implemented the system with GPS smartphone clients and conducted a controlled experiment with 100 phone-equipped drivers circling a highway segment, which was later extended into a year-long public deployment...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{systematic}} analysis of all dangerous N − 2 contingencies observed in medium size model of Polish power grid with about 2600 power lines. Each of the dangerous contingencies {{is composed of}} two initially <b>tripped</b> <b>lines</b> and one or more lines that overloaded as the result. There are 443 distinct contingencies that do not lead to immediate islanding of the grid. In {{the scope of the}} work we analyze the statistics of individual line participation in those contingencies and show that some lines have anomalously high rate of participation in the contingencies. Next, we show that about third of all the contingencies can be associated with the subgrids that are connected {{to the rest of the}} grid via small set of power line chains. The contingencies arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct contingencies. The rest of the contingencies are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N − 1 contingencies that result in heavy loading of particular <b>lines.</b> <b>Tripping</b> many different additional lines on top of these N − 1 contingencies results in an overload of one or more lines.

25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the <b>tripping</b> <b>line</b> may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|R

40|$|The {{interconnection}} of AC {{power systems}} surrounding a sea or {{a chain of}} mountains {{may lead to a}} structure having a ring shape. An example is the projected Mediterranean ring, planned to be operational within a few years. In the past, large circulating power flows of about 1000 MW were recorded in the ring power systems around the lake Erie and around the Rocky Mountains in North America. This paper shows that a stable power flow may circulate in a ring AC power system and corresponds to a total phase shift of 2 pi (or a multiple of 2 pi) radians along the ring. The various power flow solutions of a theoretical system are shown {{as a function of the}} power transfer between two areas. Simulations of the system dynamic behaviour show the presence of a loop flow due to a <b>line</b> <b>tripping.</b> The reclosure of the <b>tripped</b> <b>line</b> does not always restore the original power flow. The easiest way to get rid of it is to increase the equivalent impedance of a well-chosen path of the ring power system by opening one or several tie lines. The subsequent reclosure of these lines keeps the system in the normal state. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of synchrophasor technology into power distribution systems has given impetus to various monitoring, diagnostic, and control applications, such as system identification and event detection, which are crucial for restoring service, preventing outages, and managing equipment health. Drawing {{on the existing}} framework for inferring topology and admittances of a power network from voltage and current phasor measurements, this paper proposes an online algorithm for event detection and localization in unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. Using a convex relaxation and a matrix partitioning technique, the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying topology changes and attributing them to specific categories of events. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated on a standard test distribution feeder with synthesized loads, and it is shown that a <b>tripped</b> <b>line</b> can be detected and localized in an accurate and timely fashion, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.
