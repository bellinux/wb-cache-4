40|$|Low-Cost test methodologies for Systems-on-Chip are {{increasingly}} popular. They dictate which features {{have to be}} included on-chip and which test procedures have to be adopted in order to guarantee high test quality, while minimizing application costs. Consequently, Low-Cost test strategies can be run on testers offering lower performance and/or reduced features with respect to traditional Automatic Test Equipments (ATEs); these equipments are usually referred to as Low-Cost testers. This paper proposes a methodology for reducing the test data volume {{for the application of}} SoC Low-Cost test procedures. The method exploits a tester architecture organization suitable for SoCs testing, which includes a programmable device: the usage of this configurable block joined to the analysis of <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>regularities</b> permits minimizing the test data volume, thus improving the tester capabilities. The proposed method relies on test pattern compression at system level and it does not address core level pattern manipulation, as several other previously published works do. Case studies are proposed, which provide data about the application of the proposed methodology to the test of SoCs including self-testable processor and memory cores. IEEE 1149. 1 and IEEE 1500 test access mechanisms are considered. The achieved pattern depth reduction ratio is up to about the 64 % for the considered case studies. 1...|$|R

40|$|We are {{interested}} in building and maintaining semantic nets in general, and hierarchical semantic nets in particular. In [Mili, 1988], we developed a model of hierarchical semantic nets that generalizes taxonomic models by replacing the concept of property inheritance by a more general behavior of properties that we called regularity [Mili & Rada, 1990 a]. We are also interested in the generation of structured documents from hypertext. We argue that authors structure their descriptive documents based on personal but systematic traversals of {{a model of the}} domain of discourse [Mili & Rada, 1990 b]; when that model consists of a semantic net that exhibits regularity, the traversal can be rationalized and described concisely. Within the context of our research, we acquired an electronic copy of the Cyc knowledge base [Lenat & Guha, 1990] to: 1) use the semantic net underlying Cyc to support the generation of argumentative and explanatory documents, and 2) identify <b>regularity</b> <b>patterns.</b> Interestingly, the sheer size and richness of Cyc posed challenging performance problems to its designers, who had to constrain proof and inference procedures {{in such a way as}} to make it ill-adapted to the kind of open-ended lengthy logical inferences required for generation of argumentative text.

Within this paper we discuss extensions to our initial approach aimed at identifying possible update operations that caused the {{conflicts between}} the databases. This is done by restricting the items used for pattern mining. We further propose a classification of patterns based on mappings between the contradicting values to represent special cases of conflict generating updates. 1 Conflicts in Overlapping Databases Many databases exist with overlaps in their sets of represented real-world entities. There are different reasons for these overlaps, like: replication of data sources at different sites to improve the performance of web-services and the availability of the data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Every {{repetitive}} process encapsulates a <b>regularity</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{which may}} be expressed as an invariant assertion. Invariants embody implicit, insightful properties that characterize the execution of programming statements. Due to their implicit nature, invariants may be less apparent to algorithmic problem solvers. Yet, invariants are essential for designing correct and efficient algorithms. This paper illustrates the essential role of invariants, and examines whether novices tend to look for invariant properties during their algorithmic problem solving. The paper presents a study in which two novel algorithmic challenges were displayed {{to a group of}} motivated, novice students. Student solutions to these challenges demonstrate an operational reasoning approach, which does not capture the essence of the problems at hand, and yields non-satisfying results. Some solutions were incorrect, others were inefficient, and some had no convincing justification. These results, and the correct and efficient solutions to both challenges illuminate the importance of assertional reasoning and the fundamental role of invariants. Key words: invariants, algorithmic problem solving, operational reasoning, assertional reasoning. 1...|$|R

Using an orthographic <b>regularity</b> <b>pattern</b> elicitation paradigm, 536 Hong Kong Chinese children {{at different levels of}} reading (kindergarten, 2 nd, and 5 th grades) were asked to produce invented characters with left–right and top–bottom stroke pattern pairs.

This ability improved across grade level. Moreover, there was a production asymmetry in which children produced more top–bottom structured pseudocharacters than left–right structured pseudocharacters. The error pattern analysis further revealed that more positional errors were observed in producing left–right structured noncharacters than in the top–bottom structured noncharacters. This production asymmetry seemed to reflect children’s experience with a distribution asymmetry observed between left–right (59. 19 %) and top–bottom structured characters (23. 46 %) in a corpus of school Chinese.

We present in this paper the first dynamic routing algorithm in DTNs that exploits the most appropriate mobility property (among which node centrality and regularity) at the specific time and location. Our algorithm dynamically learns nodes mobility properties in order to appropriately select the best route to the destination on a per-node and per-situation basis.

Norms {{exist in the}} objective social environment {{in the form of}} behavioral <b>regularities,</b> <b>patterns</b> of sanctioning, and institutionalized practices and rules. They exist subjectively in perceived descriptive norms, perceived injunctive norms, and personal norms. We also distil and delineate three classic theories of why people adhere to norms: internalization, social identity, and rational choice. Additionally, we articulate an emerging theory of how perceived descriptive and injunctive norms function as two distinct navigational devices that guide thoughts and behavior in different ways, which we term “social autopilot” and “social radar. ” For each type of norms, we suggest how it may help to understand cultural dynamics at the micro level (the acquisition, variable influence and creative mutation of cultural knowledge) and the macro level (the transmission, diffusion and evolution of cultural practices). Having laid the groundwork for an integrated study of norm—normology, we then introduce the articles of this special issue contributing theoretical refinements and empirical evidence from different methods and levels of analysis.

Visual statistical learning was tested using a triplet learning paradigm in which participants had to detect and extract the temporal order of stimuli. Orthographic <b>regularity</b> learning was <b>tested</b> with an orthographic <b>regularity</b> <b>pattern</b> elicitation paradigm, in which {{participants were asked to}} invent orthographically legal pseudo-character with pairs of stroke patterns. A t-test comparison revealed that Chinese children with dyslexia had significantly poorer performance than controls in both orthographic regularity learning task and statistical learning task. Moreover, there was significant correlation between performance in orthographic regularity task and statistical learning task. For the first time, these results provide evidence that Chinese dyslexics have statistical learning difficulties, and such statistical learning deficit may be associated with their difficulties in orthographic regularity learning. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|R
