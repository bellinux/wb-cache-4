5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>that</b> this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

25|$|Echoing many of Ashby’s assertions in her 2007 paper {{entitled}} “Can Scottish {{public library}} services claim they are socially inclusive of all minority groups when lesbian fiction {{is still so}} inaccessible?”, Jaqueline Goldthorp outlines some of <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>that</b> lesbians face when trying to find lesbian fiction in Scottish libraries. She ties her study of lesbian literature {{to the importance of}} reading fiction on the psychological well-being of women, arguing that women often turn to fiction reading for self-affirmation and identity building. In addition, lesbian fiction titles can be priced up to 30% higher than non-lesbian titles, meaning that, for many low-income or working class lesbians, libraries are the only means of access for these titles Goldthorp surveyed 26 Scottish libraries and found that, in 2007, the majority had less than ten books labelled at “lesbian fiction,” and almost no recent award-winning titles. She suggests diversity training and education about methods and resources for providing service to lesbians for library staff as a way of promoting greater inclusion.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>that</b> remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E
