5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into observational and <b>theoretical</b> branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. <b>Theoretical</b> astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with <b>theoretical</b> astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm <b>theoretical</b> results.|$|E

5|$|Emil Julius Klaus Fuchs (29 December 1911– 28 January 1988) was a German <b>theoretical</b> {{physicist}} and atomic spy who, in 1950, {{was convicted of}} supplying information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after the Second World War. While at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant <b>theoretical</b> calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons, and later, early models of the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|He {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in <b>theoretical</b> physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea of considerable <b>theoretical</b> interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics. Phenomenology is the branch of <b>theoretical</b> physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract <b>theoretical</b> ideas. String phenomenology {{is the part of}} string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.|$|E

5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the <b>theoretical</b> basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this <b>theoretical</b> understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This <b>theoretical</b> analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness and reliability of the model.|$|E
5|$|Starting with a preface {{in which}} Berger {{explains}} how she first began studying the Wiccan and Pagan community of New England, Berger opens {{the main part}} of her book with a description of a Wiccaning which she attended. Proceeding to introduce both the Wiccan religion and her <b>theoretical</b> approach, Berger explains the British sociologist James A. Beckford's approach to the religions of late modernity as well as Anthony Giddens' <b>theoretical</b> approaches to modernism.|$|E
5|$|The <b>theoretical</b> thermal {{conductivity}} of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), {{which has the}} same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the <b>theoretical</b> calculations for graphene nanoribbons.

5|$|<b>Theoretical</b> {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of <b>theoretical</b> models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. <b>Theoretical</b> models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern <b>theoretical</b> studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E

25|$|<b>Theoretical</b> ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of ecological systems using <b>theoretical</b> methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, <b>theoretical</b> ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. <b>Theoretical</b> results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of <b>theoretical</b> methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.|$|E
