5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective for <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> and is currently available {{in some areas of}} the world.

5|$|Shorter hydroperiods of <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> {{promote the}} growth of periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud.

Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster {{the growth of}} specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gonzalo de Alvarado and his {{soldiers}} pushed south to meet Chávez. They were already exhausted from their previous expeditions; {{both men and}} horses were in poor shape, and supplies were a constant worry. Their progress was further hindered by {{the onset of the}} rain season, and the constant resistance of hostile natives. After <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> Gonzalo de Alvarado arrived at Lepaera, where they were expecting to find Chávez and his men. Unable to locate them, Alvarado sent out his lieutenant Xuárez de Ávila to scout the surrounding area. At length he returned with news that Chávez, faced with the threat of mutiny by his men, had marched back to Guatemala. Since Pedro de Alvarado had already left for Spain, this left Gonzalo as the highest-ranking Spanish officer in Honduras-Higueras.|$|E
30|$|The {{productivity}} {{increased as}} re-cropping years increasing, but the yield decreased obviously after 5 yrs re-cropping, this indicted that {{degradation of soil}} quality was occurred. The increase of fungus and bacteria number became main factors of soil degradation as re-cropping years increasing. The cropping models of cucumber and greengrocery, cucumber and cowpea showed significant higher cucumber yield, the second higher yield appeared in the cropping models between cucumber and maize for green manure, cucumber and tomato, cucumber and kidney bean. Therefore, that was effective method to use different cropping rotation models for decreasing number of microbe in soil, to prevent from soil degradation in greenhouse to fallow <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> to plant leguminous during summer season after winter-spring season cucumber harvested.|$|R

60|$|The cottages {{themselves}} are of several sorts, and some still {{exist in the}} earlier stages of mutation from the fishermen's and farmers' houses which formed their germ. But these are now mostly let as lodgings to bachelors and other single or semi-detached folks who go for their meals to the neighboring hotels or boarding-houses. The hotels are each the centre {{of this sort of}} centripetal life, as well as the homes of their own scores or hundreds of inmates. A single boarding-house gathers about it half a dozen dependent cottages which it cares for, and feeds at its table; and even where the cottages have kitchens and all the housekeeping facilities, their inmates sometimes prefer to dine at the hotels. By far the greater number of cottagers, however, keep house, bringing their service with them from the cities, and settling in their summer homes for <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>or</b> five <b>months.</b>|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting some {{deviations from the}} standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. Sputum culture positive patients who are smear negative {{at the start of}} treatment do well with only 4 months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); and sputum culture negative patients do well on only 3 months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for only <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months,</b> but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be re-assuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.|$|E
25|$|Allied forces {{begin to}} take large numbers of Axis prisoners: The total number of prisoners taken on the Western Front in April 1945 by the Western Allies was 1,500,000.

In the <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months</b> up to the end of April, over 800,000 German soldiers surrendered on the Eastern Front. In early April, the first Allied-governed Rheinwiesenlagers were established in western Germany to hold hundreds of thousands of captured or surrendered Axis Forces personnel. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) reclassified all prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces, not POWs (prisoners of war). The legal fiction circumvented provisions under the Geneva Convention of 1929 on the treatment of former combatants. By October, thousands had died in the camps from starvation, exposure and disease.|$|E
25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} every two, <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, {{and then move on}} to more advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as they may not have the required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the use of {{temporary}} external fixation within the perspective of a damage control orthopedics attitude in the management of battlefield extremity injuries. HypothesisDamage control orthopaedics (DCO) is a valuable treatment option for easy and rapid limb fracture stabilization in an unfavorable surgical environment. MethodsSixteen French soldiers wounded on the battlefield between 2004 and 2009 and managed by damage control orthopedics were included in this retrospective series. All patients were males with a mean age of 30 years (20 – 53 years). Eighteen external fixators were applied on the theater of operations for multiple injuries (five cases), closed fractures of the pelvis <b>or</b> long bones (<b>three</b> cases) and open osteoarticular lesions (ten cases). ResultsAfter medical evacuation from original theater, conversion to internal fixation was possible in five cases. External fixation was maintained in thirteen cases due to the severity of the lesions or infectious complications. Bone union was achieved in all cases. The mean time for bone union was 2. 8 months (2 to 3 months) in case of conversion to internal fixation, and 6. 3 months (1. 5 to 17 months) when external fixation was extended. To achieve bone union, three devices were removed after a <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> period and converted to rigid internal fixation associated with bone grafting. No case of septic complication was observed after early conversion. The only case of post-conversion infection occurred after three months of external fixation. After a mean follow-up of 19 months (6 to 49 months) all patients recovered functional autonomy and thirteen could return to duty. ConclusionWhen possible, early conversion from external to internal fixation improves bone union and functional recovery after war limb injuries in properly selected patients.
