25|$|Germany and the Soviet Union {{entered an}} {{intricate}} trade pact on February 11, 1940 {{that was over}} four {{times larger than the}} one the two countries had signed in August 1939. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories, and this allowed Nazi Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship Bismarck, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the Me-109 fighter, Me-110 fighter and Ju-88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of Germany artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items. The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk. This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a <b>takeoff</b> <b>point</b> for raids and attacks on shipping.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a record}} of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being {{discovered}} {{in the nineteenth century}} but the artifact has since been lost.

2500|$|There are {{problems}} on both extremes {{of the gun}} transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as [...] "fire medicine," [...] the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes {{before the arrival of}} the gun. However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory and the questions they raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the Battle of Talas as perhaps a possible <b>takeoff</b> <b>point</b> for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that [...] "there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China." [...] A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come to is that the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{inertial}} {{upper stage}} (IUS) {{for the space}} shuttle operation employs solid rocket stages with fixed, propellant loadings. This means that, if for a given mission the satellite weight {{is less than the}} maximum, the IUS will deliver higher delta V's than required. One way to waste the excess capability in order to achieve the desired orbit would be to execute a nonoptimal transfer which would require higher than maximum delta V's. An algorithm is presented which defines <b>takeoff</b> <b>points</b> on the parking orbit and the injection points on the orbit for which transfer orbits require a fixed delta V sub 1 and a fixed delta V sub 2 (defined by the satellite weight). It is assumed that both the parking and the target orbit are elliptical. This allows the use of the same algorithm for guidance. The transfer orbit achieved by the erroneous delta V sub 1 is regarded as a new parking orbit and the new transfer problem is solved by assuming a delta, delta V sub 1. The maximum value of delta, delta V sub 1 is the delta V sub 1 variation and its minimum value is the one which still yields a solution by the algorithm. The delta V sub errors are regarded as orbit injection errors and compensated in the usual way...|$|R

500|$|Since it was {{no longer}} {{possible}} to abort the <b>takeoff</b> at this <b>point,</b> the crew followed the standard operating procedure for an [...] "engine out" [...] climb. This procedure is to climb at the takeoff safety airspeed (V2) and attitude (angle), as directed by the flight director. The partial electrical power failure (produced by the separation of the left No. 1 engine) meant that neither the stall warning nor slat retraction indicator was operative. The crew was, therefore, unaware that the slats on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing. Thus flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift, so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left. Later, in simulator recreations of the accident, it was determined that by climbing at a higher airspeed the crash could have been averted.|$|R

We develop a theory to understand global takeoff for digital wireless phones that can be extended to other technologies with related characteristics. Drawing on technology dominance and product life cycle theories, we build a model that consists of standards, market competition, technology costs, and technology substitution to explain takeoff and subsequent market penetration growth. The data are from 41 developed and developing countries. The results suggest that the presence and effects of standards {{play an important role in}} driving takeoff and penetration growth. Familiarity with wireless phones and an installed base of analog phone technologies also explain faster takeoff times. Non-price factors are important drivers of penetration growth after takeoff as well. Our results have managerial and policy implications on innovative strategies, standards and competition policy settings for digital wireless phones...|$|R
