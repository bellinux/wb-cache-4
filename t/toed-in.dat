Harry had pounded away all the week on Webster's reply to Hayne, and he now stood forth in piteous {{contrast}} to his ponderous theme. His thin, shaking legs <b>toed-in</b> like an Indian's, and his trousers were tight, and short, and checked, which seemed to increase the tightness and shortness. He had narrow shoulders and thin, long arms, which he used like a jumping jack, each gesture being curiously unrelated to his facial expression, which was mainly appealing and apprehensive. As Shep Watson said, [...] "He {{looked as if he}} expected a barn to fall on him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rail fins are {{typically}} [...] "toed-in," [...] that is, {{the leading edge}} of the fins are oriented toward the centerline of the surfboard, which decreases the angle of attack in trim, which makes it easier to initiate turns. [...] "Toeing in" [...] rail fins also adds drag on the [...] "outside" [...] fin, as its angle of attack is negative during trim or in a turn. These combined factors of <b>toed-in</b> rail fins cause several issues: drag on a <b>toed-in</b> outside rail fin can slow the board down in trim, but it can also give a braking effect during turns that is useful. The inside rail fin (and the board itself) can be [...] "pumped," [...] attacked and re-attacked, by swerving up and down the face, causing acceleration down the line, or similarly pumped to achieve a desired trajectory through a multi-stage turn. At higher speeds, the drag off <b>toed-in</b> rail fins can cause surfboards to oscillate and become unstable - a phenomenon known as [...] "speed wobbles".|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} setup, the [...] "thruster" [...] is a tri-fin. All the fins {{are the same}} size, with two semi-parallel ({{slightly}} <b>toed-in,</b> usually, and slightly canted outward, usually) fins mounted near the rails 10-12 inches forward of the tail and a middle fin at 3-5 inches.|$|E
50|$|New {{designs are}} drawn using 3D cad software. From the 3D design, {{two-dimensional}} flat sections are created {{to become the}} precision-cut frames (internal Rib-like structures perpendicular to the mid-line from nose to tail) and keel (known as stringer in a foam surfboard). Then bookmatched wood is selected that blends {{together to form a}} unique pattern on the deck and bottom of the board. The keel and frames are then drilled with holes to further reduce the weight. The constructed frames and keel define the overall shape and size of the board. The installation of fins and fin-boxes (for removable fins) is aided by a builder's laser to ensure that fins are placed, canted and <b>toed-in</b> symmetrically. The hollow and watertight nature of these boards require the installation of a vent plug to equalize internal and external pressure that changes due to temperature variation and to changes in atmospheric pressure which, without the vent, would cause air pressure inside the board to increase.|$|E
40|$|Stereo {{cameras are}} the basic tools used to obtain {{stereoscopic}} image pairs, {{which can lead to}} truly great image quality. However, some inappropriate shooting conditions may cause discomfort while viewing stereo images. It is therefore considerably necessary to establish the perceptual criteria {{that can be used to}} evaluate the shooting quality of stereo cameras. This article proposes objective quality evaluation criteria based on the characteristics of parallel and <b>toed-in</b> camera configurations. Considering the different internal structures and basic shooting principles, this paper focuses on short-distance shooting conditions and establishes assessment criteria for both parallel and <b>toed-in</b> camera configurations. Experimental results show that the proposed evaluation criteria can predict the visual perception of stereoscopic images and effectively evaluate stereoscopic image quality...|$|E

Projected images from optical modules could be distorted by <b>toed-in</b> configuration of array; we analyzed this relationship by using homography matrix. To verify our method, we designed zigzag configuration of multi-projectors and applied our proposed method. Experimental {{results will be}} provided to verify the proposed method.

Multiple video plus depth data from different camera views are available. “Book arrival” sequence is captured by a parallel camera array {{and the others are}} obtained by a <b>toed-in</b> camera array. The baseline between two adjacent cameras is approximately 6.5 cm for “Book arrival” sequence and 20 cm for the other two sequences.|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} be written {{within the scope}} of the course TEL- 7403 summer 1995 under the {{direction}} of Prof. Janusz Konrad, my director of research. The main aim of this work is to lay out useful geometric models for further study in stereoscopic video processing. The fundamental concepts in stereoscopic processing are reviewed in company with geometric models. We try describe the concerned problems not only by giving simply a definition but also by giving a mathematical analysis. Another aim is to develop a technique to eliminate vertical parallax {{due to the fact that}} the sensor planes are not parallel in a <b>toed-in</b> camera setup. Finally some stereoscopic properties of human visual system are mentioned. i Content...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{element of}} stereoscopic image production is to geometrically analyze the conversion from real space to stereoscopic images by binocular parallax under various shooting and viewing conditions. This paper reports on this analysis, {{particularly on the}} setting of the optical axes of 3 D cameras, which has received little attention in the past. The parallel camera configuration maintains linearity during the conversion from real space to stereoscopic images. But the <b>toed-in</b> camera configuration often can not maintain linearity during the conversion from real space to stereoscopic images. 3 D cameras (see Fig. 1) [7]. As the demand for efficient program production increases, {{it is very important to}} precisely understand the characteristics of these two ways of placing optical axes and to use them flexibly depending on the situation. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the origins, characteristics {{and effects of}} image distortions in stereoscopic video systems. The geometry of stereoscopic camera and display systems is presented first. This {{is followed by the}} analysis and diagrammatic presentation of various image distortions such as depth plane curvature, depth non-linearity, depth and size magnification, shearing distortion and keystone distortion. The variation of system parameters is also analysed with the help of plots of image geometry to show their effects on image distortions. The converged (<b>toed-in)</b> and parallel camera configurations are compared and the amount of vertical parallax induced by lens distortion and keystone distortion are discussed. The range of acceptable vertical parallax and the convergence/accommodation limitations on depth range are also discussed. It is shown that a number of these distortions can be eliminated by the appropriate choice of camera and display system parameters. There are some image distortions, however, which cannot be avoided {{due to the nature of}} human vision and limitations of current stereoscopic video display techniques. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop an innovative technology framework that allows a new type of human-computer interaction, where user's motion recognition is combined with immersive visualisation. The demonstrator program allows the user to visualise a virtual arrow {{on the top of a}} real physical crossbow used as game controller. Stereoscopic- 3 D Visualisation is implemented using two virtual cameras with a variable angle between them (Automated <b>Toed-in).</b> An algorithm is also used to calculate the maximum acceptable dimension of the stereoscopic arrow, in relation with the screen size and the data provided by the Motion Capture system about the user position. The Motion Capture data are transmitted to the video game using a network interface demanded also to depacketize and process the motion data. Tests prove that the Stereoscopic- 3 D effect is strong enough to visualise the virtual arrow in a realistic position on the top of the crossbow. The theory formulated may be utilised to develop a new generation of Stereoscopic applications easy to use and immersive...|$|E
40|$|The {{conformation}} of {{the limbs}} of foals, future athletes, {{has become the}} focus of attention of physicians and breeders in the last 20 years due to the contribution of a poor conformation to a higher incidence of musculoskeletal disorders and consequently greater economic recovery of individuals with correct angulations. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the main angulation disorders of Crioulo foals from the first to the eighth month of life, highlighting those that are the most frequent. A total of 77 foals of the 2007 generation were evaluated, they were chosen by a process of simple random sampling of a total of 164 foals raised on the properties analyzed. The study was conducted in two stages, the first evaluation was performed with animals within 1 and 4 months of age and the second with the same foals aged 5 and 8 months. Considering the two evaluations, the main angular defect observed was <b>toed-in,</b> which was observed in 47 foals. The identification of defects in angulations after birth or its appearance is extremely important to the veterinary, allowing immediate intervention by performing trimming and/or changes in management or surgery for correction of angular deviation...|$|E
