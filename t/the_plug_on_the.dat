5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about the gazebo, and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges into the shape of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights, but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the TV program Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters premiered on NBC. In {{addition}} to hosts Barbara, Louise, and Irlene, the show featured musical guests and comedy sketches. Each broadcast also {{closed with a}} gospel song, which led to Mandrell recording her own inspirational album, He Set My Life to Music (1982). As {{a result of her}} busy schedule, she began suffering from vocal strain, and on doctor's orders, pulled <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television program in 1982. (Variety shows were also falling out of favor at the time; the series was NBC's last variety series to date.) She received one award (People's Choice) and two nominations (Golden Globe and TV Land Award) for her work on the show. In 1983, she premiered The Lady Is a Champ, a Las Vegas stage show.|$|E
25|$|At New Hampshire for the Camping World RV Sales 301, Johnson {{qualified}} second, {{but failed}} post-qualifying inspection after {{his car was}} found to be too low, and started the race in 43rd, {{the first time in his}} career he started dead last. In the race, Johnson passed seven cars in the first four laps and reached the Top 20 by lap 50, while reaching the top ten by lap 165; Johnson would finish sixth. He almost won the pole position at Indianapolis but was bumped to second by Ryan Newman. Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right front tire that knocked a spark plug loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.|$|E
50|$|The AtariLab {{hardware}} consisted {{largely of}} a single circuit board that broke out the pins in the Atari joystick port into RCA jacks.

25|$|In 1983, Scorsese {{began work}} on a long-cherished {{personal}} project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.|$|E
500|$|In April 1969 Davies helped {{negotiate}} {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, {{which allowed}} plans for a North American tour. Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset.

2500|$|On January 8, 1979 NBC moved Jeopardy! from 10:30a.m. to noon, {{the time}} slot the {{original}} series had occupied and {{done well in}} for many years. However, the television climate in 1979 was much different {{than it was in}} the 1960s and early 1970s. The 12:00p.m. hour was one that network affiliates often chose to pre-empt in favor of showing other programming such as a midday local newscast or a syndicated offering such as another game show or a talk show. In markets that did air Jeopardy! at noon, the show found itself losing the ratings battle against The $20,000 Pyramid on ABC and The Young and the Restless on CBS. NBC decided to pull <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> revived Jeopardy! series shortly after the move, and its 108th and final episode aired on March 2, 1979. Its place on the schedule was taken by Password Plus, which at the time had been airing at 12:30p.m., and the cancellation allowed NBC to expand their top rated soap opera, Another World, to ninety minutes from sixty.|$|E
2500|$|During 1977 and 1978, Rundgren {{attempted}} to tour with a true quadraphonic sound system, however it proved ultimately unworkable – despite successfully delivering high-quality sound in a concert setting – {{due to the}} enormous technical requirements involved. Since most concert arenas of the day were ill-equipped to host large towers of sound equipment {{in the rear of}} the halls, the speakers often had to be hung from the ceiling rigging. This installation could take up to two days to complete, meaning that it was necessary to send two separate sound systems, each with its own, complete set-up crew, out on the road, so that they could [...] "leapfrog" [...] and allow Rundgren to play dates on consecutive days, which would have otherwise been impossible. The system featured a then-new technology called [...] "signal analysis", which required white and pink noise to be pumped through the speakers, in order to set the active equalizers so as to minimize feedback and distortion. The pink and white noise analysis had to be performed twice: once with the hall empty, and then again with the audience present, which many concertgoers found annoying. Additionally, Rundgren's insistence on personally overseeing the acoustic set-up of the system left him exhausted and unable to continue, and he pulled <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> experiment.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{creeping}} motion of plugs of negligible viscosity in rough capillary tubes filled with carrier fluids. This extends Bretherton's research work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> infinite-length bubble motion in a cylindrical or smooth tube for small capillary numbers Ca. We first derive the asymptotic dependence of <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> speed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> finite length in the smooth tube case. This dependence on length is exponentially small, with a decay length much {{shorter than the}} tube radius R. Then we discuss the effect of azimuthal roughness of <b>the</b> tube <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> speed. <b>The</b> tube roughness leads to an unbalanced capillary pressure and a carrier fluid flux in the azimuthal plane. This flux controls the relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> shape to its infinite-length limit. For long-wavelength roughness, {{we find that the}} above decay length is much longer in the rough tube, and even becomes comparable to the tube radius R in some cases. This implies a much-enhanced dependence of <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> speed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> length. This mechanism may explain the catch-up effect seen experimentally.
