5000|$|Visual art was {{considered}} one of the most important aspects of anarchist activity from the birth of anarchism, with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon writing on his friend and contemporary Gustav Courbet in the essay Du Principe de l’art, published 1865, that ‘The task of art is <b>to</b> warn <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> praise <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> teach <b>us,</b> <b>to</b> make <b>us</b> blush by confronting us with the mirror of our own conscience.’ Courbet also went on to paint Proudhon on several occasions.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. The portion of New England Route 14 from Barre to Burlington was assigned <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 2, while the portion in New Hampshire was assigned <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 4. This shortened Route 14 in the south <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 2 in the city of Barre. In 1935, the portion of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18. The old US 2 alignment was redesignated as US 302. VT 14 was extended northward several miles to East Montpelier, ending at the junction of newly relocated US 2 and Vermont Route 12.|$|E
