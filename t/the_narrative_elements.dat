In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily {{the most exciting thing}} now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> of {{the ceiling}} {{illustrate}} that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components {{of the ceiling}} are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E
500|$|The {{text that}} Tippett {{prepared}} follows the three-part structure used in Handel's Messiah, in which Part I is prophetic and preparatory, Part II narrative and epic, Part III meditative and metaphysical. In A Child of Our Time the general condition of oppression {{is defined in}} the first part, <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> are confined to the second part, while the third part contains interpretation and reflection on a possible healing. [...] Tippett perceived the work as a general depiction of man's inhumanity to man, and wanted Grynszpan's tragedy [...] to stand for the oppressed everywhere. To preserve the universality of the work, Tippett avoids all use of proper names for people and places: thus, Paris is [...] "a great city", Grynszpan becomes [...] "the boy", the soprano is [...] "the boy's mother", vom Rath is [...] "the official".|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} Nicky Wire {{said that he}} wanted Kieran Evans for the video. The band tried to continue <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> that <b>the</b> two previous singles from Rewind the Film had.

500|$|A {{composer}} {{may also}} {{respond to a}} text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This {{is evident in the}} unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the [...] "Queen Mab Scherzo" [...] – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, [...] "as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [...] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|A core {{element of}} F.E.A.R. is its horror theme, which is heavily {{inspired}} by Japanese horror. The design team attempted to keep [...] " [...] {{psychology of the}} encounter" [...] in the player's mind at all times, in order to [...] "get under [...] skin", {{as opposed to the}} [...] "in your face 'monsters jumping out of closets' approach". Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that [...] "horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity". He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> of F.E.A.R., to give players [...] "enough clues so that [...] can form [...] own theories about what's going on, but ideally [...] be left with some uncertainty". Lead level designer John Mulkey stated, [...] "Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important, predictability ruins a scary mood".|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements.</b> But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E

5000|$|Ivo has [...] "poems in prose" [...] {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> is totally subordinated to lyricism, the {{evolution}} of mood, the expression of emotions and passions, and to language and style in Ceznja (Longing, 1898). The same kind of lyrical prose was produced by the eight years younger Isidora Sekulić in Bure (Gusts).|$|R
50|$|The hymns, {{which must}} be {{the remains of a}} once more {{strongly}} represented genre, vary widely in length, some being as brief as three or four lines, while others are in excess of five hundred lines. The long ones comprise an invocation, praise, and narrative, sometimes quite extended. In the briefest ones, <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> is lacking. <b>The</b> longer ones show signs of having been assembled from pre-existing disparate materials.|$|R

50|$|While the {{thematic}} arrangement {{may reflect the}} unfolding of real or fictional events, the sonnet cycle is very rarely narrative; <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> may be inferred, but provide background structure, and are never the primary concern of the poet's art.|$|E

We report this review work in this paper, first explaining how we found and selected our material and then presenting our thematic analysis of it...|$|R
500|$|Like many of Lichtenstein's works {{its title}} {{comes from the}} speech balloon in the painting. The work was {{included}} in Lichtenstein's second solo exhibition. The source of the image is a comic book from DC Comics. Lichtenstein has made significant alterations to the original image to change the focus and perspective in addition to significant alteration [...] of <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> work. The work plays on the background-foreground relationship and the theme of vision that appears in many of Lichtenstein's works.|$|R
5000|$|Internet genre {{refers to}} a type of genre ( [...] or [...] ) {{explored}} in multimedia Studies. Others include film genre, video game genres and music genre.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on " 1001 Nights Now", a play staged in Britain in 2005, dramatizing the {{experience}} of Muslim refugees and asylum seekers, {{in the aftermath of}} 9 / 11. The article argues that by foregrounding <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> as a strategy for survival and by bringing together echoes and features of diverse cultures, the play recreates a disporic/translational space on the stage and contributes to the conceptualization of intercultural theatre as posited "at the crossroads of cultures", according to P. Pavis (1992) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> in Bossuet's sermons grew shorter {{with each}} year. He never drew satirical {{pictures}} like his great rival Louis Bourdaloue. He would not write out his discourses in full, much less learn them off by heart: {{of the two}} hundred printed in his works, all but a fraction are rough drafts. Ladies such as Mme de Sévigné forsook him when Bourdaloue dawned on the Paris horizon in 1669, though Fénelon and La Bruyère, two much sounder critics, refused to follow their example.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} {{elements}} to the gameplay of Houkago no Love Beat. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> involves <b>the</b> main character having conversations with other characters, making choices that affect the storyline. The 'live part' is a minigame where the player uses the PS2 controller to affect {{the performance of the}} band during various songs. If the player does a good job, the song is performed well, and if the player misses a lot of cues, the band performs badly. This in turn affects how well the band is received, whether they get a contract, etc.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, Miodrag Popović {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> of secrecy and stratagem in the Serbian tradition were all introduced from Turkish sources, seeking to defame {{the capabilities of}} their Christian opponents by attributing {{the death of the}} Murat to [...] "devious" [...] methods. Thomas A. Emmert agrees with him.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{to serve as a}} supporting document for the exhibition Word Birds that was held at the Render Gallery at the University of Waterloo, April 22 - 27, 2008. The drawing and sculpture in this exhibition attempt to address the complex relationship humans have with animals and the ways we have charged them with symbolic and anthropomorphic characteristics. The work examines the human tendency to observe, name, and ascribe meaning to animals and speaks to the connection between natural history and human nature. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> work is derived {{from a variety of sources}} including observation, philosophical speculation, and literary sources...|$|R
40|$|STORYLINE {{comprises}} {{works by}} seven artists {{that deal with}} narration and transformation. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element,</b> where stories {{are not so much}} told as indicated, unfolds itself through drawing. As the exhibition shows, drawing is a versatile practice to which each of the works has a different approach. In this context drawing should be understood broadly, and thus many of the works shown at the exhibition are the result of the artist’s use of mixed media.

40|$|Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) {{provides}} a framework for analyzing how policy <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> can influence an individual’s policy preference {{in a manner that}} adheres to traditional scientific standards. At the micro-level, NPF is nascent in empirically testing whether specific <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> have an effect in influencing individual opinion formation. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> of causal mechanism, which is embedded in policy narratives to assign responsibility and blame, is an important element that has not yet been examined. This study utilizes an experimental design to analyze which specific type of causal mechanism has a greater influence on individual opinion. As a treatment, four policy narratives were developed based on the two opposing policy preferences expressed in public comments pertaining to a controversial land use issue in Montana. For each policy preferences two narratives were developed; one with an inadvertent and another with an intentional casual mechanism. A survey pre-test measured the dependent variables of policy opinion, while controlling for policy preference, general knowledge, and political ideology. A control narrative was also employed. After exposure to one of the five randomly assigned policy narratives, a post-test was administered to determine changes in policy opinion. A probability sample of college students was employed, with n= 778. Both paired t-tests and regression analyses reveal that the intentional casual mechanism has the ability to strongly influence an individual policy preference. The inadvertent causal mechanism influences those who initially hold an opposing policy preference than the one presented in <b>the</b> <b>narrative.</b> <b>The</b> importance of this study for public administrators is that it further illuminates <b>the</b> influence that <b>narrative</b> <b>elements,</b> specifically causal mechanisms, can have on influencing individual opinion...|$|R
50|$|The Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events, {{based on}} the book series of the same name written by Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket, {{incorporates}} some of <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> from the books by having Lemony Snickets as a narrator character (played by Patrick Warburton) speaking directly to the television viewer that frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain various literary wordplay that was included in the books.|$|E
5000|$|Kuningas Lear was {{commissioned}} by and first performed by Finnish National Opera on 15 September 2000 at the Finnish National Opera House. Sallinen has spoken of the major thought that went into recreating the dramaturgy of the piece, shortening sections and deleting characters from the cast. His aim was in general to remove {{as much as possible}} of <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> and mainly concentrate on the [...] "very strong poetical scenes". He insisted that the work requires [...] "big singing".|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} by reducing <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>elements</b> {{and focusing on}} the magic.

5000|$|There was {{a revival}} of the Yamato-e style in the 15th century by the Tosa school, {{including}} a return to narrative subjects, and although the rival Kanō school grew out of the alternative tradition of Chinese-style works, the style it developed from the late 16th century for large paintings decorating Japanese castles included some elements of the Yamato-e style. In the 17th century, the simplified and stylised depiction of landscape backgrounds in Yamato-e was revived as a style for large landscape works by the Rinpa school (...) [...] Later <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> of Yamato-e, <b>the</b> interest in the depiction of everyday life, and the choice of oblique and partial views in a composition heavily influenced the ukiyo-e (...) style, as well as the Nihonga (...)

500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks through a hole in <b>the</b> door. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>element</b> of <b>the</b> image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See the Whole Room and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Joseph Melillo, {{director}} of the Brooklyn Academy of Music produced a stage show called Songs from the Capeman using Paul Simon's Capeman music without <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> dramatic <b>elements</b> of <b>the</b> show.
