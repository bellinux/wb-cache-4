5|$|After the World Cup, Taylor was disheartened by {{both her}} own, and England's, lack of success. She bemoaned that <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> {{she had made}} had come to nothing, and after talking to psychologists, she {{realised}} {{that she needed to}} readdress her work–life balance. An amateur violinist, she was accepted into the Reading Orchestra, and by early 2006 was working out of the University of Reading as a performance management consultant.|$|E

5000|$|The Eucharist is {{a renewal}} of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> on <b>the</b> cross. Christ is <b>the</b> Priest, <b>the</b> <b>Sacrifice</b> and <b>the</b> Purpose of <b>the</b> Eucharistic <b>sacrifice.</b> <b>The</b> {{faithful}} should participate {{but they do not}} have priestly authority.

5|$|In {{the world}} of Hibiki's Magic, {{in order to gain}} magic one must make a sacrifice.

Hibiki tries to help by making <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> a little more bearable.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{traveled}} to New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., {{to speak out}} in favor of women's voting rights. She described her actions during and after the Civil War, and used <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> of countless women throughout modern history as evidence of women's equality to men. When the National Federation of Afro-American Women was founded in 1896, Tubman was the keynote speaker at its first meeting.|$|E
5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> this may entail.|$|E
60|$|Think {{of these}} things, my friends, always, but, above all, {{think of them}} as often as you come--as would to God all would come--to the altar of the Lord, and the Holy Communion of His body and blood. For there, indeed, you render to God that which is God's--namely, yourselves; there you offer to God <b>the</b> true <b>sacrifice,</b> which is <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of yourselves-- <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of repentance, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of thanksgiving, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of righteousness, or at least of hunger and thirst after righteousness; and there you receive in return your share of God's <b>sacrifice,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> which you did not make for Him, but which He made for you, when He spared not His only-begotten Son but freely gave Him for us.|$|R

5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At the same time as <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|Allingham was {{the oldest}} ever {{surviving}} member {{of any of the}} British Armed Forces and one of the oldest surviving veterans of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force (RAF). In 2001 he became the face of the First World War veterans' association and made frequent public appearances to ensure that awareness of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> of the First World War was not lost to modern generations. He received many honours and awards for his First World War service and his longevity.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E

50|$|Like many of {{her other}} pieces, Offertorium {{contains}} religious elements. Even the name is a reference to that section of a Mass (performed immediately after the Credo) that is sung while the priest is offering up the prepared bread and wine. The work takes as its overarching theme <b>the</b> concepts of <b>sacrifice</b> and offering: <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Christ during the Crucifixion, God’s offering in creating <b>the</b> Earth, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> performer to <b>the</b> tone, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> composer to the art, and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> main musical theme to disintegration and, later, reconstruction.|$|R

5|$|Further into chapter 4, Odin {{appoints}} Njörðr and Freyr as {{priests of}} sacrificial offerings, {{and they became}} gods among the Æsir. Freyja is introduced as a daughter of Njörðr, and as the priestess at <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices.</b> In the saga, Njörðr is described as having once wed his unnamed sister {{while he was still}} among the Vanir, and the couple produced their children Freyr and Freyja from this union, though this custom was forbidden among the Æsir.|$|E
5|$|In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, {{the author}} claims that Allingham planned {{to leave his}} body to medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to remind people of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows the prelude and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} youth to answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> which they made. In this, the work is not displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we seek to}} {{estimate}} <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> ratio of <b>the</b> euro area using a small DSGE model where prices and wages are sticky. We estimate model's parameters so as to minimize the distance between VAR-based and model-based covariances {{of a set of}} variables. The estimated value of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> ratio reaches 1. 30 %. In a second step, we proceed to a set of counterfactual exercises in order to highlight the link between <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> ratio and <b>the</b> degree of prices and wages stickiness. We obtain that a decrease of prices stickiness does not necessary result in a decrease of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> ratio. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> ratio rises with the degree of wage stickiness. Sacrifice ratio; Sticky prices and sticky wages; DSGE model. ...|$|R

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making {{the sign of the cross}} during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{advisers}} and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius; even his soothsayers recommended against it, stating that <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> had produced unfavorable omens. Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some {{to believe that}} he had some form of supernatural guidance, ignored all these cautions. Early in the spring of 312AD, Constantine crossed the Cottian Alps with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000. The first town his army encountered was Segusium (Susa, Italy), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly. Constantine ordered his troops not to loot the town, and advanced with them into northern Italy.|$|E
5000|$|The Eucharist is a {{sacrifice}} {{in that it}} re-presents (makes present again) <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> cross. <b>The</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Christ and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> Eucharist are one single sacrifice. Christ, of course, is not <b>sacrificed</b> again because <b>the</b> one <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> Cross was accomplished [...] "once for all" [...] and cannot be repeated. The Mass is a liturgical representation of {{a sacrifice}} that makes present what it represents through the action of God in an unbloody manner. The Eucharist {{is not merely a}} commemoration of Christ's sacrifice on Golgotha: it also makes that <b>sacrifice</b> truly present. <b>The</b> priest and victim of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> {{are one and the same}} (Christ), with the difference that the Eucharist is offered in an unbloody manner.|$|R

500|$|Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be [...] "a {{fertility}} cult", she {{asserted that}} many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of <b>sacrifice</b> performed by <b>the</b> witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of animals, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers, and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of <b>the</b> witches' god by fire to ensure fertility.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, {{changes in}} post-war {{politics}} impacted considerably on the memorials. in Belgium, the Flemish IJzertoren tower had become associated with Fascism during the Second World War and was blown up in 1946 by anti-Flemish activists, leading to outrage. Proposals were put forward {{to build a}} national monument on the site, but ultimately a second Flemish memorial was constructed instead. In Romania, the Communist post-war government moved away from commemorations around Ascension Day, which was seen as carrying too many religious meanings. The Romanian Societata itself was abolished in 1948, pilgrimages to the memorials ceased and {{the focus of the}} Communist government was almost entirely placed on commemorating <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> of the Soviet army during World War II. Unusually, political changes in Canada led to the construction of new World War I memorials; some of the inter-war tensions eased, and 35 new memorials were added in Quebec to the existing 68 in the post-war years, often built as combined memorials to later conflicts.|$|E
5|$|German {{scholar and}} folklorist Wilhelm Mannhardt {{holds that the}} log {{represented}} an incarnation {{of the spirit of}} vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>sacrifices</b> offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting of the log could be regarded as a fusion of tree worship and fire worship, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., Istrians fed the logs lighted on St. John's Day by sprinkling wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with Attis, Osiris, Adonis, and Sandan. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of the log may have originated from idols representing deities comparable with the Roman Lares, the cruciform having developed from an anthropomorphic shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god Perun.|$|E
5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India {{about the need for}} an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for <b>the</b> <b>sacrifices</b> of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.|$|E
