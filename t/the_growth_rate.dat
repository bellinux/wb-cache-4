40|$|Using an {{electron}} distribution function {{measured in the}} auroral zone, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of both ordinary and Z-mode radiation are calculated via the cyclotron maser mechanism. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of Z-mode radiation are much {{more sensitive to the}} background plasma density than those of ordinary mode radiation, which are essentially constant over a wide range of the ratio of the background electron plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency. In very low density regions, Z-mode waves are dominant over the ordinary mode, but as the ratio of the electron plasma frequency over the gyrofrequency increases, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of Z-mode are substantially reduced, leading to an eventual dominance of the ordinary mode over the Z-mode.

5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I.

5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines.

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups.

Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E

5|$|Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this {{represents}} an underestimate {{of the true}} number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, {{but the lack of}} the external fundamental system (a series of tightly-spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{longitudinal}} ventilation velocity enhances the heat transfer from hot gases to fuel and then {{results in an}} increase of <b>the</b> fire <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> in a tunnel fire.

30|$|A {{common mistake}} in {{macroeconomic}} analysis that may potentially lead to misguided policies is to confuse demand factors {{of economic growth}} with supply factors. As far as <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> is concerned, demand factors can only influence <b>the</b> difference, i.e., <b>growth</b> gap, between <b>the</b> real <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> <b>rate.</b> A strong short-term demand can push <b>the</b> real <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> beyond potential <b>growth</b> capacity, while inadequate demand can cause real growth to fall short of potential <b>growth</b> capacity. However, <b>the</b> potential of economic growth ultimately depends on <b>the</b> potential <b>growth</b> <b>rate,</b> which is constrained by production factors {{on one hand and}} TFP on the other.

Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone {{histology}} can determine the age of a specimen when it died.

Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults.
