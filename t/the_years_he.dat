5|$|The {{loss of his}} son was a major blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically.

5|$|A {{native of}} Jamaica, Queens in New York City, Clinkscales rose to {{prominence}} as {{a basketball player}} at a young age, drawing attention from coaches around the country.

5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} paint {{in his own}} naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism.

After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E
