5|$|King Malcolme {{after he}} obteined this famous victorie (as before is said) at Barre, he caused the spoile {{of the field}} to be divided amongest his souldiers, {{according}} {{to the laws of}} armes; and then caused the dead bodies of the Danes to be buried in the place where the field had baene fought, and the bodies of the Scottishmen which were found dead were conveied unto the places of christian buriall, and there buried with funerall obsequies in sundrie churches and churchyards. There are seene manie bones of the Danes in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where they were buried, there lieng bare above ground even unto this day, the sands (as it often chanceth) being blowen from them.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at <b>those</b> <b>places</b> to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, a city that Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E
5|$|The Marlboroughs {{also lost}} state funding for Blenheim Palace, and the {{building}} {{came to a halt}} {{for the first time since}} it was begun in 1705. Now in disgrace, they left England and travelled in Europe. As a result of his success in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duke of Marlborough was a favourite among the German courts and with the Holy Roman Empire, and the family was received in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> with full honours.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} types of tubes include <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> through the nose, {{including}} nasogastric, nasoduodenal, and nasojejunal tubes, and <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> {{directly into the}} abdomen, such as a gastrostomy, gastrojejunostomy, or jejunostomy feeding tube.|$|R

5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed among <b>those</b> <b>places</b> to {{be granted}} county borough status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its county borough status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the county borough proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and this was something that Hanley could not agree too.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where the rack is laid.|$|E

5|$|Due to flooding, troops {{evacuated}} {{dozens of}} communities along the Gulf coast. Many desert communities {{throughout the state}} were left without any telephone or electrical service; wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered. Dozens of scores of huts were destroyed. Many humans were swept into the gulf. Sixteen people died inside {{the remains of a}} building. Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage. However, there are no known reports of any casualties in all four of <b>those</b> <b>places.</b> Hurricane Liza was also one of six hurricane to directly impact Los Cabos.|$|E
5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{restrictions}} {{imposed upon}} the flaminica {{were similar to}} <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> on her husband. She was prohibited from mounting a staircase consisting of more than three steps, perhaps to prevent her ankles from being seen.|$|R
50|$|It was {{recorded}} by Ian Dury, originally {{on the soundtrack}} album Apples (1989) and later on The Bus Driver's Prayer & Other Stories (1992). Dury used only <b>those</b> <b>place</b> names that refer to locations in London.|$|R
50|$|The genus Allonautilus {{contains}} {{two species of}} nautiluses, which have a significantly different morphology from <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in the sister taxon Nautilus. Allonautilus is now {{thought to be a}} descendant of Nautilus and the latter paraphyletic.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} Highway58 is tumultuous due to various {{relocation}} projects {{resulting from the}} construction of the fourth Welland Canal and Highway406. Prior to 1997, Highway58 was continuous and travelled through the west side of Welland, maintained under a Connecting Link agreement. The route was first established in 1935, though it remained unnumbered on the 1935 and 1936 official road maps. By 1937 it extended from Port Colborne to St. Catharines, though the route it travelled between <b>those</b> <b>places</b> shifted several times over the following 30 years. In the late 1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred several highways or portions of highways throughout the province to lower levels of government. Highway58 was decommissioned through Welland on April1, 1997.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how game player recognition and recall of ads {{are affected by}} ad placement, level of involvement with the game, and experience with video games. Test results supported the hypothesis that moderately involved players will recall and recognize more advertisements within the focal center than <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in the periphery of vision. However, the hypothesis that highly experienced and highly involved players would not recall or recognize focal center advertisements was only partially supported. While highly involved/highly experienced players did recognize the focal center advertisements better than <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> peripherally, they could not recall ads regardless of their location within the game...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of 10 {{years of}} {{closeouts}} from a western Kansas feedlot demonstrated that steer performance exhibits significant seasonal variation. Steers weighing 700 to 800 lb when placed on feed in September through December had feed conversions roughly 12 % higher than <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in March and April. Although feed conversion varied seasonally, dry matter feed intake varied much less, causing daily gain to mirror feed conversion. Gain was seasonally highest for steers placed in March and April and lowest for <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in September through December. Cattle feeders should consider these variations in seasonal performance, as they develop profit projections for steers {{being placed on}} feed...|$|R

25|$|Eston Cemetery {{is one of}} <b>those</b> <b>places</b> in {{the area}} which was {{probably}} named {{at the time of}} the Eston Urban District Council, which included Normanby. Nevertheless, Eston Cemetery can be said to be in Normanby.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} child maltreatment and future offending {{from the viewpoint of}} former clients. Imprisoned adults describe their experiences in child welfare and juvenile justice system services. Specifically, <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> out of the home originally into the child welfare system have a different perspective on their path to prison than <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> into the juvenile justice system as delinquents. The study contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between the services children receive in the child welfare system as well as the juvenile justice system and their imprisonment as adults from a former service recipient 2 ̆ 7 s point of view...|$|R

25|$|The term ghetto {{originally}} {{referred to}} <b>those</b> <b>places</b> in European cities where Jews {{were required to}} live according to local law. During the 20th century, ghetto came {{to be used to}} describe the areas inhabited by a variety of groups that mainstream society deemed outside the norm, including not only Jews but poor people, LGBT people, ethnic minorities, hobos, prostitutes, and bohemians.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the era of}} the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the 1830s, many collieries used wooden waggonways to {{move the}} mineral. By the eighteenth century these had {{achieved}} a degree of sophistication with proper guidance systems, and flanged wheels on the waggons had become widespread, although not universal. These waggonways were developed principally on Tyneside, and in Shropshire, and the technology was disseminated at first from <b>those</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} 20 teams, {{shown by}} region, {{qualified for the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup. Of the 20 teams, only four of <b>those</b> <b>places</b> were automatically allocated {{and did not have}} to play any qualification matches. These went to the champions, runners-up and the third-placed nations at the 1995 and the tournament host, Wales. A record 65 nations from five continents were therefore involved in the qualification process designed to fill the remaining 16 spots.|$|E
