40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} Electronic <b>Throttle</b> <b>Controller</b> (ETC) module in BLDC motor without the hall sensor for detecting a rotor position. The proposed ETC control system, which is mainly consisted of a BLDC motor, a throttle plate, a return spring and reduction gear, has a position sensor with an analogue voltage output on the throttle valve instead of BLDC motor for detecting the rotor position. So the additional commutation information is necessarily needed to control the ETC module. For this, the estimation method is applied. In order to improve and obtain the high resolution for the position control, it is generally needed to change the gear ratio of the module or the electrical switching method etc. In this paper, the 3 -phase switching between successive commutations is adapted instead of the 2 -phase switching that is conventionally used. In addition, the position control with a variable PI gain is applied to improve a dynamic response during a transient period and reduce vibration at a stop in case of matching position reference. The mentioned method {{can be used to}} estimate the commutation state and operate the high-precision position control for the ETC module and the high response characteristics.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the problem of}} {{autonomous}} landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle named AE- 2 is addressed. The guidance and control technique is developed and demonstrated through numerical simulation results. The complete work includes Mathematical modeling, Control design, Guidance and State estimation for AE- 2, which is a ﬁxed wing vehicle with 2 m wing span and 6 kg weight. The aerodynamic data for AE- 2 is available from static wind tunnel tests. Functional ﬁt is done on the wind tunnel data with least squares method to ﬁnd static aerodynamic coeﬃcients. The aerodynamic forces and moment coeﬃcients are highly nonlinear {{some of them are}} partitioned in two zones based on the angle of attack. The dynamic derivatives are found with Athena Vortex Lattice software. For the validation of vortex lattice method the static derivatives obtained by the wind tunnel tests and vortex lattice method, are compared before ﬁnding dynamic derivatives. The dynamics of the servo actuators for the aerodynamic control surfaces is incorporated in the simulation. The nonlinear dynamic inversion technique has been used for the guidance and control design. The control is structured in two loops, outer and inner loop. The goal of outer loop is to track the guidance commands of altitude, roll angle and yaw angle by converting them into body rate commands through dynamic inversion. The inner loop than tracks these commanded roll rate, pitch rate and yaw rate by ﬁnding the required deﬂection of control surfaces. The forward velocity of the vehicle is controlled by varying the <b>throttle.</b> A <b>controller</b> for actuator is also designed to reduce the lag. The guidance for landing consists of three phases approach, glideslope and ﬂare. During approach the vehicle is aligned with the runway and guided to a speciﬁed height from where the glideslope can begin. The glideslope is straight line path speciﬁed by a ﬂight path angle which is restricted between 3 to 4 degree. At the end of glideslope which is marked by ﬂare altitude the ﬂare maneuver begins which is an exponential curve. The problem of transition between the glideslope and ﬂare has addressed by ensuring continuity and smoothness at transition. The exponential curve of ﬂare is designed to end below the ground so that it intersects the ground at a prespeciﬁed point. The sink rate at touchdown is also controlled along with the location of touchdown point. The state estimation has been done with Extended Kalman Filter in continuous discrete formulation. The external disturbances like wind shear and wind gust are accounted by appending them in state variables. Further the control design with guidance is tested from various initial conditions, in presence of wind disturbances. The designed ﬁlter has also been tested for parameter uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Current {{emphasis}} on decreasing vehicle fuel consumption {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) emission from the automotive sector directs many research efforts towards two gasoline engine technologies, namely, the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines, and the downsized TurboCharged (TC) Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) engines with variable valve timing (VVT). In the HCCI category, many actuation strategies have been proposed with the more popular being the dual-fuel strategies and the high residual recycling. In this thesis, a heat recycling strategy is considered, specifically, a heated-air inlet HCCI engine with two intake throttles that control the cold and hot air streams. To facilitate the control analysis and development, a physics-based crank-angle resolved and a mean-value models are developed for feedback controller design. We discover that the combustion duration defined as the duration between the crank angle of 10 % and 90 % fuel burned, provides a universal set point for all speeds and loads for both combustion stability and fuel efficiency. Based on a novel allocation of two actuators, the hot and cold <b>throttles,</b> a feedback <b>controller</b> is designed and simulated to regulate the combustion duration at a desired value during load changes. In the category of the TC SIDI engines, we address the important problem of reducing the calibration complexity when these engines are intended to run on gasoline (E 0) and/or a blend of up to 85 % ethanol (E 85). Typically, there is variability in the optimal VVT and spark values for every blend of gasoline-ethanol. This variability burdens the calibration task for these engines with many degrees of freedom (throttle, VVT, wastegate, fuel injection timing and duration, and spark timing). We first address the transient coupling between throttle and VVT in controlling the air charge. A model-based valve compensator is designed to improve the transient behavior of cylinder charge and torque during tip-ins and tip-outs with the VVT system transitions from set-points. An extremum seeking (ES) controller tuned based on the engine model demonstrates the convergence of both spark timing and VVT to the optimal values to achieve the best fuel efficiency...|$|R
