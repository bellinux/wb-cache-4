5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy.

5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk.

Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which he was expected <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed {{a couple of hours}} later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California. He {{was picked}} up by 30-year-old Richard Lynn Ernest, a {{concrete}} laborer from Loma Linda, California {{on his way to a}} construction job in Denver, Colorado.

Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove off in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic and {{not knowing what to}} feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant.

5|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Valiant fleet because of metal fatigue in December 1964 meant that the RAF had no front line tanker aircraft, so the B.1/1A aircraft, now judged to be surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to B(K).1A standard (later redesignated B.1A (K2P)), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of their plight reached the Parsis, who by this time had become quite prosperous, Parsi funds were set up to help the Iranian Zoroastrians and emissaries were {{dispatched}} to Iran. A Parsi philanthropist, Maneckji Limji Hataria, was sent to help them. He found only 7711 Zoroastrians in Kerman, Yazd and Tehran (now the capital of Iran). Using his influence with the British government he managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of the repression against Zoroastrians removed. Jizya was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1882, when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.|$|E
5|$|At {{the church}} council, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in {{wrapping}} paper to tempt her, but Lisa {{runs from the}} home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple she tells Richard Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion - thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone {{that she will be}} celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism {{for the rest of her}} life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.|$|E

Although initially grateful, Gloria begins to reminisce about Snake, causing her to break up with Burns and become Snake's girl again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Mr. Burns fires Homer for his laziness and incompetence. Looking for work, Homer answers a {{classified}} ad {{to become a}} grave digger. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns is nearing the completion of his giant robotic laborer, which he hopes will eventually replace weak-bodied human workers. The only remaining step is to implant a human brain into the machine's body. Searching a graveyard the following night, Mr. Burns mistakes Homer, snoring in an open grave, for a newly buried corpse and, despite signs that Homer may still be alive, removes Homer's brain with an ice cream scoop and places it in the robot. However, Robo-Homer is just as lazy and incompetent as he was as a human, using his X-ray vision to locate donuts. Mr. Burns declares the experiment a failure and, after restoring the brain to Homer's still-living body, kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes Mr. Burns. Afterward, he tells Smithers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> surgical tools and ether.|$|E
