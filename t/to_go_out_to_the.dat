25|$|The sergeants were of {{interest}} to SHAI since they belonged to the field security unit and worked with the Tulkarm police, which {{was in charge of}} the Sharon district. Their mission was to circulate within the local population and pick up information on the Irgun and Lehi and their supporters. They often operated in civilian clothes and were not subject to standing orders intended to prevent abduction attempts. Notably, they did not have to leave camp in groups of four, and sometimes went unarmed. Weinberg was very successful in his task, and occasionally got the sergeants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netanya beach.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the day, Jalisco and its {{surroundings}} states were restored to normality, but Jalisco authorities recommended its citizens to remain indoors if they had no obligation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> streets. The red alert lasted until May 3, and the government issued a preventative security phase following the red alert's cancellation. The government clarified that the coordinated efforts of all three levels of government continued uninterrupted despite the cancellation. Governor Sandoval Díaz denied that the additional federal forces in Jalisco meant that the state was being militarized. The government confirmed that in addition to the passengers killed in Villa Purificación, 8 suspected CJNG members and a state police officer from Autlán were killed in other clashes derived from the May 1 attacks. Several state and federal police officers were reported wounded in confrontations in Jalisco and other states.|$|E

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies that day. There {{are any number of}} factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

The attacks on leading hotels, hospitals and public transport in Mumbai, the business and financial capital of India, show that the terrorists are targeting an important sector of the Indian economy, with a view (to) destabilising democracy in India".|$|E
2500|$|Collingwood, a close naval {{friend of}} Horatio Nelson, had {{previously}} commanded the 64-gun [...] He received orders <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies, {{there to protect}} British interests in the Caribbean and to enforce the Navigation Acts which now applied to American ships trading with British colonies. Collingwood sailed in late September for Antigua, carrying John Moutray, the new commissioner for English Harbour, and his wife Mary. Also aboard his ship as Collingwood's servant was Jeffrey Raigersfeld, the son of Baron Raigersfeld, the secretary and chargé d'affaires to the Austrian ambassador to London. Collingwood was joined by Nelson, now commanding the 28-gun [...] in July 1784, with Nelson becoming the senior officer on the station. Together with Collingwood's younger brother Wilfred, who had arrived on the station {{in command of the}} 14-gun sloop , the officers decided to take a firm stance on implementing the Navigation Acts, despite the apparent unwillingness to do so by the more senior officers, such as Moutray, the station's commander Admiral Sir Richard Hughes, and the Governor of the Leeward Islands, Thomas Shirley. Hughes and Shirley were both making money from the trade.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most people}} who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that the {{president}} of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was going to make some remarks. [...] The family went to the town square where the procession was to form <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cemetery that had not been completed yet. [...] At the head of the procession rode Abraham Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. [...] Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the [...] "most finished orator of the day." [...] Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and [...] "with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address." [...] During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln's [...] "serious face." [...] Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened [...] "intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly," [...] he explains, [...] "boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards." [...] But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about [...] "honest Abe," [...] there would have been a [...] "junior battle of Gettysburg." [...] In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically [...] "echoing through the hills." ...|$|E
