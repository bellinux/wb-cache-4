5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two small groups of tanks broke through <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began {{at this time to}} service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About a third of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room {{for a more detailed}} and characterised narrative.|$|E

The districts had a specified number of battalions and regiments organised along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Army. He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps to train and administer the Territorial Force. The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two years, Jinnah worked to build support among Muslims for the League.

He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{frequently}} used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive {{lines of the}} text he was setting. An example is his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.|$|E

The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E

The {{goal was}} to break through <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the Ardennes offensive, the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive. By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November {{the brigade}} secured a {{bridgehead}} over the river. To help defend the crossing, the 3rd and 11th Squadrons dug {{in on the}} northern bank. The next day, at 14:45, the squadrons were attacked and by 17:45, first the horse holders and the regiment's mounts were sent back across the river. The squadrons were forced to retire to <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporting infantry. By 20:00 the entire British position was under threat and had to withdraw back across {{to the south of}} the river. The regiment's casualties were one dead, one missing and nineteen wounded, including Whitehorn. Command of the regiment temporarily passed to Major Duncan Munro.|$|E

5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden.

5|$|The Army was {{nonetheless}} overruled by Hitler, {{who had a}} long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany's U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered {{the construction of a}} massive bunker (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.|$|E

5|$|The {{pattern that}} the line-ending words follow is often {{explained}} if the numbers 1 to 6 {{are allowed to}} stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding stanza (i.e., last and first, then second-from-last and second, then third-from-last and third).

5|$|The twenty-seven story Rand Tower, {{built in}} 1929, {{was the next}} major {{challenger}} to the height limit. The thirty-two story Foshay Tower, also built in 1929, was the highest building in Minneapolis until 1971.

The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
