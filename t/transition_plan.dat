40|$|<b>Transition</b> <b>planning</b> for {{students}} with disabilities is often a difficult process {{for students}}, their families, and their teachers. Families are often unsure of how best to help their student and often feel unheard by the professionals with whom they are working (Defur, Todd-Allen 2 ̆ 6 Getzel, 2001.) Teachers are also unsure of how to best implement <b>transition</b> <b>planning</b> strategies in the classroom (Thoma, Pannazzo, Fritton 2 ̆ 6 Bartholomew, 2008). <b>Transition</b> <b>planning</b> is often poorly aligned with the desired end outcomes for students (Thompson, Fulk 2 ̆ 6 Piercy, 2000) and parents and teachers lack systematic guidance in decision making for <b>transition</b> <b>planning.</b> This project included the development and evaluation of a <b>transition</b> <b>planning</b> guide for parents and teachers of transition-age students with moderate to severe disabilities.

2500|$|The {{test was}} {{announced}} because the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (commonly referred to its acronym TAKS) assessment was repealed by Texas Senate Bill 1031 in spring 2007.

STAAR mostly replaced the TAKS in the spring of 2012, although students who entered 10th grade before the 2011-2012 school year continued to take the TAKS. This process is part of the TAKS to STAAR <b>transition</b> <b>plan.</b> In 2015 the last students had taken the TAKS test, so the first students will graduate with a completed STAAR end of course assessments.

Current standardized and nonstandardized assessment procedures that focus on adult outcomes, as well as preferences and interests in planning for the future, are described.
