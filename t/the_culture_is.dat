5|$|Kerala has {{the lowest}} {{positive}} population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.712 in 2015; the highest literacy rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised {{by more than half}} of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. <b>The</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.|$|E

25|$|Cultures: High {{sensitivity}} and specificity, {{but only if}} done two weeks following antibiotic discontinuation. Gram stains have low specificity and sensitivity.

25|$|The {{culture in}} Southeast Asia is very diverse: on {{mainland}} Southeast Asia, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> {{a mix of}} Indochinese (Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand) and Chinese (Vietnam). While in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Indian, Islamic, Western, and Chinese cultures. Also Brunei shows a strong influence from Arabia. Singapore and Vietnam show more Chinese influence in that Singapore, although being geographically a Southeast Asian nation, {{is home to a}} large Chinese majority and Vietnam was in China's sphere of influence for much of its history. Indian influence in Singapore is only evident through the Tamil migrants, which influenced, to some extent, the cuisine of Singapore. Throughout Vietnam's history, it has had no direct influence from India – only through contact with the Thai, Khmer and Cham peoples.|$|E

Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>is,</b> and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the Idiran-Culture War, and the existence of {{a very small number of}} 'Referrers' (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known chariots {{have been}} found in Sintashta burials, and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the Old World and {{played an important role in}} ancient warfare.

25|$|Due to {{the many}} years of the civil war, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> heavily {{influenced}} by the countries neighboring South Sudan.

25|$|In Matter, it is {{described}} {{that there are}} a number of other galactic civilizations that come close to or potentially even surpass the Culture in power and sophistication. <b>The</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>is</b> very careful and considerate of these groupings, and while still trying to convince them of the Culture ideal, will be much less likely to openly interfere in their activities.|$|E
25|$|The densest {{evidence}} for <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> {{on the middle}} Danube, the upper and middle Elbe, and the upper and middle Rhine.

25|$|African-American culture, {{also known}} as Black-American culture, refers to the {{cultural}} contributions of African Americans {{to the culture of}} the United States, either as part of or distinct from mainstream American culture.

25|$|The Culture {{itself is}} {{described}} as having been created when several humanoid species and machine sentiences reached a certain social level, and took not only their physical, but also their civilizational evolution into their own hands. In The Player of Games, <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>is</b> described as having existed as a space-faring society for eleven thousand years. In The Hydrogen Sonata, one of these founding civilisations was named as the Buhdren Federality.|$|E
25|$|Crème fraîche is {{produced}} by adding a starter culture to heavy cream, and allowing it to stand at appropriate temperature until thick. <b>The</b> <b>culture</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of a}} mix of bacteria including Lactococcus species L. cremoris, L. lactis, and L. lactis biovar diacetylactis. This is what gives it the taste that distinguishes it from similar dairy products like sour cream.
