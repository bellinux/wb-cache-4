5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said,</b> meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that the nurses feared {{losing their jobs}} if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{condemned}} {{physical and}} verbal violence against homosexual persons, but asserted that condemnation of violence {{did not mean}} that the homosexual orientation was good or neutral or that homosexual sexual acts should be permitted. The letter also said that accepting homosexual acts as morally equivalent to married heterosexual acts was harmful to the family and society and warned bishops to be on guard against, and not to support, Catholic organizations not upholding the Church's doctrine on homosexualitygroups which <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> were not really Catholic. This alluded to LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholic groups such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, and which ultimately resulted in the exclusion of Dignity from Church property.|$|E

[...] Shortly after, Smith's family released a letter on July 17, 2010, stating that he had a [...] "progressive neurocognitive disorder", which has not been publicly disclosed as Alzheimer's or anything else. He had trouble remembering the names of some of his players, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said,</b> but he could not forget what his relationships with those players meant.

500|$|Disappointed by Shahrbaraz's failure, Khosrow II sent a {{messenger}} bearing {{a letter to}} Kardarigan, who was the second-in-command of the Sasanian army. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that Kardarigan should kill Shahrbaraz and take his army back to Ctesiphon, but the bearers of the letter were intercepted in Galatia by Byzantine soldiers, who gave the letter to Constantine III who in turn gave it to Heraclius. After reading the letter, he offered to show the letter to Shahrbaraz in a meeting at Constantinople. Shahrbaraz accepted his proposal and met Heraclius at Constantinople, where he read the letter and switched over to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then changed {{the contents of the}} letter, making it state that Khosrow II wanted 400 officers killed, ensuring that Kardarigan {{and the rest of the}} army remained loyal to him.|$|E
500|$|After Till went missing, a three-paragraph {{story was}} {{printed in the}} Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They {{reported}} on his death when the body was found. The next day, when {{a picture of him}} his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction." [...] <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.|$|E

The arrested blogger, Mohamed Hassan also worked as a fixer for foreign journalists visiting the country and his lawyer, AbdulAziz Mosa was arrested after tweeting that Hassan was mistreated in prison. On 2 August, a second photographer, Qassim Zain Aldeen was arrested. Several Bahrain-based rights organizations wrote an open letter on 6 August co-signed {{by a number of}} international NGOs asking other international NGOs, mainstream media, Bahrain allies and the United Nations to pay close attention to Bahrain over the next week, especially on 14 August, which they said would likely see the country [...] "come under lockdown". <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> the rights situations in Bahrain has [...] "rapidly deteriorated" [...] during the previous weeks.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Department of State {{spokesman}} Nicholas Burns {{rejected the}} Nazi comparisons {{in the open}} letter as [...] "outrageous" [...] and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, [...] "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." [...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> <b>said</b> that those who signed it [...] "don't {{know a thing about}} Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{the council}} of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets {{announced}} its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture {{at a fraction of}} its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to [...] "explore options" [...] for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that the sale [...] "goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale" [...] of the work.|$|E

50|$|In 1753 Goodall edited a {{new issue}} of the garbled Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland, {{originally}} published by David Crawford. His interest in the partisan Memoirs was connected with the favourable representation they contained of the career of Queen Mary. He planned to write her life, and published in 1754, in two volumes, an Examination of <b>the</b> <b>Letters</b> <b>said</b> to be written by Mary Queen of Scots to James, Earl of Bothwell. This work presaged the apologist period of the literature relating to the queen.|$|R
500|$|The NSWCA {{were outraged}} by Lord Harris's letter and convened a special meeting to {{consider}} their response and subsequently had their honorary secretary, Mr J.M. Gibson, write to The Daily Telegraph in reply. [...] Gibson argued that [...] "the misconduct of those who took possession of the wickets has been exaggerated" [...] and that Lord Harris's account was [...] "universally regarded here as both inaccurate and ungenerous." [...] <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "We cannot allow a libel upon the people of New South Wales so utterly unfounded as this to pass without challenge". It went on to accuse Harris of omitting certain facts in his account, which according to the NSWCA, depicted Australia and the cricket authorities in a poor light. These included an accusation that Harris had failed {{to note that the}} NSWCA and the media had immediately and strongly condemned the disturbance and treatment of the English visitors. Gibson also criticised Lord Harris for claiming that Coulthard was [...] "competent", while [...] "admitting 'he had made two mistakes in our innings'", especially as Coulthard's not out ruling against Lord Harris [...] "was openly admitted by his lordship to be a mistake" [...] that favoured the Englishmen. The letter further denied the claim that those who incited the riot were associated with the NSWCA and accused Harris of inflammatory conduct during the disorder.|$|E
500|$|After the meeting, Quintanilla, Jr. {{discovered}} the fan club's checks were signed with Maria Elida's signature in handwriting identical to Saldívar's. He concluded that Saldívar was writing forged checks using her sister's name then cashing them {{and keeping the}} funds. When Quintanilla, Jr. was trying to retrieve the fan club's bank statements, he said they had [...] "vanished". He found a letter in Saldívar's handwriting stating that Maria Elida had to close the bank account because of a major problem. According to the letter, {{a member of the}} fan club, Yvonne Perales, was sent to the bank to deposit $3,000 but Perales did not deposit the money and could not be found. The letter stated that Maria Elida found out about the situation [...] "too late" [...] and that Perales and the money were missing. Maria Elida then wrote checks to be cashed by Saldívar, even though the bank account had no funds. <b>The</b> <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> Maria Elida was closing the account for that reason and that the bank would have to cover the checks. Quintanilla, Jr. confronted Saldívar about Perales' identity; he said Saldívar knew nothing about her. Quintanilla, Jr. said Saldívar did not trust the treasurer of the fan club but she had trusted a complete stranger to deposit $3,000. He told Saldívar to [...] "tell that lie to someone else". He concluded that Perales did not exist, since none of the fan club workers had ever met her.|$|E
