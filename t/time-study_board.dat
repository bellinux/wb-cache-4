40|$|This is an activity-oriented {{guide for}} general {{mathematics}} classes, grades 8 - 12. Mathematics used includes measurement, estimation, time, computation, ratio, and money. Students {{assume the role}} of an industrial engineering technician determining the amount of time allowed and operator pay for completing an operation on a production line. A deck of playing cards, a clipboard, a stopwatch, and graph paper are needed. The term "piece rate, " related with other pay methods is explained, using an example. The method to set the piece rate is described: (1) breaking the operation-into parts; (2) setting quality standards; (3) developing workplace layout; (4) developing methods; (5) determining time allowed; (6) considering other costs; and (7) assembling this information. Other uses, such as time and motion studies, and equipment justification are discussed. Figures of the stopwatch, <b>time-study</b> <b>board,</b> worksheets, seven exercises, and three projects are presented. Benchmark for hand movement, benchmark for, walking, setting a base rate, and manufacturing company forms are provided in the appendices. (YP) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document. rPiece Rat...|$|E
