5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> to inspect <b>the</b> <b>crease,</b> without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he later}} became renowned {{for his ability}} to occupy <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> for hours of {{defensive}} play, he was capable of playing attacking cricket.

In his previous Gillette Cup match, the quarter-final against Somerset, Boycott took 32overs to accumulate 23runs.|$|E
5|$|Australia took a first innings lead of 134 and Davidson removed Subba Row and Barrington {{with the}} new ball in the second innings to end with 2/50 and help set up a five wicket victory.

It {{was the first time}} Davidson had tasted Test victory on English soil in three tours.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown did not play. Harvey came to <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> at 3/304 {{and put on}} 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294. He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95. During his innings, Harvey repeatedly advanced out of <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> to attack the spinners. Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, their highest score of the tour, which underpinned a dominant innings victory. Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard, who ended with 0/186. Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used {{in the first two}} Tests had failed to challenge the supremacy of Australia’s batsmen, but the tourists’ attack ended his prospects. Loxton's innings earned him Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E

50|$|Law 9: Bowling, popping, {{and return}} creases. This law sets out the {{dimensions}} and locations of <b>the</b> <b>creases.</b> <b>The</b> bowling <b>crease,</b> which is <b>the</b> line the stumps {{are in the}} middle of, is drawn {{at each end of the}} pitch so that the three stumps in the set of stumps at that end of the pitch fall on it (and consequently it is perpendicular to the imaginary line joining the centres of both middle stumps). Each bowling crease should be 8 ft in length, centred on the middle stump at each end, and each bowling crease terminates at one of <b>the</b> return <b>creases.</b> <b>The</b> popping <b>crease,</b> which determines whether a batsman is in his ground or not, and which is used in determining front-foot no balls (see law 24), is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each of the two sets of stumps. <b>The</b> popping <b>crease</b> must be 4 ft in front of and parallel to <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease.</b> Although it is considered to have unlimited length, <b>the</b> popping <b>crease</b> must be marked to at least 6 ft on either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the middle stumps. <b>The</b> return <b>creases,</b> which are <b>the</b> lines a bowler must be within when making a delivery, are drawn on each side of each set of the stumps, along each sides of the pitch (so there are four return creases in all, one on either side of both sets of stumps). <b>The</b> return <b>creases</b> lie perpendicular to <b>the</b> popping <b>crease</b> and <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease,</b> 4 ft either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease terminates at one end at <b>the</b> popping <b>crease</b> but <b>the</b> other end is considered to be unlimited in length and must be marked to a minimum of 8 ft from <b>the</b> popping <b>crease.</b>|$|R
25|$|Four return creases are drawn, one on {{each side}} of each set of stumps. <b>The</b> return <b>creases</b> lie {{perpendicular}} to <b>the</b> popping <b>crease</b> and <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease,</b> 4 feet 4inches (1.32 m) either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps.

5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> Miller made five, before Harvey came to <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of Bangladesh's opening bowler, Mortaza, Australia opened the innings with Andrew Symonds and Michael Bevan— giving the usual middle-order batsmen time at <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> The Symonds {{experiment}} did not last long, as he was dismissed by Hasibul Hossain for seven. Martyn joined Bevan at <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> and quickly put the bowlers on the back foot with aggressive batting. Despite returning in the series {{for the first time}} since the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of a broken finger, he scored Australia's second fastest ODI half-century22 ballsand was on track to overtake Gilchrist's and Allan Border's record for the fastest Australian ODI century; 78 deliveries. Together they added 131 runs from 91 balls, seeing Australia home by nine wickets. Named man of the match, Martyn finished with 92 from 51 balls, dominating the partnership with Bevan, who scored 40 from 62 balls. Martyn was especially severe on Bangladeshi captain Khaled Mahmud, hitting three fours and a six from successive balls in Mahmud's second over. The captain finished with the unflattering figures of 0/34 from three overs.|$|E

25|$|As {{illustrated}} above, {{the pitch}} is marked {{at each end}} with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return <b>creases.</b> <b>The</b> three stumps are aligned centrally on <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease,</b> which is eight feet eight inches long. <b>The</b> popping <b>crease</b> is drawn four {{feet in front of}} <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease</b> and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is in fact unlimited in length. <b>The</b> return <b>creases</b> are drawn at right angles to <b>the</b> popping <b>crease</b> so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind <b>the</b> bowling <b>crease,</b> but is also in fact unlimited in length.|$|R
40|$|Creasing is a {{physiological}} disorder in navel oranges and causes serious economic losses. In 2007, the comparative changes in rheological {{properties of the}} rind, levels of starch, phenolics, pectins and the activity of pectinesterase (PE) in albedo and flavedo tissues of the healthy and <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> fruit of ‘Washington Navel’ and ‘Navelina’ sweet orange at ripe stage were investigated. During 2009, dynamics of the activities of PE, exo and endo polygalacturonase (exo-PG, endo-PG), and endo- 1, 4 -ß -D-glucanase (EGase) enzymes in albedo and flavedo tissues of the healthy as well as <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> ‘Washington Navel’ sweet orange fruit at different maturation and ripening stages were researched. The rind hardness, stiffness and tensile force were substantially lower in <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> fruit than <b>the</b> healthy ones in ‘Washington Navel’ and ‘Navelina’. The levels of starch, total phenolics, total pectins and water insoluble pectins decreased in the albedo and flavedo of <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> than <b>the</b> healthy fruit in both the cultivars. The levels of water soluble pectins increased in the albedo and flavedo of <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> fruit {{when compared to the}} healthy ones in both the cultivars. The activities of PE in albedo and flavedo tissues were higher in <b>the</b> <b>creased</b> fruit when compared to the healthy fruit of ‘Washington Navel’ and ‘Navelina’ in 2007. The activities of PE, exo and endo PG and Endo- 1, 4 -ß -D-glucanase were higher in the albedo tissue of creased fruit of ‘Washington Navel’ orange at different fruit maturation and ripening stages. In conclusion, the higher activities of pectinesterase, exo- polygalacturonase, endo- polygalacturonase, and endo- 1, 4 -ß -D-glucanase in <b>the</b> albedo of <b>creased</b> fruit at commercial harvest seem {{to be associated with the}} enhanced loss of pectins and starch in the cell walls of albedo tissue, leading to cell wall loosening and cracks formation consequently reducing hardness, stiffness and tensile force of the rind...|$|R
5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E
5|$|The {{final game}} was also held at Gillette Stadium and {{took place on}} Memorial Day, May 25. Cornell {{controlled}} the tempo of the game for the first 56 minutes and frustrated Syracuse with a tough defense. Late in the fourth quarter, the Big Red led, 9–6, before Syracuse's Stephen Keogh and Cody Jamieson narrowed the deficit to one goal with 2:46 remaining. Keogh attempted another shot but missed, and Cornell took possession with 27.6seconds left to play. The Orange's Kenny Nims then dislodged the ball from Matt Moyer, and Keogh recovered possession. He took a wild shot, which was caught by Syracuse's Matt Abbott. As he was flattened by Cornell defenders, Abbott got off a pass to Nims, who had run from midfield to {{the very edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> Nims connected with his shot on goal to send the game into overtime. Cornell won the overtime faceoff, but Syracuse defenseman Sid Smith stripped Ryan Hurley to create a turnover. Dan Hardy feigned a shot before passing to Jamieson, positioned just beyond <b>the</b> <b>crease,</b> who scored the game-winner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>creasing</b> and folding {{behavior}} of three paperboards {{have been studied}} both experimentally and numerically. Creasing and folding studies were performed on strips in both the machine direction and the cross machine direction. A finite element model that mimicked <b>the</b> experimental <b>creasing</b> and folding setup was developed, and <b>the</b> <b>creasing</b> and folding behavior could be well predicted for all three paperboards. An experimental characterization scheme consisting of three experiments was proposed, and was shown to be sufficient to predict <b>the</b> <b>creasing</b> and folding behavior. For the whole paperboard the shear strength profiles in the through thickness direction was determined with the notched shear test. Each ply was laid free by grinding, and density measurements and in-plane tension tests were performed on the bottom, middle and top plies of each paperboard. Instead of assuming uniform properties in each ply, the shear strength profiles were used to map the measured properties in the through thickness direction. Numerical simulations were performed when the ply and interface properties of the paperboards were altered to follow different shear strength profiles. This was done in order to mimic different production strategies. It was shown that the interface strengths mainly influenced the folding behavior. Whereas altered the ply properties affected <b>the</b> <b>creasing</b> force needed. QC 20130815 </p...|$|R

5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} {{team for the}} Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson came in at 5/216 on the first afternoon and struggled to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

Make another fold across the top connecting the ends of <b>the</b> <b>creases</b> to create a triangle of creases. Unfold this fold as well.

5|$|Australia's streak {{looked in}} danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 in reply to India's 171 when Gilchrist came to <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> He counterattacked savagely, scoring 122 in just 112 balls, and {{featuring}} in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs. This swung the momentum back to Australia, who reached 349. Gilchrist took six catches {{and was named}} Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory, extending the world record run to 16.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind <b>the</b> <b>crease.</b> In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across <b>the</b> <b>crease</b> to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
