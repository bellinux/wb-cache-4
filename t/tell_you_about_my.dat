2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, {{when we were}} seated, [...] "what {{have you}} to tell? Anything wonderful? If it isn't, you'd better let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> fish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed! But I {{must not}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> husband. <b>You</b> would never {{think what he}} is--not at all like Nofri!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, my love, it is {{not worth}} giving a second thought about; and I shall not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> work on the bench, {{if you are going}} to take matters to heart like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} just at present to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> much <b>about</b> <b>my</b> affairs, and yet I {{expect you to}} do what I ask you. I don't suppose you doubt my ability to raise £750." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] he replied, [...] "that's settled. Miss Ottway {{will explain}} things to you, and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> peculiarities. And {{when she goes}} you can take her desk, by the window nearest my door." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "First of all," [...] he said, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family.

60|$|MY DEAR OLD CLAIRE,--Is {{this really}} my first letter to you? Isn't that awful! Gee! A lot's {{happened}} since I saw you last. I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> first <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hit.

6000|$|... 'Yes, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{life that}} <b>you</b> {{would like to}} know, Mr. Twain,' she said, in her soft voice, and letting her honest eyes rest placidly upon my face, 'for it is kind and {{good of you to}} like me and care to know about me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] {{said the}} old man, almost in his olden voice. [...] "You'll find by-and-by that twenty pounds are {{not so easy to}} come by. George, as you are here, I might as well <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] {{she said}} again, very softly, {{stretching}} out her arms, [...] "come {{and give me}} a kiss, and let us change the subject once and for ever. I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> poor father; he left some messages for you, Morris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are a few}} left, {{although}} their methods have changed with the times. Some day I would like to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> uncle. He was, so to speak, a survival, and I think you would appreciate him. But how have things been going in the dale?" ...|$|E

60|$|WEDNESDAY. - I {{may as well}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> exactly <b>about</b> <b>my</b> health. I am not at all ill; {{have quite}} recovered; only I am what MM.

6000|$|I {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} of quieting his mind to good purpose by suggesting a change of subject. [...] "Let us have done with serious talk for the present," [...] I proposed.

6000|$|... "Good-bye, good-bye," [...] he {{said very}} cheerily,--"A {{delightful}} chat. We must have another talk over old times soon.

40|$|This is {{my first}} visit to Leipzig. My main reasons for coming here are personal: to look up the graves and {{dwellings}} of my great-grandparents, Salomon and Rebecka Alexander, and to explore the city and the university where my grandfather, Paul Alexander, grew up and studied. But I thought that {{it would be nice to}} combine the business of family pilgrimage with the pleasure of giving a math talk. I am very grateful to Wolfgang Hackbusch for kindly accepting my offer to give a seminar talk here. I am also very thankful to all of you for coming! Even though this talk is supposed to be on math rather than on family history, let me nevertheless spend a few minutes <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> grandfather Paul Alexander, to whom this talk is dedicated. A Few Words about Paul Alexander 1. Paul got his Dr. Phil. in 1897, here in Leipzig. His dissertation was entitled: “ Über die Einwirkung von o-Nitrobenzylchlorid auf Natriummalonsäureäthylester”. 2. Paul was the inventor of efficient verfahrens for the regeneration (recycling) of caoutchouc (rubber). 3. Paul had many patents, e. g. US # 844077, issued in 1907 entitled “Process for the productio...|$|R

Now I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> <b>my</b> Edward, and you'll listen, though mamma forbade it. Three years ago my father died, and we came here.

6000|$|... "I was married, {{not very}} long since, to a Dutch gentleman, whose name is Van Brandt. Please excuse my {{entering}} into family particulars.

I really cannot see the lines as I try to write them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe so, maybe so," [...] {{the younger}} man {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "But this was not what I wished {{to speak to you}} about. Before I enter your family, your sister and you have a claim to know all that I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> career. Of my worldly prospects I have already spoken to you.

"I wanted to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> daughter," [...] he explained, when he came back after the quarter of an hour which Lanfear had found rather intense. [...] "It's useless to pretend you wouldn't have noticed--Had nobody been with you after I left you, down there?"

6000|$|He went on: [...] "I {{was about}} to say I had a deal of time to think on my long ride this morning, and I reached some {{conclusions}} which I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> When <b>my</b> prisoner was safe in the guard-house, I went over to see how my little temple of art looked--I mean your studio, of course. I closed the door and dropped into one of the big chairs, hoping to gain rest and serenity in the beauty and quiet of the place. But I didn't; I was painfully depressed." ...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{you will}} be graduating either in December or next April. Congratulations! This article is to prepare {{you for what you}} are going to face after you have {{received}} <b>you</b> diploma by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own experience with this stressful process. Within 6 months of graduating, I received a series of letters from the holders of my student loans. I already had the pleasure of paying on one of my student loans before I even graduated due to a rule that states that you have to start paying back the loan after 5 years from when it was first distributed. Fun stuff right? [...] . More. By Annette Andersen, U of U Campus Ambassador You arrive a few minutes before class starts, turn to a fellow classmate and engage yet again in a conversation. The lighthearted rapport is a nice break in your busy life as a college student. But have you ever thought how important it is to get to know your fellow classmates? Five plus years from now those fellow students could be a CFO, a manager in a public accounting firm, a controller or a consultant you will want to engage for a special project. There is a goo...|$|R
