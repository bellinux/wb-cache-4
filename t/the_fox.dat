5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fox</b> terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs {{of today}} are all descended from dogs of that period, {{although}} documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 {{have not been}} found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. <b>The</b> <b>Fox</b> Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell {{as one of the}} founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then.
