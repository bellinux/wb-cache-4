40|$|Most of {{the large}} number of {{internal}} sorting algorithms are based on the use of arrays or linked lists. This report highlights the use of tree structures for internal sorting. It is shown that the ordered binary tree can be used very effectively for sorting data, whatever the initial ordering of the input may be. It is also shown that the B-Trees, normally used to process large files on disks, can also be effectively employed to sort data in main memory. In both cases, a simple inorder traversal of the tree can retrieve data in sorted order. Algorithms based on binary- and B-tree structure are compared with Quick Sort and Heap Sort algorithms in terms of <b>times</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> sort various input lists. Input lists of various sizes and degrees of 'presortedness' were used in the comparison tests. It is shown that the <b>times</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> build balanced ordered binary trees are the same as or less than the <b>times</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> sort the data using Quick Sort and always better than the <b>times</b> <b>required</b> [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E

Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

5|$|HMS Unicorn was an {{aircraft}} repair ship and light aircraft carrier {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the late 1930s.

Unicorn supported the aircraft carriers of the fleet on their operations until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed in November 1944.

To shorten the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> replenish the BPF's carriers, the ship was based in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. Unicorn was decommissioned and placed in reserve when she returned to the UK in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818. After a fire destroyed the log cabin in which the Rowans lived in 1812, they moved into {{the part of the}} mansion that was completed, and continued to live there while construction {{on the rest of the}} house was finished. Federal Hill was once believed to be the first brick house constructed in the state of Kentucky, but more contemporary sources give the designation to the William Whitley House, also known as Sportsman's Hill, which was completed in 1794 near Crab Orchard, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique animations, in {{addition to}} boss characters, with their own styles of movement. The designers underestimated the length of <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on {{other parts of the}} game system.

5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital.

To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E

Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E
5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce the <b>time</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
