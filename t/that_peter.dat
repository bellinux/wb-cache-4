Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she {{is in love with}} him. Peter, however, feels that he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as Spider-Man.|$|E
5000|$|New Zealand First leader Winston Peters contested the by-election. Labour leader Andrew Little opined <b>that</b> <b>Peters,</b> aged 69 at {{the time}} of the election, would be too old for many voters to select as their new {{electorate}} MP. This was rejected by 85% of respondents to a 3 News and Reid Research poll. The Prime Minister, John Key, stated <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> had [...] "zero chance" [...] in the National Party stronghold, but softened his stance within days when the first opinion polls came out <b>that</b> had <b>Peters</b> at 35%, whilst Osborne sat at 30%.|$|R

5|$|Besides {{having the}} world's largest {{collection}} of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E
5|$|It {{is presumed}} <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> {{was a native}} of Italy, like {{the other members of the}} Gregorian mission. This mission was {{dispatched}} by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King Æthelberht of Kent, who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Kulikovsky was {{appointed}} as {{captain in the}} Blue Cuirassiers and posted to the provinces. By 1906, he and Olga were corresponding regularly, when Olga's husband Duke Peter appointed Kulikovsky as his aide-de-camp. With Peter's permission, Kulikovsky moved into the 200-room residence in Sergievskaya Street, Saint Petersburg, <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> shared with Olga. According to a fellow officer, gossip about a possible romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess, based on little more than their holding hands in public, spread through high society.|$|E
5000|$|During Starr Faithfull's teenage years, {{she began}} {{to show signs of}} {{emotional}} disturbance. She eventually received psychiatric treatment, including a short voluntary stay in the Channing Sanitarium, a mental hospital in Wellesley, Massachusetts. In June 1926, she told her mother <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> had been sexually abusing her for years, beginning when she was 11. She said <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> read her sex instructions written by Havelock Ellis and drugged her with ether before sexually abusing her.|$|R

5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time his schedule ran out, and he left the production despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E
5|$|Mary Jane {{admits she}} is {{infatuated}} with Spider-Man, who has rescued her on numerous occasions, and asks Peter whether Spider-Man ever asked about her.

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) is {{contacted}} by Tess (Susan Misner), {{a woman from}} his past who warns him to leave Boston.

40|$|Paul Hirst claimed <b>that</b> Richard <b>Peters</b> 2 ̆ 7 revolutionised {{philosophy}} of education 2 ̆ 7. This does not accord with {{my experience in}} the Antipodean periphery. My experience {{of the work of}} Wittgenstein, Austin and Kovesi before reading Peters and Dewey, Kuhn and Toulmin subsequently meant <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> was a major but not revolutionary figure in my understanding of {{philosophy of}} education...|$|R
5|$|Peter is a {{considered}} a saint, with a feast day on 6 January. His cult was confirmed in 1915. A Vita Petri, or Life of Peter, written by Eadmer in the 12th century, exists in manuscript form, {{but it is}} unreliable. There is evidence <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> was the object of veneration in Boulogne in the 15th century, and a church in that town was associated with Peter, although probably not {{from the start of}} his cult.|$|E
5|$|Peter succeeded King Stephen I, {{who died}} on 15 August 1038, and adopted an active foreign policy. Hungarian troops plundered Bavaria in 1039 and 1040, and invaded Bohemia in 1040 to assist Duke Bretislav I against Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. Hungarian chronicles recount <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> {{preferred}} the company of Germans ("who roared like wild beasts") and Italians ("who chattered and twittered like swallows"), which made him unpopular among his subjects. He introduced new taxes, seized Church revenue and deposed two bishops.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> now never existed.|$|E
5000|$|It {{may be just}} {{coincidence}} <b>that</b> <b>Peter's</b> {{words to}} her in verse 40, [...] "Tabitha, get up!" [...] (...) , {{are similar to the}} [...] "talitha kum" [...] phrase used by Jesus.|$|R
5000|$|She {{has been}} criticized by the United States National Rifle Association which claims <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> [...] "is the voice and face of hatred of gun owners and Second Amendment freedoms." ...|$|R

5|$|Peter wakes in the hospital, {{learning}} from Olivia {{that they saw}} a man safely cross the bridge and taken by Newton. When Walter arrives to see Peter, Peter tells him he has realized the truth: because he, like {{the man on the}} bridge, was not affected by the same shockwave that killed the FBI agent, he must be from the parallel universe. Walter is unable to deny Peter's accusations. The next day, Walter is devastated to learn <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> has discharged himself and has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The fictional {{village of}} Newbank in Benjamin Disraeli's novel Coningsby {{was based in}} part on the {{industrial}} village of Barrow Bridge. Spring and Port Wine by playwright, Bill Naughton was filmed and set in Bolton and The Family Way based on Naughton's play All in Good Time was also filmed and set in the town. Peter Kay filmed comedy TV series <b>That</b> <b>Peter</b> Kay Thing in the town.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>Peter</b> Waldo or any other later religious figures were directly influenced by Peter of Bruys. His low view of the Old Testament and the New Testament epistles was not shared by later Protestant figures such as Martin Luther or John Smyth. In spite of this, Peter of Bruys is considered a prophet of the Reformation by some evangelical Protestants and Anabaptists.|$|E
50|$|Catholic {{tradition}} holds <b>that</b> <b>Peter's</b> inverted crucifixion {{occurred at}} the spot now occupied by the Clementine Chapel in the grottoes of Saint Peter's Basilica, with the burial in Saint Peter's tomb nearby.|$|R
5000|$|Parson's {{voice was}} dubbed by another actor. The {{director}} {{did not feel}} <b>that</b> <b>Peter's</b> voice was [...] "New Zealand" [...] enough, though the dubbed voice sounded nothing like a New Zealander's accent.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} time <b>that</b> <b>Peters</b> and former Alarm bassist Eddie MacDonald has played {{together}} since The Alarm split in 1991. MacDonaled played acoustic guitar, as well as contributing towards the string arrangements.|$|R
