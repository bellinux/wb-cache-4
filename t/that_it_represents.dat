5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 Birmingham City Council {{decided to}} close the museum and to {{construct}} the brand new ThinkTank museum (since re-christened Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum) in nearby Digbeth. In 2001 the locomotive {{was moved to the}} Thinktank where it remains as at September 2017. It differs significantly from the other two preserved locomotives in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> the only untouched example of a British Railways Coronation locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{names of}} the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters. Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as , may {{have a variety of}} names, sometimes based on the appearance of the symbol or on the sound <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents.</b> In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.|$|E

60|$|A small photograph, {{mounted on}} a card, {{fell out of the}} book. A first glance showed me <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represented</b> the portraits of two persons.|$|R
5|$|The Gangadhara {{image is}} highly damaged, {{particularly}} {{the lower half}} of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (with broken arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the vahana (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.|$|E
5|$|The {{dead man}} is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes {{that this is}} a Seneca ritual aimed at {{reviving}} the dead to learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. When Black returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies {{of the end of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Shastry {{says that}} rhyme (Antyānuprāsa) is a {{distinguishing}} feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, {{which is most}} evident in the poetic work Ājādacandraśekharacaritam {{on the life of}} Chandrashekhar Azad. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda, various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya. Dikshit says that the nationalistic play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> all the six Sampradāyas of Indian literature (Rīti, Rasa, Alaṅkāra, Dhvani, Vakrokti and Aucitya), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of Ritikavya poets like Raskhan, Keshavdas, Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the Śṛngāra Rasa, Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.|$|E
5000|$|Author and {{literary}} critic Gore Vidal admired Bradbury and {{this story in}} particular, calling it [...] "a good short story" [...] and saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represented</b> Bradbury [...] "at his best".|$|R
5000|$|But after {{spending}} 2.4 million pounds on tests over three years, the Department for Work and Pensions revoked its {{funding for the}} program, saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> [...] "couldn't confirm <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represented</b> any good value for money." ...|$|R

5|$|The city is {{predominantly}} white {{in terms of}} ethnicity, with 91.8% of the population belonging to this ethnic group. Portsmouth's long association with the Royal Navy means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> {{one of the most}} diverse cities in terms of the peoples of the British Isles. Similarly, some {{of the largest and most}} well-established non-white communities have their roots with the Royal Navy, most notably the large Chinese community, principally from British Hong Kong. Portsmouth's long industrial history in support of the Royal Navy has seen many people from across the British Isles move to Portsmouth to work in the factories and docks, the largest of these groups being Irish Catholics. According to 2011 census, the ethnic breakdown of Portsmouth's population is as follows: 84.0% White British, 3.8% Other White, 1.3% Chinese, 1.4% Indian, 0.5% Mixed-Race, 1.8% Bangladeshi, 0.5% Other ethnic group, 1.4% Black African, 0.5% White Irish, 1.3% Other Asian, 0.3% Pakistani, 0.3% Black Caribbean and 0.1% Other Black.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E

50|$|Other {{critics have}} {{mentioned}} that Ella and Jim are actually a depiction of Ella and James, O’Neill’s parents. Because of the abusive relationship between Jim and Ella in the play, critics thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represented</b> {{the relationship between}} his parents.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the modern}} interpretations of the double cross is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> Slovakia as an heir and {{guardian}} of Christian tradition, brought to the region by St. Cyril and St. Methodius, two missionaries from the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the back}} of the book were faint {{indentations}} representing five lines of text, in capital letters. The second line has been struck out – a fact that is considered significant, due to its similarities to the fourth line and the possibility <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> an error in encryption.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} late 1960s when defecography was first developed and became widespread. Degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.|$|E

5000|$|Michael Finke {{has called}} The Steppe a [...] "dictionary of Chekhov's poetics", {{suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represented</b> a significant advance for Chekhov, exhibiting {{much of the}} quality of his mature fiction and winning him publication in a literary journal rather than a newspaper.|$|R

25|$|UNESCO {{qualified}} Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> “the best-preserved Roman {{small town}} in North Africa”. The site, which lies {{in the middle of}} the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanisation, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions.|$|E
25|$|Some believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> {{the initial}} {{form of a}} {{progressive}} spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. The folding section of rectum can cause repeated trauma to the mucosa, and can cause solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{most complex}} Chinese {{character}} {{still in use}} may be biáng (pictured right, bottom), with 58 strokes, which refers to Biang biang noodles, a type of noodle from China's Shaanxi province. This character along with the syllable biáng cannot be found in dictionaries. The fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>represents</b> a syllable that {{does not exist in}} any Standard Chinese word means that it could be classified as a dialectal character.|$|E
