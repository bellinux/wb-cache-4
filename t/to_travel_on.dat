Desha confessed that he had been living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E

5|$|The French Navy and Air Force {{had been}} {{depleted}} during World War II. They {{were unable to}} deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise an evacuation task force.|$|E
5|$|The Panhandles {{played their}} only home game at Neil Park. Joseph Carr made the team play mostly away games {{because they were}} able <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> the railroads for free. This cut down on stadium cost and saved the team money. The regular season {{schedule}} was not a fixed schedule but was created dynamically by each team as the season progressed. Over {{the course of the}} 1920 season, the Panhandles played a total of 11 games. Of those 11 games, five were against APFA teams, and the others were against non-APFA teams. Every game played against league teams resulted in a loss.|$|E

Quasi-medical staff, like repatriation teams, were no longer permitted on hospital ships.

5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> the day of the show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that {{he would be able to}} travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E

He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols {{was surprised to find}} that Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the console}} {{versions}} of Underground were significantly {{larger than those}} of earlier Tony Hawk's games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city {{in the game and}} took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice Undergrounds differences from previous Tony Hawk's titles immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions of the game. While Neversoft wanted to keep Underground realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games. However, these missions were intended not to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.|$|E

5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey {{four days a week}} and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 the operation of the coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> the outside for 9d. A more comfortable coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E
5|$|Rafting is also {{popular in}} some of the Canadian {{stretches}} of the river, especially those near the headwaters that have the steepest gradient and the most challenging rapids. Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Unit and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes. Rafting and kayaking is also an activity on the swift-flowing Slocan River, the lowermost major tributary of the Kootenay, and in parts of other major Kootenay tributaries as well.|$|E

Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. There is not a direct connect interchange at the junction of I-410. It is necessary <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>on</b> both highways' frontage roads in order to change highways. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop1604 to SH211. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604.|$|E
