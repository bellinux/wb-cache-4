5|$|Prosecuting {{attorney}} Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek) tells Howard (Melissa Leo) {{that if she}} cannot {{find more}} evidence against Ralph Fenwick (Michael Sheldon), who is a suspect in a brutal murder, Danvers will have to plead to manslaughter. The next day, Howard tells her partner Felton (Daniel Baldwin) she was visited by the ghost of Fenwick's murder victim and told where <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> was, but Howard cannot find it. Felton does not believe her, and Howard grows angry when he tells Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) about the ghost experience. The next day, however, Howard and Felton arrest Fenwick after finding <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> based on advice Felton got from a tarot card reader.|$|E
5|$|Those suspecting a {{conspiracy}} in the assassination {{point to the}} two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's Remington Gamemaster had been <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon.</b> Those tests did not implicate Ray's specific rifle.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
50|$|In James Patterson's The 8th Confession, kraits are <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> used by {{a serial}} killer.|$|R
50|$|Three {{different}} bladed weapons, {{believed to}} be knives, {{as well as a}} firearm, were used to commit <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> However, none of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> were found, though a rifle was discovered in the house.|$|R
50|$|In 1941 {{the stress}} of World War II led Arthur Lloyd James led him to kill his wife, fearing the war would {{otherwise}} cause her hardship. <b>The</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> were a fork and porker.|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon.</b> Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon,</b> the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
50|$|On November 7, 1983, while Hendricks was out {{of state}} on a {{business}} trip, {{his wife and three}} children were found murdered in their home. An axe and a butcher's knife were <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R

25|$|The mattock {{was most}} likely <b>the</b> main <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> when six {{people were killed in}} <b>the</b> brutal <b>murders</b> in Hinterkaifeck.|$|R
5|$|The dagger {{taken from}} Beauchamp at his arrest {{did not match}} the wound on Sharp's body. (In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a {{handkerchief}} found {{at the scene of the}} crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon.</b> Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2010, {{member of}} the Bharat Nepali gang, Devendra Babu Jagtap alias JD, Pintoo Deoram Dagale, Vinod Yashwant Vichare and Hasmukh Solanki, were arrested by the police under MCOCA. The police however did not conduct any {{forensic}} of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> and claimed that <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> was [...] "solved" [...] by the arrest of the accused.|$|R
5000|$|On June 10, 2010, [...] "Politics Daily" [...] {{published}} {{a report of}} recent interviews of former jurors at Skinner's trial, which states [...] "Many of the jurors interviewed were {{taken aback by the}} amount of untested evidence, stunned that even the blood on two of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> had not been analyzed. The seven jurors agreed that all the evidence should undergo DNA analysis" ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{searching the}} car about 45 minutes later, Detective Emil DiRobbio found a live [...]32 caliber pistol round under the front {{passenger}} seat and a 12-gauge shotgun shell in the trunk. Firearms Identification later established that <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> had been a [...]32 caliber pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun. [...] The defense later raised questions about this evidence, as it was not logged with a property clerk until five days after <b>the</b> <b>murders.</b> <b>The</b> prosecution responded to this line of questioning by producing a report lodged 75 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> that documents <b>the</b> presence of the [...]32 caliber pistol round and 12-gauge shotgun shell. The defense was able to show that the bullet found in the Carter car was brass cased, rather than copper coated like those found at the Lafayette Bar, and that the shotgun shell found in the Carter car was an older model, with a different wad and color. In response, the prosecution argued that the metal and make of the retrieved ammunition was meaningless because the ammunition found at the crime scene was also dissimilar. Furthermore, the ammunition found in the car was usable by <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington {{told them he}} had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules, and described <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E

5000|$|The killers were {{eventually}} {{caught by the}} Israeli security forces after intelligence {{led them to the}} house where the weapons were hidden.

After examining the weapons, an investigation led the Israeli security forces to the killers themselves.|$|R

5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} {{utility knife}} {{at the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E
5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E
5000|$|After {{killing his}} family, Gonzales {{disposed}} of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons,</b> including <b>the</b> bat {{he had used}} in striking Clodine, and the shoes and clothing he was wearing {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>murders,</b> which had become blood stained. He showered, changed clothes, and at some time during the evening, spray painted the words [...] "Fuck off Asians" [...] on a wall in the house in an attempt to fool investigating police into believing that his family had been the victims of a hate crime. Gonzales' clothes were later found to have the same paint used in the graffiti scrawl.|$|R
5000|$|In the Murdoch Mysteries episode [...] "Invention Convention", it is {{indirectly}} referenced {{at the end}} of {{the episode}} when George Crabtree suggests that a sound activated device, like <b>the</b> episode's <b>murder</b> <b>weapon,</b> could be used to turn the lights on and off.|$|R
50|$|It {{was later}} {{found that the}} killer had never entered the tent, but instead had opted to attack the {{occupants}} with a knife and an unidentified blunt instrument through the sides of <b>the</b> tent. <b>The</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> have never been located. The killer had stolen several of the victims' personal items, including their wallets {{and some of their}} clothes. Some of these clothes, and Gustafsson's shoes, were later discovered partially-hidden approximately 500 meters from <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> site. Other items of the victims, for instance Seppo Boisman's leather jacket, were never located. The tracks of blood and footprints had shown that the killer was wearing Gustafsson's shoes.|$|R
5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder of Helen Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives of Helen Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have access to some of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained the letters in 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. The letters were eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon,</b> in the newspaper's office window.|$|E
25|$|With the {{evidence}} apparently destroyed or suitably confused, the family {{believe they have}} saved Gerda. There is a final clue: the holster in which <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon</b> was kept. Gerda had cut this up {{and placed it in}} her workbag. Henrietta rushes to Gerda in an attempt to retrieve it and destroy the final proof of Gerda's guilt.|$|E
25|$|The 23-year-old woman {{also told}} the police that she knew the {{whereabouts}} of <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapon.</b> Alerted, police investigators in Göteborg could only acknowledge that observations made on the crime scene matched the woman's account of the events. Vlad was arrested the same day {{at his home in}} Stockholm. He was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol. Nödtveidt was apprehended in Göteborg on the morning of 18 December.|$|E
5000|$|Jimmy {{inherits}} {{his next}} big case {{from a friend}} dying of cancer. Serial killer Clifford Banks, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince, {{became known as the}} [...] "Street Sweeper" [...] for 17 murders. Police found a dismembered body in his van which led them to his home where they found <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons,</b> personal effects of the victims, and a journal Clifford kept of how he planned and committed <b>the</b> <b>murders</b> while making plans for more. The blue collar Clifford was intending to pay for his high-profile defense with the movie adaptation of his story being made by sleazy and comical Hollywood producer Gary Blondo.|$|R
50|$|Beach {{confessed to}} putting Nees’ {{body in a}} garbage bag feet first and then {{dragging}} her body to the river by her shoulders. However, evidence showed that Nees’ body had been dragged by her feet. Also, police had found no shred of a garbage bag on the rocky path leading to the river from the truck. Beach's confession also indicated that he threw <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> and keys to the truck into the Poplar River; however, the river was searched by divers on several occasions and none of these items were found {{in or near the}} river.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, Hakim's father, two uncles, {{and brother}} {{were arrested for}} hiding <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> <b>weapons</b> and suppressing {{additional}} evidence. Israeli security forces also arrested the PFLP militant who they had approached for weapons, and raided the Ramallah home of Yazed Hassan Mohammed Awad, Salah Awad's contact who had hidden the two stolen assault rifles following the attack. Both of the assault rifles were found in his home. In addition, Yazed Awad {{was found to have}} briefed Amjad and Hakim on Shin Bet interrogation techniques.
