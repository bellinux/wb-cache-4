40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the optimal scan parameters for the evaluation of experimental vascular stenoses with a multislice-helical CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A vascular phantom consisting of four tubes with an inner diameter of 8 mm and with experimental stenoses of 50 %, 75 % and 90 % was scanned in different tube orientations using a multislice-CT scanner (LightSpeed QX/i, GE, Milwaukee, USA). Examinations were performed with increasing collimations (1. 25 - 5 mm), <b>tube</b> <b>currents</b> (100 - 300 mA) and two different table speeds (0. 75 HQ mode and 1. 5 HS mode). RESULTS: The most exact measurements were obtained in tubes angulated parallel to the scan direction with a collimation of 2. 5 mm in the HQ mode (7. 5 mm/rot.). An almost equivalent accuracy was obtained in the HS mode (15 mm/rot.) with a collimation of 2. 5 mm when higher <b>tube</b> <b>currents</b> (300 mA) were employed. The degree of stenoses was overestimated when the tube was angulated perpendicular to the z-axis. CONCLUSION: Multislice-CT provides a good detection rate of vascular stenoses especially at 0 degree and also at 45 degrees angulation in the HQ mode. The use of the HS mode with higher <b>tube</b> <b>currents</b> allows scanning of longer distances with almost identical accuracy...|$|R

Under varying <b>tube</b> <b>currents</b> the mean APE (CCC) varied between 5. 18 % and 10. 12 % (0. 95 – 0. 99) for RECIST diameter and between 7. 22 % and 16. 21 % (0. 94 – 1. 00) for the volume.

50|$|Because {{the heart}} is {{effectively}} imaged more than once (described above), cardiac CT angiography {{can result in a}} relatively high radiation exposure (around 12 millisievert), although newer acquisition protocols, have recently been developed which drastically reduce this exposure to around 1 mSv (cfr. Pavone, Fioranelli, Dowe: Computed Tomography or Coronary Arteries, Springer 2009). By comparison, a chest X-ray carries a dose of approximately 0.02-0.2 mSv and natural background radiation exposure is around 2.3 mSv/year. Thus, each cardiac CT scan carried out with current protocols (dose approximately 1 mSv) is equivalent to approximately 5-50 chest X-rays or less than 1 year of background radiation. Methods are available to decrease this exposure; however, such as prospectively decreasing radiation output based on the concurrently acquired ECG (i.e. <b>tube</b> <b>current</b> modulation.) This can result in a significant decrease in radiation exposure, at the risk of compromising image quality if there is any arrhythmia during the acquisition.|$|E

5000|$|One {{consequence}} of the dead time effect {{is the possibility of}} a high count rate continually triggering the tube before the recovery time has elapsed. This may produce pulses too small for the counting electronics to detect and lead to the very undesirable situation whereby a G-M counter in a very high radiation field is falsely indicating a low level. This phenomenon is known as [...] "fold-back". An industry rule of thumb is that the discriminator circuit receiving the output from the tube should detect down to 1/10 of the magnitude of a normal pulse to guard against this. Additionally the circuit should detect when [...] "pulse pile-up [...] " [...] has occurred, where the apparent anode voltage has moved to a new dc level through the combination of high pulse count and noise. The electronic design of Geiger-Muller counters must be able to detect this situation and give an alarm; it is normally done by setting a threshold for excessive <b>tube</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the product}} of <b>tube</b> <b>current</b> and {{exposure}} time, measured in milliampere-seconds (mA·s), is the primary controlling factor of radiographic density, kVp also affects the radiographic density indirectly. As the energy (which {{is proportional to the}} peak voltage) of the stream of electrons in the x-ray tube increases, the x-ray photons created from those electrons are more likely to penetrate the cells of the body and reach the image receptor (film or plate), resulting in increased radiographic density (compared to lower energy beams that may be absorbed in the body {{on their way to the}} image receptor). However, scattered x-rays also contribute to increased radiographic density: the higher the kVp of the beam, the more scatter will be produced. Scatter is unwanted density (that is, density created without bringing any pertinent information to the image receptor). This is why kVp is not primarily used to control density - as the density resulting from increasing kVp passes what is needed to penetrate a part, it will only add useless information to the image.|$|E
5000|$|X-rays are {{generated}} when high energy electrons are {{stopped by a}} hard target. In the earliest tubes, the electrons were generated by the collision of positive ions with the cathode. To produce the ions, a low pressure gas had to be maintained inside the tube. Unfortunately, as this type of tube is used, the low pressure gas is gradually depleted causing the <b>tube</b> <b>current</b> and therefor the x-ray output to fall. The operator could compensate for this by increasing the voltage on the tube, but this would produce “harder” or more penetrating x-rays. In many cases this degraded the image quality. One early solution was to introduce {{a small amount of}} gas back into the tube. Unfortunately this procedure was difficult to control and it only provided a temporary solution. Saÿen’s design solved this problem by a clever strategy that ensured a constant gas pressure in the tube. As the gas in {{the main part of the}} Saÿen tube (see photo) is depleted, the electrical resistance in the tube would increase causing the current to take a lower resistance path: a spark through the air gap to the wire leading to the smaller bulb. That current would heat the material in the small bulb and cause it to release gas back into the main tube. Once the gas pressure rose in the main tube, its electrical resistance would drop back into normal operating range. The gas pressure in the tube could be adjusted by controlling the size of the air gap: a larger gap meant that the tube would operate at a higher voltage with harder (higher energy, more penetrating) x-rays. Saÿen used potash (potassium hydroxide, KOH) in the side bulb but other chemicals that would outgas when heated were also used. [...] James W.

The detection of small pancreatic tumors which are still resectable is still a challenging problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of decreasing the tube voltage from 120 to 80 [*]kV on the detection of pancreatic tumors. Methods Three scanning protocols was used; one using the standard tube voltage (120 [*]kV) and current (160 [*]mA) and two using 80 [*]kV but with different <b>tube</b> <b>currents</b> (500 and 675 [*]mA) to achieve equivalent dose (15 [*]mGy) and noise (15 HU) as that of the standard protocol. Tumors were simulated into collected CT phantom images. The attenuation in normal parenchyma at 120 [*]kV was set at 130 HU, as measured previously in clinical examinations, and the tumor attenuation was assumed to differ 20 HU and was set at 110 HU. By scanning and measuring of iodine solution with different concentrations the corresponding tumor and parenchyma attenuation at 80 [*]kV was found to be 185 and 219 HU, respectively. To objectively evaluate the differences between the three protocols, a multi-reader multi-case receiver operating characteristic study was conducted, using three readers and 100 cases, each containing 0 – 3 lesions. Results The highest reader averaged figure-of-merit (FOM) was achieved for 80 [*]kV and 675 [*]mA (FOM[*]=[*] 0, 850), and the lowest for 120 [*]kV (FOM[*]=[*] 0, 709).
