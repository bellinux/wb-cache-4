2500|$|In 1893 William Doxford and Sons Ltd. ("Doxford") of Sunderland, England built one {{whaleback}} under license {{from the}} type's designer, but had already built its first turret deck ship to a design by Arthur Havers, the concern's chief draughtsman. Havers toned down {{the more radical}} features of the whaleback. His design retained conventional bows and sterns instead of the upswept conoid [...] "snout" [...] of the whaleback. Instead of a rounded hull, the hull of a <b>turret</b> <b>vessel</b> was stepped inward above the waterline, but the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the hull met in curves rather than by right angles as in conventional ships. Finally, the design joined the rounded turrets of whalebacks into one long and narrow rectangular structure (also called a [...] "turret") of about half the beam, and used that space {{as part of the}} hold.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} more {{conventional}} ironclads, which the Brazilian navy could order from Britain or France, as noted the Americans had invented the monitor, an armoured, shallow draft, <b>turreted</b> <b>vessel</b> that presented little superstructure to enemy fire; monitors could be and were built in Brazil. [...] Thus by the time Lopez II fired the first shots against Brazil (December 1864) the Humaitá defences were obsolescent to the latest naval weaponry that could be manufactured or purchased. [...] Brazil was an enormous country {{and after the war}} broke out it could have (and soon did have) at least 10 ironclads.|$|R
50|$|In hull form, trunk ships resembled <b>turret</b> deck <b>vessels,</b> differing {{mainly in}} {{eliminating}} the curves and joining the above-water horizontal {{part of the}} hull with the vertical strakes and sides of the trunk by right angles. The similarity was such that Doxford, builder and operator of the turret decks, sued Ropners for patent infringement.|$|R
25|$|A turret deck ship {{is a type}} of {{merchant}} ship with an unusual hull, designed and built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The hulls of <b>turret</b> deck <b>vessels</b> were rounded and stepped inward above their waterlines. This gave some advantages in strength and allowed them to pay lower canal tolls under tonnage measurement rules then in effect. The type ceased to be built after those rules changed.|$|R
50|$|In 1962 The Offshore Company {{elected to}} build a new type of drillship, larger than that of the Glomar class. This new drillships would feature a first ever anchor mooring array based on a unique <b>turret</b> system. The <b>vessel</b> was named Discoverer I. The Discoverer I had no main {{propulsion}} engines, meaning they needed to be towed out to the drill site.|$|R
50|$|Both {{ships were}} flush deck {{with only a}} jury rig, and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, {{although}} impressed with Coles' rotating <b>turret,</b> required oceangoing <b>vessels</b> to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.|$|R
2500|$|In side profile, turret deck ships resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with flush decks or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} <b>turret</b> deck <b>vessels</b> and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the vertical side of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area {{was known as the}} harbour deck. Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the s in 1908, the main battery turrets were {{designed}} so as to superfire, to improve fire arcs on centerline mounted weapons. This was necessitated by a need to move all main battery <b>turrets</b> to the <b>vessel's</b> centerline for improved structural support. The 1906 HMS Dreadnought, while revolutionary in many other ways, had retained wing turrets due to concerns about muzzle blast affecting the sighting mechanisms of a turret below.|$|R
25|$|The {{modernization}} work on {{the four}} Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320mm diameter. The middle <b>turret</b> and the <b>vessel's</b> central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters {{were added to the}} ship's length to improve the coefficient of fineness. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the s and the s, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.|$|R
5000|$|The FPSO {{operating}} in the deepest waters is the FPSO BW Pioneer, built and operated by BW Offshore on behalf of Petrobras Americas INC. The FPSO is moored {{at a depth of}} 2,600 m in Block 249 Walker Ridge in the US Gulf of Mexico and is rated for [...] The EPCI contract was awarded in October 2007 and production started in early 2012. The FPSO conversion was carried out at MMHE Shipyard Pasir Gudang in Malaysia, while the topsides were fabricated in modules at various international vendor locations. The FPSO has a disconnectable <b>turret</b> (APL). The <b>vessel</b> can disconnect in advance of hurricanes and reconnect with minimal down time. A contract for an FPSO to operate in even deeper waters (2,900 m) for Shell's Stones field in the US Gulf of Mexico was awarded to SBM Offshore in July 2013.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} on the study and comparison of different mooring/anchoring systems for offshore vessels in deep waters. FPSO’s (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading platforms), Light Weight Intervention vessels (LWI); Semi-submersible platforms and Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU) make use of efficient mooring/anchoring systems to provide {{a connection between the}} floating vessel and the sea bed. If a good mooring/anchoring system is not in place, the offshore vessel can drift off location and consequently cause damage to the vessel, riser, drill pipe and other associated equipment, thereby, compromising the safety of the asset and offshore personnel. Safety of the mooring/anchoring system is essential in order to guarantee successful marine operations. It is pertinent to have a strong mooring/anchoring system in order to secure the vessel against environmental forces and unplanned impact. As offshore technology is moving into deeper and deeper waters, there is an increasing challenge in the design of mooring/anchoring systems for offshore vessels. New technology, concepts, materials and sophisticated models showcasing the interaction between vessels and environment have been introduced. In this thesis, an investigation of the design and characteristics of different mooring/anchoring systems was carried out. The major tasks carried out in this thesis are listed below:  Review of different mooring and anchoring systems for offshore vessels.  Use of OrcaFlex software to perform dynamic analysis of different mooring lines to determine the design criteria for a range of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels.  Performing a SWOT analysis of the mooring line materials.  Calculating different forces and tensions on the mooring lines based on the prevailing environmental conditions in deep waters. The write-up begins with a review of different mooring and anchoring systems for offshore vessels followed by a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of different mooring line materials. A review of the regulations and standards governing the design and installation of mooring systems for offshore applications in different environments was also carried out. Different combination of mooring lines were used in this analysis to secure the vessel in position and the tensions obtained across the arc length of each mooring line are presented in the results. Three mooring line configuration cases were analyzed in this thesis. In the three cases, the offshore vessel is moored with eight symmetric mooring lines spaced 45 ° apart. The mooring lines configuration is Chain-Fiber rope–Chain in Case 1, Wire rope-Chain in Case 2, and Chain-Wire rope-Chain in case 3. The mooring geometry for all the cases is a catenary mooring system. The simulation uses regular waves acting on the vessel for the duration of 115 seconds. The mooring system employs a turret, located at the vessel’s moonpool. Since all mooring lines are connected to the <b>turret,</b> the <b>vessel</b> is free to rotate about the turret-wellhead axis and head into oncoming seas, regardless of direction. Thrusters are provided at the bow and stern to assist in maintaining a desired heading. The chain table connecting the mooring line to the turret is above the waterline. The wave theory used in the analysis is Dean Stream. The vessel used for the modelling is 103 m long and weighs 8800 tonnes. From the analysis carried out, it was observed that the maximum tension occurs at the turret end of the mooring lines. This is {{as a result of the}} vessel motions induced by environmental forces. The tensions obtained in Case 3 are quite high when compared to case 1 and case 2, but are still within acceptable limits as they are less than the minimum breaking loads of the mooring line materials used. It was also observed that Chain impose an enormous weight on the mooring line compared to fiber ropes consequently resulting to increased tension in the lines. The use of synthetic fiber rope in the configuration reduced the mooring weight and increases flexibility, thereby reducing the mooring line tensions. The advantages of each mooring/anchoring system are optimized while dispelling their disadvantages. Recommendations as regards the selection of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels operating in different environments are presented in this report. The results of the dynamic analysis can be used to determine the design criteria for a range of mooring/anchoring systems for different offshore vessels...|$|R
