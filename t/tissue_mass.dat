25|$|Chávez was {{diagnosed}} with cancer following the discovery of a mass in his pelvic region in June 2011. He traveled to Havana, Cuba where he underwent a surgical operation to remove a malignant cancerous <b>tissue</b> <b>mass</b> 'about the size of a baseball' from his waist. He underwent a second surgical operation in Venezuela one month later. Over the next 12 months, he followed a cycle of chemotherapy. The type of cancer Chávez {{was diagnosed}} with was never made public which fueled speculation over his condition (with speculations from being prostate cancer to colon cancer among others). Following the presidential election in October 2012 (where he was re-elected to a fourth term), he went to Cuba for more treatment and then returned to Venezuela and stayed at a Caracas army hospital for one week until his death. Successive announcements of his return and updates of his health were criticised by the country's opposition that the population were unaware of his health and location. The fact that the cancer had metastasised was not made public during the campaign, and strongly denied by Government officers. After the first lung infection (pneumonia) in the last stages of his life, Chávez was intubated nearing the end of December. His breathing worsened until his death was announced at 16:25 VET (20:55 UTC) on 5 March 2013, almost two years after he was first diagnosed.|$|E
2500|$|Radiotherapy {{treatments}} are typically prescribed {{in terms of}} the local absorbed dose, which might be 60Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated (about 2Gy per day for curative treatment), which allows for the normal tissues to undergo repair, allowing it to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected.

Occasionally, however, a patient is referred from a local clinician to our clinic with an inoperable mass following a surgical procedure. We consider it important to fully understand the nature of the mass prior to surgery, thus avoiding unnecessary surgery in some cases. High-resolution ultrasonography has been widely applied in the musculoskeletal system {{over the past two decades}} and is very useful in evaluating the nature of superficial soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses.</b> It enables the differentiation of benign and malignant masses and the detection of many different types of histology in superficial soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses.</b> The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the characteristic findings of high-resolution ultrasonography and color Doppler ultrasonography in superficial soft tissue tumors...|$|R

2500|$|The BMI is {{an attempt}} to {{quantify}} the amount of <b>tissue</b> <b>mass</b> (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value.

[...] Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the WHO cut-off point for overweight, 25kg/m2, although the cutoff for observed risk varies among different Asian populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the contribution of the leg <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> (bone mineral content (BMC), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and wobbling mass (WM)), and muscle activation levels to the response of the tibia following heel impacts similar to those experienced during running. A human pendulum was used to deliver controlled impacts to the dominant foot of 20 males and 20 females (mean age 23. 8 +/- 2. 6 years, body mass 71. 8 +/- 16. 9 kg, and height 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 m). Individual <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> were determined through use of anthropometric prediction equations. External impact forces, tibial accelerations, and tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius activation levels were measured simultaneously with a vertically erected force plate, uniaxial skin mounted accelerometer, and surface EMG electrodes, respectively. Simple linear regression was used to quantify the contribution to the tibial response parameters made by the magnitude of the individual leg <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> and muscle activation levels. The magnitudes of the leg <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> did not account for much variation in the tibial response to impact, and only partial support was found for the role of leg muscular activation levels. As a result, mechanical coupling between the rigid and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses,</b> and thickness of the heel fat pad are likely very important in explaining tibial response following heel impact, and future work addressing this seems warranted.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the imaging findings of Askin tumors on computed tomography (CT) and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Seventeen cases of Askin tumors confirmed by histopathology were retrospectively analyzed in terms of CT (17 cases) and FDG-PET/CT data (6 cases). Fifteen of the tumors were located in the chest wall and the other 2 were in the anterior middle mediastinum. Of the 15 chest wall cases, 13 demonstrated irregular, heterogeneous soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> with cystic degeneration and necrosis, and 2 demonstrated homogeneous soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> on unenhanced CT scans. Two mediastinal tumors demonstrat-ed the irregular, heterogeneous soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses.</b> Calcifications were found in 2 tumors. The tumors demonstrated heterogeneously enhance-ment in 16 cases and homogeneous enhancement in 1 case on contrast-enhanced scans. FDG-PET/CT images revealed increased metabolic activity in all 6 cases undergone FDG-PET/CT scan, and the lesion SUVmax ranged from 4. 0 to 18. 6. At initial diagnosis, CT and FDG-PET/CT scans revealed rib destruction in 9 cases, pleural effusion in 9 cases, and lung metastasis in 1 case. At follow-up, 12 cases showed recurrence and/or metastases, 4 cases showed improvement or remained stable, and 1 was lost to follow-up. In summary, CT and FDG-PET/CT images of Askin tumors showed heterogeneous soft <b>tissue</b> <b>masses</b> in the chest wall and the mediastinum, accompanied by rib destruction, pleural effusion, and increased FDG uptake. CT and FDG-PET/CT imaging play important roles in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Askin tumors...|$|R
