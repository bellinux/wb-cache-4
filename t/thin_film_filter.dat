40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the vulnerability to eavesdropping on-off-keying based OCDMA scheme, a new multi-code keying reconfiguration is presented to enhance confidentiality over two dimensional time-spreading and wavelength-hopping (2 D TS/WH) optical {{code division multiple access}} (OCDMA) schemes. The time-shifted carrier-hopping prime codes (CHPCs) are proposed and assigned as signature address code. This proposed scheme provides the integration of electronic and optical layer domain, which inherently comes from the data encryption and spectrum-spreading of the transmitted signals, and then achieves data-confidential enhancement in synchronous networks. Moreover, multi-code keying reconfiguration in a set of distinct codeword is assigned to individual user and random selection by using <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>filter,</b> tunable delay line and optical switch.

Random diagonal code is constructed using code level and data level. One of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at data level is always zero, which means that Phase Intensity Induced Noise is reduced. We find that the performance of the random diagonal code will be better than modified frequency hopping and Hadamard code. It has been observed through simulation and theoretical calculation that bit-error rate for random diagonal code perform significantly better than other codes. We analyze the performance of the proposed codes and examine how the code size and correlation properties are related.

Results of researches and analyses {{of the development of}} the fixed broadband optical network are summarized. The focus is on describing the migration process of the Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network – GPON to NG-PON 1. The migration to the new technology is sensible only if related to technological improvements that enable enhanced services and if the investments needed for migration are cost-efficient. Arrival of a new technology is always characterized by a certain range of changes in the existing system, therefore, the purpose of the paper is to answer the questions what is the scope of changes needed in the existing passive and active elements and which new elements need to be added. In relation to this, special attention is given to coexistence of GPON and NG-PON 1.

40|$|The hybrid {{integration}} of passive and optoelectronic devices {{has been widely}} researched. One of the main applications of this technique is for the fiber to the home (FTTH) network. In bi-directional transceivers, integrated WDM filters {{have been used to}} separate or combine the optical signals. <b>Thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>filter</b> (TFF) embedded waveguide type is effective for an application requiring wide bandwidth and low loss. Although the insertion loss of TFF itself is quite low, significant loss occurs at the trench and it depends on the geometrical structure and fabrication errors of the trench waveguide. The conventional sawing method and deep reactive ion etching technique were used for trench fabrication. In the case of using DRIE process, fabrication error was reduced and position error of the trench was controlled within 1 µm. This method could also enhance the platform design flexibility. To reduce the coupling loss between input and reflection waveguides with high tolerance of filter position, a few mode waveguide and horn waveguide were proposed. The insertion losses of transmission and reflection were less than 0. 5 dB and 0. 7 dB respectively. The 1 dB tolerance of filter position was improved to be nearly twice than that of the conventional waveguide...|$|E

40|$|A {{demodulation}} {{scheme is}} presented for a hybrid sensing {{system based on}} a polarimetric fiber sensor and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for composite structural health monitoring (SHM). The demodulation module is comprised of a <b>Thin</b> <b>Film</b> <b>Filter</b> Wavelength Division Demultiplexer (TFF WDM- Demux) and an Electro-optic (EO) modulator. Unlike 2 ̆ 2 laboratory-use 2 ̆ 2 demodulation systems which typically do not need a compact form factor, the proposed miniaturized demodulation system is compact, lightweight and has low power consumption. The bandpass responses of the TFF WDM- Demux are designed to match the peak reflected wavelengths of the FBGs so that the differential wavelength information {{can be converted to}} intensity variations recorded by the array of detectors connected to the output channels of the TFF WDM- Demux. In the polarimetric sensor demodulation section of the system, an electrical control voltage is applied to the electro-optic modulator in order to shift the polarimetric sensor output to the maximum sensitive linear response region. Two types of polarimetric fiber sensors are used; a Panda fiber and a polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber. The polarimetric strain sensors provide the average strain and temperature information, while the fiber Bragg grating sensors give localized strain information. The demodulation system uniquely allows for the multiple outputs of FBG and polarimetric sensors to be converted to a common optical intensity domain, for strain and temperature measurements. 2012 SPIE...|$|E

In {{view of the fact}} that no previous studies have been made on potential radiation damage of these materials in the thin film format, we report on such an assessment here. Transmittances and reflectances of BaF 2, CaF 2, HfO 2, LaF 3, MgF 2, and SiO 2 thin films on MgF 2 substrates, Al 2 O 3 thin films on fused silica substrates, uncoated fused silica and MgF 2, and four multilayer filters made from these materials were measured from 120 nm to 180 nm before and after irradiation by 250 krads from a Co- 60 gamma radiation source. No radiation-induced losses in transmittance or reflectance occurred in this wavelength range. Additional postradiation measurements from 160 nm to 300 nm indicated a 3 - 5 % radiation-induced absorption near 260 nm in some of the samples with MgF 2 substrates.

40|$|Embedded {{metrology}} is {{the provision}} of metrology on the manufacturing platform, enabling measurement without {{the removal of the}} work piece. Providing closer integration of metrology upon the manufacturing platform can lead to the better control and increased throughput. In this work we present the development of a high precision hybrid optical chip interferometer metrology device. The complete metrology sensor system is structured into two parts; optical chip and optical probe. The hybrid optical chip interferometer is based on a silica-on-silicon etched integrated-optic motherboard containing waveguide structures and evanescent couplers. Upon the motherboard, electro-optic components such as photodiodes and a semiconductor gain block are mounted and bonded to provide the required functionality. The key structure in the device is a tunable laser module based upon an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL). Within the cavity is a multi-layer <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>filter</b> which is rotated to select the longitudinal mode at which the laser operates. An optical probe, which uses a blazed diffracting grating and collimating objective lens, focuses light of different wavelengths laterally over the measurand. Incident laser light is then tuned in wavelength time to effectively sweep an ‘optical stylus’ over the surface. Wavelength scanning and rapid phase shifting can then retrieve the path length change and thus the surface height. We give an overview of the overall design of the final hybrid photonic chip interferometer, constituent components, device integration and packaging as well as experimental test results from the current version now under evaluation. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
