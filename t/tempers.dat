5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. <b>Tempers</b> flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E

5|$|In the League Cup, {{the clubs}} {{met in the}} quarter-final stage at Old Trafford in December and even though both sides fielded {{weakened}} teams, the match was not short of drama. David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that <b>tempers</b> began to flare. A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from both sets of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match official Mark Halsey. The game finished 1–0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match <b>tempers</b> boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E

He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing <b>tempers</b> to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E
50|$|Differential <b>tempering</b> (also called graded <b>tempering,</b> {{selective}} <b>tempering</b> {{or local}} <b>tempering)</b> is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential <b>tempering</b> begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for <b>tempering</b> cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously <b>tempering</b> the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|R

Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to run down the clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays.

5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even <b>tempers</b> Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As <b>tempers</b> rose over the Home Rule Bill, which {{would never have been}} possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 in an attempt to negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>temper</b> {{embrittlement}} is possible {{to occur in the}} HAZ of 1 1 / 4 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo steel.

5|$|The Doctor, Ian, and Barbara {{are still}} missing the Doctor's granddaughter Susan when the TARDIS lands on a planet the Doctor {{eventually}} recognises as Dido, a world he has visited before. The trio soon encounter two survivors of a space crash, Vicki and Bennett, who are awaiting a rescue ship that is due to arrive in three days time. Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion, a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was amongst those who died when {{the survivors of the}} crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, <b>tempers</b> are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it.|$|E
5|$|Two so {{dissimilar}} {{painters and}} <b>tempers</b> as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists. During {{most of the}} 1910s this term was used {{in a number of}} contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the Herwarth Walden gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, Schwedishe Expressionisten (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists. Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm. The rest of the participants were Isaac Grunewald, Edward Hald, GAN and Sigrid Hjertén. In the autumn of 1915, Jolin and GAN held a joint exhibition in Lund University's art museum. Despite their differences, their friendship continued during GAN's years in Stockholm (1916–1919). Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, a sentiment shared by GAN. Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, not in the way GAN {{and other members of the}} group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet in his paintings.|$|E

40|$|Background:  <b>Temper</b> outbursts {{in youth}} with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) {{are a common}} source of concern, but remain poorly understood. This study examined a set of hypotheses related to: (a) the prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts in paediatric OCD, (b) the associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with OCD severity and depressive symptoms; and (c) the influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response. Methods:  The prevalence of <b>temper</b> outbursts was estimated in a specialist OCD clinical sample (n = 387) using parent- and child-report. This was replicated in a community sample (n = 18, 415). Associations of <b>temper</b> outbursts with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and with depressed mood were examined using logistic regression models. The influence of <b>temper</b> outbursts on treatment response was examined in a subsample of 109 patients treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with or without medication. Results:  Over a third of young people with OCD displayed <b>temper</b> outbursts, and rates were similar across the clinical and community samples. <b>Temper</b> outbursts were {{two to three times}} more common in youth with OCD than in healthy controls. However, OCD symptom severity was not a strong predictor of child- or parent-reported <b>temper</b> outbursts. Instead, both child- and parent- reported <b>temper</b> outbursts were significantly associated to depressive symptoms. CBT strongly reduced OCD and depressive symptoms, as well as the severity of <b>temper</b> outbursts. There {{was no significant difference in}} post-treatment OCD or depression scores between those with <b>temper</b> outbursts compared to those without. Conclusions:  <b>Temper</b> outbursts are common in youth with OCD and are particularly related to depressed mood. They improve with CBT for OCD and do not seem to impede OCD treatment response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Temper</b> {{modulation}} {{problems are}} both {{a hallmark of}} early childhood and a common mental health concern. Thus, characterizing specific behavioral manifestations of <b>temper</b> loss along a dimension from normative misbehaviors to clinically significant problems {{is an important step}} toward identifying clinical thresholds. Methods Parent-reported patterns of <b>temper</b> loss were delineated in a diverse community sample of preschoolers (n = 1, 490). A developmentally sensitive questionnaire, the Multidimensional Assessment of Preschool Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB), was used to assess <b>temper</b> loss in terms of tantrum features and anger regulation. Specific aims were: (a) document the normative distribution of <b>temper</b> loss in preschoolers from normative misbehaviors to clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors, and test for sociodemographic differences; (b) use Item Response Theory (IRT) to model a <b>Temper</b> Loss dimension; and (c) examine associations of <b>temper</b> loss and concurrent emotional and behavioral problems. Results Across sociodemographic subgroups, a unidimensional <b>Temper</b> Loss model fit the data well. Nearly all (83. 7 %) preschoolers had tantrums sometimes but only 8. 6 % had daily tantrums. Normative misbehaviors occurred more frequently than clinically concerning <b>temper</b> loss behaviors. Milder behaviors tended to reflect frustration in expectable contexts, whereas clinically concerning problem indicators were unpredictable, prolonged, and/or destructive. In multivariate models, <b>Temper</b> Loss was associated with emotional and behavioral problems. Conclusions Parent reports on a developmentally informed questionnaire, administered to a large and diverse sample, distinguished normative and problematic manifestations of preschool <b>temper</b> loss. A developmental, dimensional approach shows promise for elucidating the boundaries between normative early childhood <b>temper</b> loss and emergent psychopathology...|$|R
