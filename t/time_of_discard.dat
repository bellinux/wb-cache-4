40|$|Unpredictability in {{the arrival}} <b>time</b> and {{quantity}} <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> products at product recovery facilities (PRFs) and varying demand for recovered components {{contribute to the}} volatility in their inventory levels. Achieving profit under such capricious inventory levels and stringent environmental legislations remains a challenge to many PRFs. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision model to determine a pricing policy that can simultaneously address two issues: stabilize inventory fluctuations and boost profits. The model considers that PRFs passively accepts discarded products as well as acquires them proactively if necessary. Under a multi-criteria setting, the current work determines prices of reusable and recyclable components to maximize revenue and minimize product recovery costs. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the multi-criteria decision making problem. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of sorting yield, disassembly yield, and reusable component yield on the profits, prices, inventory levels, and disposal quantities.

The average fishing speed was about 5 knots. The fishing {{area of the}} four trips was east of the coast of England and fishing depth was 36 m on average with a minimum depth of 20 m and a maximum depth of 46 m. For this study the standard sampling procedure for the yearly monitoring <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> <b>of</b> conventional beam trawl fleet was applied (van Helmond and van Overzee, 2008). Sampled numbers of fish per haul were raised to numbers and weight per hour, for both.

40|$|This Ph. D. project {{involved}} {{the design and}} construction of an infra red based fast response carbon monoxide sensor. Several gas sensing techniques {{for the detection of}} carbon monoxide and other gases are discussed and a summary of their potential use for the measurement of the transfer factor is given. The development of the overall sensor design is presented, and the performance of its various components and the resulting sensor are discussed. The feasibility of a new gas cell design with spherical geometry was investigated, especially with respect to its potential use for measuring with high resolution (< 200 ppm CO) and fast time response (< 300 ms). Analytical models for the sensor designs investigated are also described and compared to experimental results. The sensor was primarily designed for use in pulmonary function laboratories, in particular, for the measurement of the transfer factor of the lungs. This measurement can indicate potential dysfunction of the respiratory gas transfer across the alveoli–capillary membrane, e. g. emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. However, in contrast to the traditional steady state measurement of the transfer factor, which is prone to errors (e. g. correct determination <b>of</b> breath holding <b>time,</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> volume <b>of</b> exhaled breath, etc [...] .), it was proposed to perform a real time measurement. Finally, the instrument was evaluated using volunteers performing the single breath test in a clinical environment. These tests demonstrated the possible use of the fast response sensor in a clinical environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: The {{implementation}} of quality system and continuous evaluation of all {{activities of the}} Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) can help to achieve the maximum {{quantity and quality of}} safe blood. Optimizing blood collection and processing would reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> and improve the efficiency of the BTS. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the rate <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> <b>of</b> blood and blood component and identify its reasons at the National Blood Centre (NBC), Kuala Lumpur, during the year of 2007 in order to introduce appropriate intervention. Study Designs and Methods: Data on the number <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> whole blood units and its components, reasons for discard, and the number of blood components processed as well as the number of collected blood units were obtained from the Blood Bank Information System - NBC database. These were analyzed. Results: The total number of blood units collected in 2007 was 171169 from which 390636 units of components were prepared. The total number <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> whole blood units and its components was 8968 (2. 3 %). Platelet concentrate recorded the highest <b>of</b> <b>discard</b> at 6 % (3909) followed by whole blood at 3. 7 % (647), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at 2. 5 % (2839), and cryoprecipitate at 2 % (620). The rate <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> packed red blood cells RBCs, plasma aphaeresis, and PLT aphaeresis was less than 1 % at 0. 6 % (902), 0. 6 % (37), and 0. 29 % (14), respectively.

40|$|Monitoring {{live and}} dead {{discarded}} catch contributes to effective fisheries management and ecological and socioeconomic sustainability. We determined contemporary rates and levels <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries. An estimated 265 279 t (52 283 to 478 275 t 95 % CI) is annually discarded by global tuna fisheries, composing about 5 % {{of the weight}} of the total catch. Pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries contributed about 64 and 36 % <b>of</b> <b>discards,</b> respectively. Other gear types composed < 1 % <b>of</b> <b>discards.</b> Discards in tuna fisheries are now 63 % lower than estimated 1 decade earlier, mainly due to large declines in discards in longline tuna fisheries, possibly from increased retention <b>of</b> formerly <b>discarded</b> species and sizes of catch and increased gear selectivity. The decline also resulted, in part, from employing different methods to categorize caught sharks whose fins were retained and carcasses discarded following processing. Discard rates were greater in shallow-than deep-set longline fisheries, and higher in purse seine sets associated with fish aggregating devices and other floating objects than in other purse seine set types. The quality and availability <b>of</b> data on <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries were extremely limited. Filling gaps in monitoring, improving observer data fields and collection protocols, and providing public access to amalgamated discard data held by fisheries management organizations will improve the certainty <b>of</b> future <b>discard</b> estimates, supporting effective management <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> in global tuna fisheries...|$|R

40|$|There {{is great}} {{variation}} in discarding practice among fisheries {{in different parts}} of the world. Management systems result in some fisheries discarding mostly fish offal, much of which is macerated into small chunks, while other fisheries discard large (ca. 25 cm) whole fish. Scavenging seabirds consume high proportions of most categories <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> fish and offal (typically 60 to 80 % <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> roundfish, 70 to 95 % <b>of</b> <b>discarded</b> offal), but tend to avoid discarded benthic invertebrates and fish that are difficult to swallow, such as species with long spines or large flatfish. Amounts and composition <b>of</b> fishery <b>discards</b> and offal reaching benthic scavenging communities are clearly very strongly influenced by the intense but selective consumption by seabirds, and this alteration will depend strongly on details of the fishery management regulations and customs, such as whether or not waste is macerated.

40|$|Discards {{generated}} from marine fisheries have significantly affected species populations and community composition of seabirds through mechanisms such as competition, predator–prey interactions and nutrient transfer. Our {{understanding of the}} fate <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> beyond seabird scavenging is fragmented, but {{it is likely that}} similar mechanisms come into play. This study contributes in resolving this knowledge gap by quantifying the amount and composition <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> that become available to scavengers other than seabirds. The key was nevertheless found in revealing seabird discard consumption, as seabirds are likely the first in taking profit <b>of</b> fishery <b>discards</b> due to their high mobility. Their selective consumption determines the composition and amount of food remaining for others. The consumption <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> by scavenging seabirds was assessed for the French fishing fleet in the Bay of Biscay. Experimental sea trials were conducted to assess the proportion <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> consumed by foraging guild and discard type. Experimental discard consumption (EDC) was raised to fleet level by foraging guild using the total number <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> by discard type. The raising procedure accounted for the spatio-temporal variability of both foraging guilds and discards, by standardising both distributions to their lowest common resolution. Discards limited inferences in space, whilst the highest temporal resolution was determined by the biennial monitoring of foraging guilds. As EDC of roundfish by Large gulls and Gannets varied considerably, we investigated the main drivers. Consumption increased logarithmically with the number of ship followers for both guilds, but was greatly impaired by competitors for Large gulls. Competition between Large gulls and Gannets reduced the roundfish consumption by threefold, while other guilds such as Kittiwakes, Procellariids and Skuas had only a limited though significant influence. As Large gulls dominated during the first semester (April to September), the consumption <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> and notably roundfish was dictated by this foraging guild. The abundance of ship following Gannets was remarkably higher in the second semester (October to March). This change in flock composition and in numbers of ship followers implied an increase in the consumed proportion of roundfish of 27. 9 %. The total number <b>of</b> <b>discards</b> that became available to non-avian scavengers was however higher in the first semester, as more discards were produced during this period. Most discards comprised benthic invertebrates, but excluding this discard type revealed that over two thirds <b>of</b> the <b>discards</b> remained roundfish...|$|R
