40|$|Industry is {{currently}} seeking rapid methods {{to verify the}} accuracy of five-axis machine tools (5 A-MTs) throughout their operational life. The ballbar has previously been reported as a tool used to identify position-independent geometric errors within the rotary axes of 5 A-MTs. At present, {{a minimum of two}} separate ballbar <b>testing</b> <b>set-ups</b> are necessary to identify eight error sources inherent to two rotary axes.

Such guided waves are widely used in structural health monitoring and nondestructive evaluation, but methods of calibrating piezoelectric detectors have been inadequate. This study relied on laser interferometry for the base displacement measurement of bar waves, from which eight different guided wave <b>test</b> <b>set-ups</b> are developed with known wave motion using piezoelectric transmitters. Both plates and bars of 12. 7 and 6. 4 mm thickness were used as wave propagation media. The upper frequency limit was 2 MHz. Output of guided wave detectors were obtained on the <b>test</b> <b>set-ups</b> and their receiving sensitivities were characterized and averaged. While each sensitivity spectrum was noisy for a detector, the averaged spectrum showed a good convergence to a unique receiving sensitivity. Twelve detectors were evaluated and their sensitivity spectra determined in absolute units. Generally, these showed rapidly dropping sensitivity with increasing frequency due to waveform cancellation on their sensing areas. This effect contributed to vastly different sensitivities to guided wave and to normally incident wave for {{each one of the}} 12 detectors tested.
