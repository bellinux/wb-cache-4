25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Thomson later {{recognized}} {{those aspects}} as {{being part of}} Altman's style, beginning with MASH (1970): [...] "MASH began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom {{that there was no}} sense of composition. That is what makes Nashville so absorbing." [...] Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: [...] "If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be talking." [...] Pauline Kael writes that Altman, [...] "the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that [...] [...] [...] he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing." ...|$|E

Thus, within your State you will have two great parties under arms, neither of which can be called your own. Unless you stir yourself, and quickly, unless you choose now between friends and foes, you will find yourself alone, isolated, in grave peril, without authority or power." ...|$|E

6000|$|Theseus {{went with}} Medea into her {{fragrant}} chamber, and they spake {{a few words}} together.

They will attack the palace just before the dawn. Now I will go through the town, and secretly call the trusty men to arm and come to defend the palace, telling them that the son of Ægeus, the man who cleared the ways, is with us. And do you take your chariot, and drive speedily to the sons of Phytalus, and bring all their spears, chariot men and foot men, and place them in ambush around the village of Gargettus, where one band of the Pallantidæ will lie to-night till dawn. The rest you know.' ...|$|E

"All {{attempts}} {{to mingle with}} the common people and became permanently one of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to fail, unless I {{can get rid of}} it, disappear from it, and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name. I am astonished and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are to get acquainted with a lord, and how diligent they are in pushing attentions upon him. They lack English servility, it is true--but they could acquire it, with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way. I write my family name without additions, on the register of this hotel, and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer, but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front! show his lordship to four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it. This sort of thing shall cease at once. I will hunt up the American Claimant the first thing in the morning, accomplish my mission, then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was their}} oldest boy whom my {{boy and his}} brother chiefly went with before that boy who knew about [...] "Monte Cristo" [...] came to learn the trade in their father's office. One Saturday in July they three spent the whole day together. It was just {{the time when the}} apples are as big as walnuts on the trees, and a boy wants to try whether any of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be sweet or not. The boys tried a great many of them, in an old orchard thrown open for building-lots behind my boy's yard; but they could not find any that were not sour; or that they could eat till they thought of putting salt on them; if you put salt on it, you could eat any kind of green apple, whether {{it was going to be}} a sweet kind or not. They went up to the Basin bank and got lots of salt out of the holes in the barrels lying there, and then they ate all the apples they could hold, and after that they cut limber sticks off the trees, and {{sharpened}} the points, and stuck apples on them and threw them. You could send an apple almost out of sight that way, and you could scare a dog almost as far as you could see him.|$|E
