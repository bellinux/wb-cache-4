40|$|AbstractLet K be a field, charK= 0. We {{study the}} {{polynomial}} identities satisfied by Z 2 -graded <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of T-prime algebras. Regev and Seeman proved {{that in a}} series of cases such <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> are PI equivalent to T-prime algebras; they conjectured that this is always the case. We deal here with the remaining cases and thus confirm Regev and Seeman's conjecture. For some “small” algebras we can remove the restriction on the characteristic of the base field, and we show that the behaviour of the corresponding graded <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> is quite similar to that for the usual (ungraded) <b>tensor</b> <b>products.</b> Finally we consider β-graded <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> (also called commutation factors) and their identities. We show that Regev's A⊗B theorem holds for β-graded <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> whenever the gradings are by finite abelian groups. Furthermore we study the PI equivalence of β-graded <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of T-prime algebras...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tensor</b> <b>products</b> of modules of {{a finite}} group occur {{in many areas}} of {{ordinary}} and modular representation theory. In general only {{little is known about the}} structure of these modules. This thesis is about various aspects of <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of modules of symmetric groups S_n over a field of prime characteristic p. The main focus lies on some special indecomposable summands of such <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> and the complete decomposition into indecomposable summands of certain <b>tensor</b> <b>products.</b> Simple modules and trivial source modules are mainly focused. For instance we will look at <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of Young modules. We introduce the generalized sign sgn_n^q. We will show that this class function of S_n is a generalized character. We give an application of sgn_n^q to <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of Young modules. Additionally, we determine in some cases the set of irreducible constituents of sgn_n^q. We will although look at <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of the simple natural module and simple modules corresponding to hook partitions. We show that some of these products are semi-simple or indecomposable. Over a field of characteristic two we will determine the simple constituents of the tensor square of the basic spin module.

As a corollary of this bound, we obtain a simple and asymptotically correct approximation for the number of real critical points of a generic sl_ 2 master function. We obtain a formula for multiplicity space signatures in <b>tensor</b> <b>products</b> of finite dimensional simple U_q(sl_ 2) representations.
