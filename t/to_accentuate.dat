5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, but the overall tendency <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> the positive lives on, or has indeed grown stronger.|$|E
5|$|The flame robin is territorial, {{defending}} {{its territory}} against {{other members of}} its species and also scarlet robins where they co-occur. In Nimmitabel in southern New South Wales, migratory flame robins invaded and eked out their territories from amid existing scarlet robin territories. Once settled, however, no species dominated over the other and stable boundaries emerged. The flame robin deploys a number of agonistic displays, including a breast-puffing display where it puffs its breast feathers and a white spot display where it puffs its feathers <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> its frontal white crown, white wing markings or white outer tail feathers. They may also fly at intruders or sing to defend their territory.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E

50|$|Human health impacts include {{significant}} numbers of gastrointestinal illness each year, although death from one overflow event is uncommon. Additional human impacts include beach closures, swimming restrictions and prohibition of the consumption of certain aquatic animals (particularly certain molluscs) after overflow events. Ecological consequences include fish kills, harm to plankton and other aquatic microflora and microfauna. Turbidity increase and dissolved oxygen decrease in receiving waters can lead <b>to</b> <b>accentuated</b> effects beyond the obvious pathogenic induced damage to aquatic ecosystems. It is possible that higher life forms such as marine mammals can be affected since certain seals and sea lions are known to experience peaks in pathogenic harm.|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{synovial}} cells {{grown in}} vitro demonstrated: a) increased rate of lactate formation, b) increased rate of glucose uptake, c) increased rate of hyaluronate synthesis, d) decreased sensitivity to exogenous activator and e) increased concentrations of an endogenous activator. Exogenous activator {{was shown to}} be capable of inducing cortisol unresponsiveness in relation to suppression of hyaluronate synthesis. Evidence that exogenous activator is not long retained by synovial cells suggests that elevated levels in rheumatoid cells are due <b>to</b> <b>accentuated</b> endogenous formation. Elevated activator peptide content of rheumatoid synovial cells provides an explanation for many of the differences between normal and rheumatoid synovial cells in vitro...|$|R
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} the American b-film scenarist, Richard Landau, and heavily revised by Val Guest, {{presents}} a heavily compressed version {{of the events of}} the original television serial. The most significant plot change occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film, Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation and of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of realism, directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel. The film was shot on location in London, Windsor and Bray and at Hammer's Bray Studios. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey, who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an alien appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by Les Bowie. The music was composed by James Bernard, the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.|$|E

Between the green area of the park and the two monuments is the outdoors acoustic amphitheater known as La Concha Acustica (English: The Acoustic Shell) which completes the park in its triangular city block.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Applications {{structured}} as parallel task graphs exhibit both {{data and}} task parallelism, and arise in many domains. Scheduling these applications on parallel platforms {{has been a}} long-standing challenge. In {{the case of a}} single homogeneous cluster, most of the existing algorithms focus on the reduction of the application completion time (makespan). But in presence of resource managers such as batch schedulers and due <b>to</b> <b>accentuated</b> pressure on energy concerns, the produced schedules also have to be efficient in terms of resource usage. In this paper we propose a novel bi-criteria algorithm, called biCPA, able to optimize these two performance metrics either simultaneously or separately. Using simulation over a wide range of experimental scenarios, we find that biCPA leads to better results than previously published algorithms. I...|$|R

25|$|Change in the {{direction}} of the axis rotation (precession) should not be pronounced. In itself, precession need not affect habitability as it changes {{the direction}} of the tilt, not its degree.

500|$|In {{reproducing}} a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies {{by reducing}} the composition to primary colors, which serves <b>to</b> <b>accentuates</b> its mass appeal and largely gives it the [...] "pop" [...] look. Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce {{a variety of colors}} by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of different colors, like an ink jet printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using {{only a limited number of}} primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe ongoing {{globalisation}} {{process has}} not {{put an end}} to international financial crises.

In this context, the main objective of the present study is to establish whether the values of the best-known and most widely used country risk indexes, namely, the Euromoney index and the International Country Risk Group (ICRG), and the values of their representative variables could have forecasted well in advance the crises that took place between 1994 and 2002, a period which is herein termed the ‘globalisation era’. The results show that, although the selected indexes and their representative variables were able to identify certain vulnerabilities, they could not accurately identify the political, economic, and/or financial factors that developed prior to these crisis episodes...|$|R

25|$|Between his two Overtures on Russian Themes, Balakirev became {{involved}} with folk song collecting and arranging. This work alerted him to {{the frequency of the}} Dorian mode, the tendency for many melodies to swing between the major key and its relative minor on its flat seventh key, and the tendency <b>to</b> <b>accentuate</b> notes not consistent with dominant harmony.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is now a}} common reality {{in most parts of}} the world, being translated in mass unemployment, collapse of the social system and an impressive number of bankruptcies. The paper focuses on the beginning of the recession in the American real estate sector by analyzing the implications of imperfect information and moral hazard as main factors that contributed to the deterioration of real estate market and also <b>to</b> <b>accentuating</b> the overall poor economic situation. In that context, asymmetric information served the interests of banks and other institutional speculators who made use of it in order to increase their profitability through market manipulation. The central aspect the paper underlines is the international contamination created by disguising toxic real estate actives and spreading them throughout the global economy through transactions with foreign business partners. asymmetric information; moral hazard; adverse selection; real estate market. ...|$|R
