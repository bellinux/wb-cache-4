5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower {{than what is}} recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E

5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, {{have been shown to}} be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that {{all he wanted was}} {{to send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{dominance}} hierarchies {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> close bonds with each other.|$|E
5|$|While not {{uncommon}} in predominantly Catholic cultures, Christian metal is rooted in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E

25|$|The fishery of Antarctic krill is on {{the order}} of 100,000tonnes per year. The major {{catching}} nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.|$|E

25|$|One {{aspect of}} Sierra Leone that {{is alleged to}} have aided the disease, is the strong desire of many <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> {{involved}} funeral practices. For example, for the Kissi people who inhabit part of Sierra Leone, it is important to bury the bodies of the dead near them. Funeral practices include rubbing the corpses down with oil, dressing them in fine clothes, then having those at the funeral hug and kiss the dead body. This may aid the transmission of Ebola, because those that die from Ebola disease are thought to have high concentrations of the virus in their body, even after they have died.|$|E
25|$|A non-programmed {{theory of}} mammal ageing that fits with {{classical}} evolution theory and Medawar's concept is that different mammal species possess different capabilities for maintenance and repair. Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative {{processes that are}} each more effective than those of shorter-lived species. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, had less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are {{a wide variety of}} ageing manifestations that appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.|$|E
