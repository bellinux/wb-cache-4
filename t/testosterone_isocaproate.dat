50|$|Testosterone {{decanoate}} (BAN) is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester. It is or {{has been a}} component of Sustanon, along with testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, and <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate.</b> Testosterone decanoate has been investigated as a potential long-acting injectable male contraceptive.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone caproate, or {{testosterone}} hexanoate, is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester {{that is no}} longer marketed. It was formerly available as a component of Omnadren 250, along with <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate,</b> testosterone phenylpropionate, and testosterone propionate, but this formulation has since been discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Estradiol {{phenylpropionate}} (EPP), {{also known}} as estradiol 17β-phenylpropionate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen. It is the phenylpropionate ester of estradiol. EPP is marketed in combination with estradiol benzoate under the brand name Dimenformon Prolongatum in the Netherlands and in combination with estradiol benzoate, testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, and <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate</b> under the brand name Mixogen (a balanced mixture of estradiol and testosterone esters).http://home.intekom.com/pharm/donmed/mixogen.html Both of these drug combinations are long-acting injectables indicated in hormone replacement therapy for women in menopause. Dimenformon Prolongatum has also been investigated as a single injection, [...] "morning after" [...] post-coital contraceptive, and is additionally used {{as a component of}} hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
40|$|Anabolic steroids are {{currently}} very controversial issue {{not only for}} its therapeutic use but especially because of the illegal abuse in the sport branch. The aim of this thesis was to develop a rapid, selective, effective and simple method of high performance liquid chromatography suitable for the determination of anabolic steroids in injectable dosage form. The analyzed sample of pharmaceutical product Sustamed contained four testosterone esters: testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate</b> and testosterone decanoate. Optimized HPLC-DAD conditions suitable for determination of the selected testosterone esters were as follows: core-shell column Poroshell HPH-C 18 (3. 0 x 100 mm, 2. 7 mm), mobile phase consisted of 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate, pH 4. 5 and acetonitrile, gradient elution was used. The column was thermostated at 50 řC, injection volume was 1 µl, flow rate was set at 1 ml/min and UV detection at 240 nm. Total analysis time was 6 minutes. Key words anabolic steroids, testosterone esters, HPLC-DA...|$|E
40|$|Sustanon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anabolic androgenic drugs to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength. This drug is a blend of four esterized testosterone derivatives: Testosterone propionate, testosterone phenylpropionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate</b> and testosterone decanoate. Little is known about the effects of this drug on skeletal muscle at the cellular level. This study aimed to investigate the influence of Sustanon on the morphology of skeletal muscle fibers and the distribution of myogenic stem cells known as Satellite Cells (SCs) during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that Sustanon-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with an increase in the number of SCs. Robust immunocytochemical techniques and morphometric analyses were used to calculate the numbers of SCs and myonuclei within the pectoralis muscle of chickens. Also, DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein levels were measured to confirm immunocytochemical findings. Sustanon significantly increased pectoralis mass and fiber size. All SC indices and the number of myonuclei increased significantly by Sustanon administration. In addition, greater DNA concentration and Pax 7 protein expression were found in Sustanon-treated birds. This study indicates that Sustanon can induce avian skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that this is correlated with increased numbers of SCs and myonuclei...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Anabolic {{androgenic}} steroids (AAS) {{are widely}} misused for {{the enhancement of}} performance in sports. Several drugs are available that contain different combinations or individual steroids in different dosage form. This paper describes a TLC densitometric method for simultaneous determination of four AAS of testosterone derivatives including testosterone propionate (TP), testosterone phenyl propionate (TPP), <b>testosterone</b> <b>isocaproate</b> (TI) and testosterone deaconate (TD) in their pharmaceutical products. Results Separation was carried out on Al based TLC plates, pre-coated with silica gel 60 F- 254 using hexane and ethyl acetate (8. 5 : 1. 5, v/v). Spots at R f 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 01, 0. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 01, 0. 40 [*]±[*] 0. 01 and 0. 45 [*]±[*] 0. 02 were recognized as TPP, TP, TI and TD, respectively. Quantitative analysis was done by densitometric measurements at λ max 251 nm for all derivatives. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines. Method was found linear over the concentration range of 200 – 1200 ng/spot with the correlation coefficient of 0. 995, 0. 993, 0. 995 and 0. 996 for TP, TPP, TI, TD, respectively. Limit of detection for all derivatives were {{in the range of}} 16. 7 - 22. 3 ng/spot while limit of quantitation were found to be in the range of 55. 7 - 70. 9 ng/spot. Conclusions The developed TLC method can be applied for the simultaneous routine analysis of testosterone derivatives in their individual and combined pharmaceutical formulations. </p...|$|E
