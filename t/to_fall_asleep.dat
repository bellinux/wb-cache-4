5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series. An alien causes {{the entire population of}} the UK <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in order to execute a bizarre plan. This idea later formed the basis for The Empty Planet.|$|E
5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E
50|$|A nightcap is an {{alcoholic}} beverage consumed prior <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Traditional nightcaps include brandy, bourbon, and cream-based liqueurs such as Irish cream. Wine and beer can also function as nightcaps.|$|R
50|$|Most abductees report {{being taken}} from their bedroom prior <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Typically, {{at the onset}} of the {{abduction}} experience, the abductee will report paralysis, sighting a bright light, and the appearance of humanoid figures.|$|R

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
50|$|In February 2014, Procter & Gamble used HRA {{to survey}} doctors about patients’ sleep struggles, stating that 57 percent of doctors polled {{reported}} one of patients’ biggest hindrances <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> is engaging in electronics {{too close to}} bedtime.|$|R
5000|$|... “Frühlingsnacht” (Spring Night)- Poem by Hermann Hesse. The fifth {{movement}} begins {{quietly as}} it builds to an English horn solo. The baritone is again featured. The text depicts a night {{scene in which}} the speaker observes trees prior <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{title is}} not an amalgam of the film, Saturday Night Fever (1977), and the medical condition, palsy, {{but it is a}} {{reference}} to radial neuropathy, commonly known as [...] "Saturday Night Palsy", a condition akin <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> on your arm.|$|R
5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E

In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent mindfulness which can even lead <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> in meditation without even realising it!" ...|$|R

5|$|Amy starts {{working for}} Leyla and {{develops}} feelings for David, who pays her attention. Amy sleeps with Cain {{and tries to}} make David jealous. When Alicia steals £500 worth of stock, Leyla accuses Amy but David defends her and Alicia admits it was her. Amy kisses David on the cheek {{to thank him for}} his support and misinterpreting his concern, makes further advances but runs away after David rejects her. When she comes home, she blackmails David and tells Victoria that she slept with him but later admits that she lied. Amy, Val and Eric move into their new home at the barn conversion but her happiness is short-lived as a young man from her past, Jared, tracks her down. He threatens to tell her new family and friends about her past and demands money to keep quiet until Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) intervenes, realizing something is wrong. She tells Zak about her past and makes him promise to keep quiet. She pays Jared but when threatened by Zak, he reveals that Amy's affair with his father caused his family to break down. Zak makes Jared leave but Amy discovers she is pregnant and tells Cain, who demands she have a termination. Victoria suggests Amy tell Val but at the clinic, learns that her pregnancy is too advanced for a termination and the baby is due in December. She tells Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) about the baby but insists that Belle keep it secret, scared of Cain's reaction. Amy gives birth to a baby boy in the church graveyard. Thinking he is dead, Amy wraps him in her jumper before leaving him in a telephone box and goes to David's house. She tells him what has happened and he learns that the baby has been found alive and taken to hospital. Knowing Amy needs medical attention, he waits for her <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> and calls an ambulance, Val and Eric. At the hospital, she apologizes for keeping her pregnancy a secret and initially decides to keep the baby, now named Kyle, delighting Val and Eric. On Christmas Day 2011, Amy is bathing Kyle but freezes when she remembers her mother dropping her in the bath and giving her to social services. Amy runs away, leaving Kyle with Val, and confides in Victoria who helps her decide to give Kyle up for adoption. Val is upset by Amy's decision and that Eric is supporting her, making them drift apart. Val tries to win Amy back with a family trip to Portugal but goes alone and clears the bank account. Amy is upset when Eric begins dating Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and attempts to keep them apart; however, she realizes how happy Brenda makes Eric and supports the relationship.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxical {{intention}} is a cognitive reframing technique where the insomniac, instead of attempting <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> at night, makes {{every effort to}} stay awake (i.e. essentially stops trying <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep).</b> One theory that may explain {{the effectiveness of this}} method is that by not voluntarily making oneself go to sleep, it relieves the performance anxiety that arises from the need or requirement <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> which is meant to be a passive act. This technique has been shown to reduce sleep effort and performance anxiety and also lower subjective assessment of sleep-onset latency and overestimation of the sleep deficit (a quality found in many insomniacs).|$|E

25|$|A 2012 review {{focused on}} {{antidepressants}} and sleep {{found that in}} many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, mirtazapine reduces {{the time it takes}} <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> and increases the quality of sleep, but that in some people it can disturb sleep, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people, and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder.|$|E
25|$|Sleep in {{aging is}} another equally {{important}} area of research. A common observation {{is that many}} older adults spend time awake in bed after sleep onset in an inability <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> and experience marked decrease in sleep efficiency. There may also be some changes in circadian rhythms. Studies are ongoing about what causes these changes and how they may be reduced to ensure comfortable sleep of old adults.|$|E

They found that students who started at 8:40 got higher grades and more sleep on weekday nights than those who started earlier. One in four U.S. high school students admits <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> in class {{at least once a}} week.|$|R
25|$|One night, Pu Tong Seal {{was very}} tired from his all-day journey on foot, and began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in the jungle. The moment he dozed off, a tiger {{attacked}} him. He {{seemed to have}} a sixth sense, even when resting. The warlord never took chances, day or night, but was always alert for the unexpected ambush whether by human or animal. He bent the tiger's body so hard that the spinal cord broke, and the tiger died on the spot.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{signature}} symptoms of mania (and to a lesser extent, hypomania) is what many have described as racing thoughts. These are usually instances in which the manic person is excessively distracted by objectively unimportant stimuli. This experience creates an absent-mindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy him or her, making him or her unable {{to keep track of}} time, or be aware of anything besides the flow of thoughts. Racing thoughts also interfere with the ability <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{remained}} at Bologna {{in the care}} of a pork butcher while his father played the horn in the orchestras of the theatres at which his wife sang. The boy had three years of instruction in the playing of the harpsichord from Giuseppe Prinetti, originally from Novara, who played the scale with two fingers only; Prinetti also owned a business selling beer and had a propensity <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> while standing. These qualities made him a subject for ridicule {{in the eyes of the}} young Rossini.|$|E

50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{explanation for}} the existence of the hypnic jerk is unclear, but a possibility {{is that it is a}} vestigial reflex humans evolved when they usually slept in trees. Experiencing a hypnic jerk prior <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> may have been selected so that the individual would be able to readjust their sleeping position in the tree with a branch-grabbing response <b>to</b> avoid <b>falling,</b> much as orangutans grasp upper branches of trees while sleeping.|$|R
5000|$|Hoot the Owl is the {{associate}} {{and best friend}} of Jimmy Giggle. Although owls are traditionally nocturnal, the show depicts him favouring the daytime, which he finds [...] "very exciting". However, it is also stated that due to him being awake at daytime, he is often undoubtedly prone <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Hoot lives in a chest of drawers that he has fashioned as his own personal apartment. Hoot also plays the harmonica and triangle.|$|R
