A series of sequential impacts tests using simulant-fueled LWRHU capsules was recently conducted to determine a failure threshold.

Nine months later, Intel introduced its successor, codenamed Presler, but without offering significant upgrades in design, still resulting in relatively high power consumption.

40|$|Concentrated {{solar thermal}} energy can be {{utilized}} {{in a variety of}} high temperature applications for both terrestrial and space environments. In each application, knowledge of the collector and absorber's heat exchange interaction is required. To understand this coupled mechanism, various concentrator types and geometries, as well as, their relationship to the physical absorber mechanics were investigated. To conduct experimental tests various parts of a 5, 000 <b>watt,</b> <b>thermal</b> concentrator, facility were made and evaluated. This was in anticipation at a larger NASA facility proposed for construction. Although much of the work centered on solar thermal propulsion for an upper stage (less than one pound thrust range), the information generated and the facility's capabilities are applicable to material processing, power generation and similar uses. The numerical calculations used to design the laboratory mirror and the procedure for evaluating other solar collectors are presented here. The mirror design is based on a hexagonal faceted system, which uses a spherical approximation to the parabolic surface. The work began with a few two dimensional estimates and continued with a full, three dimensional, numerical algorithm written in FORTRAN code. This was compared to a full geometry, ray trace program, BEAM 4, which optimizes the curvatures, based on purely optical considerations. Founded on numerical results, the characteristics of a faceted concentrator were construed. The numerical methodologies themselves were evaluated and categorized. As a result, the three-dimensional FORTRAN code was the method chosen to construct the mirrors, due to its overall accuracy and superior results to the ray trace program. This information is being used to fabricate and subsequently, laser map the actual mirror surfaces. Evaluation of concentrator mirrors, thermal applications and scaling the results of the 10 foot diameter mirror to a much larger concentrator, were studied. Evaluations, recommendations and pit falls regarding the structure, materials and facility design are presented...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} steps in the search for life on Mars is to determine if a specific sub-surface location it is "habitable", or that it provides the conditions and requirements to support life as we know it. In this thesis, I present a miniature, thermal-IR radiometer and reflectometer designed to determine temperature, the presence of water ice, and the discrimination of minerals, all necessary for a habitable environment. A dual use detector was selected for the thermal and five reflectance channels. The IR source is provided by five LEDs. These components were embedded in a thermally controlled aluminium block. Integrated electronics provided signal amplification and demodulation. This device will be suitable for drilling applications with less than 25 mm diameter boreholes and with limited available power (< 5 <b>watts).</b> <b>Thermal</b> testing was within a simulated borehole mounted in a thermal vacuum chamber. The results were compared to a theoretical model of the expected temperature. The maximum temperature error between predicted and measured was 0. 21 K (∼ 0. 08 %). The total RMS error of all sources were calculated to be < 3 %. Reflectance testing in all five channels included a variety of minerals and a two point calibration method. The results were compared to the predicted reflectance values for the samples. The results of the reflectance channel testing demonstrated that the measured values matched the predicted values with a 2. 5 % measured error. The total RMS error was 6. 1 %. Detection and discrimination of water ice and hydrated minerals included a non-linear mixing model and/or testing. The model predicted that water ice mixed in a pyroxene mineral matrix can be detected and discriminated from 5 % to 60 % concentration by weight. Testing with a hydrated mineral mixed within a non-hydrated mineral matrix demonstrated that the measured result matched the predicted result from 5 - 45 % concentration by weight. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{summarize}} {{a study of the}} propagation of a quench in a HOM damper probe of the 56 MHz superconducting storage cavity for RHIC and provide guidance for machine protection. The 56 MHz cavity [1] is designed to operate as a beam-driven superconducting quarter-wave resonator in the RHIC ring. Four Higher Order Mode (HOM) dampers [2] are used to prevent beam instabilities [3] in RHIC. These are inserted in the back wall of the cavity (the high magnetic field region) through ports that also serve for rinsing the cavity with high-pressure deionized water as well as the fundamental power coupler and pick-up ports. Figure 1 shows the outline of the cavity [4, 5]. The HOM damper probe has a magnetic coupling loop which penetrates the cavity as shown in Figure 2 [5]. The loop is cooled by conduction to the 4. 3 K helium system, thus any sudden, significant amount of heat dumped on the loop will cause local heating. The peak magnetic field on the loop can reach about 7. 4 x 10 {sup 4 } amperes per meter at a cavity voltage of 2. 5 MV [5]. The scenario we present here is that a small region on the loop quenches. We can calculate the current driving the cavity using the RHIC parameters and get the magnetic field {{as a function of the}} current, the cavity's intrinsic Q and detuning parameter, however it turns out that within the time relevant for the quench development (a fraction of a second) the cavity field does not change sufficiently to warrant this extra computation. Thus we can assume that the field over the loop is constant. The damper loop dimensions are not so important, however its cross section is. In the following we assume that the loop's cross-section is 2 cm by 0. 3 cm. It is actually rounded in cross section (sharp corners avoided) but we will approximate it as square. The material parameters taken for the niobium loop (assuming high RRR of about 200) are given in the following stepwise linear approximations. The surface resistivity in ohms as a function of temperature in degrees Kelvin is given in Figure 3, the <b>thermal</b> conductivity in <b>watt</b> per degree meter as a function of temperature is given in Figure 4 and the heat capacity in Joule per kg as a function of temperature is given in Figure 5...|$|R
