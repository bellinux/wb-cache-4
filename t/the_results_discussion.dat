The main objective of the study was, therefore, to analyse factors that influence MSEs decision to innovate with a specific focus on the production level worker skills level and managerial experience.

The main goal is to cancel, in a prescribed near field region, the longitudinal component of the electric field of an incoming TM wave while having vanishingly small fields near the waveguide boundary. The main analytical challenge is to design appropriate source functions for the scalar Helmholtz equation so that the desired cancellation effect will be obtained.

Methods/design. This study is mixed methods in design. A randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of blended learning versus didactic approach of teaching EBP to medical students. The primary outcome of the RCT is EBP competency as assessed by the Berlin tool.

40|$|This {{research}} project examined {{the extent to}} which an individual’s attachment style, measured via the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire (Fraley, Waller, 2 ̆ 6 Brennan, 2000), is related to early, formative experiences of religious involvement, as well as particular religious orientations. This study drew 132 mostly Caucasian participants, who were diverse in terms of age, gender, and education. Data were collected via online survey, which gathered responses to a demographic form, the Religious Practices Questionnaire, and the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire. Researchers hypothesized that participants whose religious orientation and involvement mirrors that of their primary caretakers during the participant’s upbringing (“same” group) will display significantly less attachment-related avoidance and anxiety than those with differing religious views (“different” group). Results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} between the “same” and “different” groups in terms of attachment-related avoidance or anxiety. Also, religious and non-religious groups were not different in this regard, either.
