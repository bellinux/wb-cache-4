5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective {{and on a}} journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E

5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first {{connected}} to a USB host, <b>the</b> USB <b>device</b> enumeration process <b>is</b> started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to <b>the</b> USB <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> data rate of <b>the</b> USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> determined during <b>the</b> reset signaling. After reset, <b>the</b> USB <b>device's</b> information <b>is</b> read by the host and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by <b>the</b> host, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> drivers needed for communicating with <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>are</b> loaded and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state.

5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> in fact powering the machine.|$|E

5|$|Over time, as Rome's empire grew, the two annual consuls {{ceased to}} be enough to command its many armies in the field or {{administer}} its many provinces. To solve this problem, it became normal to prorogue the authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in the field. Over time, however, with increasing need for competent generals and administrators, prorogation of magistrates became the norm; and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> used, increasingly by the assemblies, to grant imperium to popular politicians.|$|E

5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>was</b> crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E

30|$|For example, {{consider}} a given <b>device</b> life-cycle. In <b>the</b> pre-deployment, some cryptographic material <b>is</b> loaded into <b>the</b> <b>device</b> during its manufacturing process. Next, {{the owner of}} <b>the</b> <b>device</b> purchases it and gets a PIN that grants the owner the initial access to <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> later installed and commissioned within a network by an installer during the bootstrapping phase. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> identity and <b>the</b> secret keys used during normal operation <b>are</b> provided to <b>the</b> <b>device</b> during this phase. After being bootstrapped, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> in operational mode. During this operational phase, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> will need to prove its identity (D 2 D communication) and to control the access to its resources/data. For devices with lifetimes spanning several years, maintenance cycles should be required. During each maintenance phase, the software on <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can <b>be</b> upgraded, or applications (running on <b>the</b> <b>device)</b> can <b>be</b> reconfigured. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> continues to loop through the operational phase until <b>the</b> <b>device</b> <b>is</b> decommissioned at <b>the</b> end of its lifecycle. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can also <b>be</b> removed and re-commissioned {{to be used in}} a different system under a different owner thereby starting the lifecycle all over again.
