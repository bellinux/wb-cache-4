25|$|In the 1960s the Hilltopper {{was chosen}} as the mascot in a vote by the student body. (Previously, the school teams were iconified by a <b>top-hat</b> and gloves). In 1980 a mural of the Hilltopper was painted in Griffith Gymnasium. In this mural the Hilltopper was {{prominently}} depicted as a rugged Mountain Man with a walking stick atop the scenic Jemez Mountains that overlook LAHS. In 2004, the mural was destroyed during renovations to the Gymnasium's HVAC system when a series of fans were installed on the gym's interior south wall.|$|E

As she sings, stage hands and other performers, {{such as a}} man with a dog and a man dressed as a pole, greet her as they leave the stage. At the end of the video, Ochi and her band-mates run off the stage to reveal the field the video was shot in, and dance with all of the other performers.|$|E

500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled <b>top-hat.</b> He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1956, Charles Woodward Pappe, an {{entrepreneur}} from Kingfisher, Oklahoma, met Troy Smith (businessman) while visiting friends in Shawnee, Oklahoma.

2500|$|Some lwa have {{particular}} {{links with}} magic, ancestor worship or death {{such as the}} Ghedes and Barons. A number of these are further particularly associated with transgenderism or same-sex interactions. These include Ghede Nibo, a spirit caring for those who die young. He is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds, especially transgender or lesbian behaviour in women. Ghede Nibo's parents are Baron Samedi and Maman Brigitte; Baron Samedi {{is the leader of}} the Ghedes and Barons and is depicted as bisexual dandy or occasionally transgender, wearing a <b>top-hat</b> and frock coat along with a women's skirts and shoes. Samedi has a tendency toward [...] "lascivious movements" [...] that cross gender boundaries and also imply a lust for anal sex.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Top Hat name was already trademarked, Smith and Pappe {{changed the name}} to Sonic in 1959. The new name worked with their existing slogan, [...] "Service with the Speed of Sound". After the name change, the first Sonic sign was installed at the Stillwater <b>Top-Hat</b> Drive-In; {{this was the first}} of three Sonics that would eventually exist in Stillwater. The original Sonic to carry the first sign was demolished and renovated in May 2015. Although Smith and Pappe were being asked to help open new franchise locations, [...] no real royalty plan was in place. The pair decided to have their paper company charge an extra penny for each Sonic-label hamburger bag it sold. The proceeds would then be split between Smith and Pappe. The first franchise contracts under this plan were drawn up, but still no joint marketing plan, standardized menu, or detailed operating requirements were in place.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, {{navigation}} was only possible to {{the east side of the}} bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an overhead cable from the west shore. [...] With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. [...] Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). [...] A pole was erected on each [...] fender, and a guy wire run between them directly over the bridge. [...] The power cable was suspended from this guy wire to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. [...] This <b>top-hat,</b> and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. [...] This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.|$|E

60|$|He was a slim, smooth person, passing {{very quickly}} among the quickly passing crowd, but {{though there was}} nothing about him {{sufficient}} to attract a startled notice, there was quite enough to demand a curious consideration when once that notice was attracted. He wore a black <b>top-hat,</b> but there was enough in it of those strange curves whereby the decadent artist of the eighties tried to turn the <b>top-hat</b> into something as rhythmic as an Etruscan vase. His hair, which was largely grey, was curled with the instinct of one who appreciated the gradual beauty of grey and silver. The rest of his face was oval and, I thought, rather Oriental; he had two black tufts of moustache.|$|E
