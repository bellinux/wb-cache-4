5|$|They {{climb the}} tower and come to another door; inside lies a second world {{surrounded}} by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air. They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They encounter the second fiend, Sei-ryu; they defeat him and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} 2011 Orange Bowl after an 11-2 regular season that culminated with a 44-33 win in the 2010 ACC Championship Game, clinching the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and an automatic BCS bid. Stanford was picked as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matchup following an 11-1 campaign that included the school's best-ever regular-season record. That performance earned the Cardinal a No. 4 ranking in the BCS Poll and the automatic bid to a BCS game that accompanies that status. In the weeks before the game, media attention focused on both teams' turnarounds from historical difficulties and the performance of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} Orange Bowl after a 9–4 season that culminated in a 30–12 victory in the 2008 ACC Championship Game.

In the weeks between the teams' selection and the playing of the game, media attention focused on the nature of Cincinnati's first BCS game appearance and Virginia Tech's attempt to win its first BCS game since 1995. Attention also focused on Cincinnati's proficient offense and Virginia Tech's highly rated defense.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to participate in the}} Orange Bowl after an 11–2 regular season that culminated with a 44–33 win in the 2010 ACC Championship Game. Stanford was picked as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matchup following an 11–1 campaign that included the school's best-ever regular-season record. That performance earned the Cardinal a No. 4 ranking in the BCS Poll and the automatic bid to a BCS game that accompanies a top-4 ranking of a second school in a conference other than the champion. In the weeks before that game, media attention focused on both teams' turnarounds from historical difficulties and the performance of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. The game also was the first Orange Bowl not sponsored by FedEx in 21 years, ending the longest-running title sponsorship deal among the major bowls.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} line was particularly concerned with containing Florida State sophomore defensive end Brandon Jenkins, who was {{tied for third}} {{in the nation in}} sacks (12) and 15th in tackles for loss (18.5). On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defensive line, defensive end Markus White recorded seven sacks during the regular season. In total, Florida State's defense was No.1 in college football in terms of sacks (43) and 15th in tackles for loss (7.2 per game). Florida State placed a priority on containing Tyrod Taylor and preventing him from scrambling for extra yardage. The Seminoles were 39th nationally in total defense, allowing an average of 341 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duumvirate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the Peach Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the Peach Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by the Peach Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the Peach Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, {{with the field}} being split into two groups. In {{the first group of}} twelve runners, Wilson topped the session, 0.46 seconds ahead of the HVM Racing machine of Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro—one of four female drivers in the race—with Alex Tagliani in third position. Other drivers to make it into the second session of qualifying were Power, Takuma Sato and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Hunter-Reay topping his second session of the day. Hélio Castroneves, Briscoe, Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power recorded the fastest lap time, holding off the British pair Wilson and Franchitti. Hunter-Reay, Kanaan and Tagliani finished between fourth and sixth, and would be <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Franchitti saved his best lap of qualifying to the last possible moment, taking his thirteenth career IndyCar Series pole position, and his 24th in American open-wheel racing. Tagliani took second on the grid, on his début with the FAZZT Race Team. Wilson took third ahead of Hunter-Reay, Power and Kanaan.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line {{is served}} by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro.

All {{services}} operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On {{the east side of the}} city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{character}} {{designs were}} drawn by Etsushi Sajima and {{were based on}} the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi. The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before he could see the animated versions of his designs. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series' creatures i.e. the various devils (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop designs were done by Hatsue Nakayama and color designs were done by Keiichi Funada.

Nakagawa was initially surprised to have been offered to be the musical composer but took up the role as a challenge. In addition to Nagakawa, Sound Direction was done by Satoki Iida along with Sound Effects by Iki Okuda.
