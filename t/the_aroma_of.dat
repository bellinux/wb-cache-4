5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. <b>The</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. In defining the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E

40|$|Coffee aroma, {{with more}} than 600 components, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most complex food aromas. Although electronic noses have been successfully used for objective analysis and differentiation <b>of</b> total coffee <b>aromas,</b> it is difficult to use them to describe the specific features <b>of</b> coffee <b>aroma</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> type of smell). This is because data obtained by electronic noses are generally based on electrical resistance/current and samples are distinguished by principal component analysis. In this paper, we present an electronic nose that is capable of learning <b>the</b> wine related <b>aromas</b> using <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> kit “Le Nez du Vin,” and the potential to describe coffee aroma in a similar manner comparable to how wine experts describe wine <b>aroma.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> our investigation showed that <b>the</b> <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> three drip coffees were more similar to those of pine and honey in <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> kit than to <b>the</b> <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> three canned coffees.

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were particularly interested in <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender and thyme, presumably {{as a reflection of}} the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E
25|$|Surrealist Street filled {{one side}} of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists.

The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery. In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp´s coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real water lilies and reeds, which he called Avant La Mare. Illumination was provided only by a single light bulb, so patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> roasting coffee filled the air.

25|$|Pepper {{gets its}} spicy heat mostly from piperine derived {{both from the}} outer fruit and the seed. Black pepper {{contains}} between 4.6% and 9.7% piperine by mass, and white pepper slightly more than that. Refined piperine, by weight, is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers. The outer fruit layer, left on black pepper, also contains aroma-contributing terpenes, including germacrene (11%), limonene (10%), pinene (10%), alpha-phellandrene (9%), and beta-caryophyllene (7%), which give citrusy, woody, and floral notes. These scents are mostly missing in white pepper, which is stripped of the fruit layer. White pepper can gain different odours (including musty notes) from its longer fermentation stage. <b>The</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> pepper is attributed to rotundone (3,4,5,6,7,8-Hexahydro-3α,8α-dimethyl-5α-(1-methylethenyl)azulene-1(2H)-one), a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of cyperus rotundus, which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanograms/L in water and in wine: rotundone is also present in marjoram, oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, and geranium, {{as well as in}} some Shiraz wines.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Hops {{contribute}} many desirable aromas to beer. Traditionally hop aromas {{have been}} described by the point of addition in the brewing process (dry-hop, finish-hop, or kettle-hop). The compounds present in the oil provide a wide range <b>of</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities. Since <b>the</b> composition of the oil is different for each hop variety {{it is reasonable to}} assume that <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> each variety would be different. Moreover, since a different composition of compounds would be added to the beer at each addition point, it would be expected that different hop varieties would produce beers with different aroma qualities. Trained panel free-choice profiling was used to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> selected raw hops and of dry-hopped lagers and finish-hopped lagers produced with the same hops. The first study compared <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> eight commercial and seven experimental varieties of raw hops. The raw hops had intense aromas and were separated into five different groups based on their aroma qualities. Three experimental varieties were found to have similar aroma qualities to varieties with German parentage. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of the hop oil compounds and <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities that separated the varieties. The second and third studies compared <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> American Lagers dry-hopped (second) and finish-hopped (third) with twelve of the fifteen hop varieties from the first study. In both studies the lagers were separated into three groups based on their aroma qualities. There was no relationship that could be applied to all varieties between <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dry-hopped lagers and the finish-hopped lagers. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hop varieties from all three studies, <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> qualities <b>of</b> many of the raw hops were similar when used for dry-hopping, but changed when used for finish-hopping.

25|$|Among the {{winemaking}} decisions where a producer's style {{can come}} through is {{the decision of}} whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to percolate through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and aroma of the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will be up to the winemaker with some tannins adding to the mouthfeel and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to <b>the</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine.|$|E
