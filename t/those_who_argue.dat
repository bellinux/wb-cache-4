In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests.

5|$|Scholars debate {{when the}} third Lombard–Gepid War started; {{it is agreed}} that it took place {{two years after the}} second war. The {{possible}} dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such as Walter Pohl protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.|$|E
5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E

5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> that the sea mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it}} as Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E

Easter was henceforward to be a Sunday in a lunar month chosen according to Christian criteria—in effect, a Christian Nisan—not in the month of Nisan as defined by Jews. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> for continued reliance on the Jewish calendar (called [...] "protopaschites" [...] by later historians) were urged to come around to the majority position.

25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> that the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> {{the same for the}} latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E

Contemporary art is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in modern art or as another form of late modernism.|$|E

Gosta W.

There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor {{on the one hand}} and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.|$|E

During the composition of Finnegans Wake, Joyce used signs, or so-called [...] "sigla”, rather than names to designate these character amalgams or types. In a letter to his Maecenas, Harriet Shaw Weaver (March 1924), Joyce made a list of these sigla. For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> for the existence of distinguishable characters, the book focuses on the Earwicker family, which consists of father, mother, twin sons and a daughter.|$|E

500|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> that Tyrannosaurus was {{incapable}} of running estimate the top speed of Tyrannosaurus at about [...] This is still faster than its most likely prey species, hadrosaurids and ceratopsians. In addition, some advocates {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was a predator claim that tyrannosaur running speed is not important, since it may have been slow but still faster than its probable prey. Thomas Holtz also noted that Tyrannosaurus had proportionately longer feet than the animals it hunted: duck-billed dinosaurs and horned dinosaurs. Paul and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos. Healed Tyrannosaurus bite wounds on ceratopsian fossils are interpreted as evidence of attacks on living ceratopsians (see below). If the ceratopsians that lived alongside Tyrannosaurus were fast, that casts doubt on the argument that Tyrannosaurus {{did not have to be}} fast to catch its prey.|$|E
500|$|The girdle's {{symbolic}} meaning, in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, {{has been}} construed {{in a variety}} of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> for the sexual inference view the girdle as a [...] "trophy". However, it is not entirely clear who the [...] "winner" [...] is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In Sir Gawain, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one. [...] While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).|$|E

Cesarani wrote that Dawidowicz was wrong to accuse Trevor-Roper of antisemitism but argued that there was an element of truth to her critique in that the Shoah was a blind-spot for Trevor-Roper.|$|R
