5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of the lower courts.|$|E

5|$|Only {{four days}} after {{returning}} from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on the subject. At Teheran, Ismay helped <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship, scrapping his other plans for the trip.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E

McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a clear separation between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over the proper roles of civilian and military leaders.|$|E

She continued to tour the subcontinent, claiming that she then spent time in Sikkim and Tibet, where she visited her teacher's ashram for several days.

Bratton of Little Rock. Jones continued to support the cases, and in 1923 the Supreme Court ruled in Moore v. Dempsey that, for the first time, collateral attack through habeas corpus was permissible on a state appellate court decision. It was a landmark precedent that marked the Court's review of state criminal cases {{from the point of}} view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. During the trials, Jones received frequent lynching threats while in Arkansas. He was said to have shifted his location each night because of the risk to his safety.|$|E
25|$|Tying the Series at a game a piece, Eagle's ace Masahiro Tanaka {{earned a}} victory in Game 2 by {{striking}} out 12 in his complete game performance. The game's first run came with Ginji Akaminai's RBI single for the Eagles in the sixth inning. In {{the bottom of the}} next inning, with runners on first and third, Kazuya Fujita hit a ground ball to second base. Giants' second baseman Takayuki Terauchi fielded the ball and threw it to first base in an attempt to throw out a head-first-sliding Fujita. First base umpire Kenjiro Mori called Fujita safe, however replays showed that he should have been out as the ball reached the base first. Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara came onto the field <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> call with Mori but the call stood. Mori's blown call was exaggerated when Terauchi hit {{what should have been a}} game-tying solo home run the next inning.|$|E
25|$|Anselm held {{a council}} at Lambeth Palace {{which found that}} Henry's beloved Matilda had not {{technically}} become a nun and was thus eligible to wed and become queen. On Michaelmas in 1102, Anselm {{was finally able to}} convene a general church council at London, establishing the Gregorian Reform within England. The council prohibited marriage, concubinage, and drunkenness to all those in holy orders, condemned sodomy and simony, and regulated clerical dress. Anselm also obtained a resolution against the British slave trade. Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed—in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them—that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown. In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy William Warelwast. Anselm supposedly travelled in order <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>the</b> king's case for a dispensation but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.|$|E

500|$|Danforth's {{politics}} and religion were relatively conservative, with one historian describing him as [...] "the Pym of Massachusetts politics". [...] In 1661 the colony was rebuked by King Charles II for its mistreatment of Quakers; the colonial government had banned Quakers from its territory {{under threat of}} death, and four of them had recently been hanged after repeatedly violating the ban. [...] The king in his letter demanded that the colony allow Quakers and others freedom of religious expression. [...] Danforth was one member of a committee that was established to formulate a response. [...] The document the committee drafted was a conservative declaration that the colonial government was essentially sovereign except where its laws conflicted with English law. [...] (By the time the king's letter arrived the colonial government had already lessened the harsh punishments for violating bans.)
