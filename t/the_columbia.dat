5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> with the Missouri. When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before heading down <b>the</b> <b>Columbia,</b> concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E

5|$|In 1806, {{explorer}} David Thompson set {{out from}} Saskatchewan to find the source of <b>the</b> <b>Columbia.</b> He crossed over the Canadian Rockies through Howse Pass and eventually arrived {{on the banks of}} the Kootenay, which he thought to be <b>the</b> <b>Columbia.</b> Thompson traveled down the river a ways but turned back when he was attacked by Native Americans. The following year, Thompson, his family, and several men made another attempt at finding <b>the</b> <b>Columbia.</b> They crossed over the Rockies at a more northerly spot and traveled down the Blaeberry River to <b>the</b> <b>Columbia,</b> eventually discovering Columbia Lake and establishing there the trading post Kootenae House. In the spring of 1808, he set off down the Kootenay River, this time reaching present-day Montana and Idaho where he established Kullyspell House and Saleesh House, trading posts on Lake Pend Oreille and the Clark Fork, respectively. After spending a winter in Montana, he tried to reach <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> by traveling down the Pend Oreille River but failed in this attempt, eventually returning to Kootenae House via the Kootenay River northwards the following spring.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Basin, {{almost half of}} {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Columbia</b> Gorge AVA {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Gorge. This region {{straddles}} <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River, and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington; it {{is made up of}} Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety of grapes, including Syrah, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.|$|E
5|$|The Pend Oreille River system (including {{its main}} tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar {{in size to}} <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> at their confluence.

5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river.

Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River system.|$|E
