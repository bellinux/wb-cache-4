However, some cameras lack this grid at all and some other have grid with only four axes leaving focus point without reference lines. (Figure 1) Fig. 1 : The commonest four axes grid leaves focus point without reference lines.

On the other hand, the light-yellowish thread-like adult pinworms are clearly visually detectable, usually during the night when they move near the anus, or on toilet paper. <b>Transparent</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape (e.g. Scotch Tape) applied on the anal area will pick up deposited eggs, and diagnosis can be made by examining the tape with a microscope. This test is most successful if done every morning for several days, because the females do not lay eggs every day, and the number of eggs vary.|$|R

30|$|Adhesion {{test was}} {{performed}} on the films as per ASTM-B 905 standard after bending.

No significant change in the surface morphology of the deposited film was observed after the peel off test which suggests that the bonding was fairly strong.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} employed {{method is to}} use tape or a general purpose <b>adhesive</b> <b>dressing.</b> Unfortunately the <b>adhesive</b> used on the tape or dressing will generally be inappropriate for this use. The adhesive strength may change when reaching body temperature, or over time.As the operation progresses this can cause the adhesive to stop working and become gooey, allowing the eyelids to move apart, and leaving behind a sticky residue. This leaves the cornea exposed to epithelial drying and/or abrasions, sometimes caused by the tape that was originally applied to protect the cornea. Alternatively, the adhesive strength may increase, which upon removal can result in eyelid bruising, tears, or eyelash removal.|$|R

The semiconductor particle size could be controlled via the Cd 2 + concentration and the amine groups of chitosan were identified to be of importance for the coordination of the semiconductor.

30|$|Next, the as-grown fibres on the mica disc {{are covered}} by a <b>transparent</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape, which not only does not {{significantly}} affect the blue emission of the fibres, but {{also serves as a}} protective cover. By peeling off the tape from the substrate, the mica disc supporting the fibres is cleaved to an ultrathin and transparent layer. Hence, the fibres on the ultrathin mica disc are surrounded by an adhesive area and can be directly mounted on the product to be marked. By shaping the shadow mask in a unidirectional manner, a fiducial point {{on the surface of the}} tag can always be identified in a low magnification microscopic image of the surface; the unique nanofibre pattern can thus be detected and extracted by an image processing software.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of dual-junction solar cells with a Si bottom cell {{has been investigated}} both theoretically and experimentally. Simulations show that adding a top junction with an energy bandgap of 1. 6 - 1. 9 eV to a standard silicon solar cell enables efficiencies over 38 %. Currently, top junctions of GaInP (1. 8 eV) are the most promising as they can achieve 1 -sun efficiencies of 20. 8 % [1]. We fabricated mechanically stacked, four terminal GaInP/Si tandem solar cells using a <b>transparent</b> <b>adhesive</b> between the subcells. These tandem devices achieved an efficiency of 27 % under AM 1. 5 g spectral conditions. Higher efficiencies {{can be achieved by}} using an improved Si-bottom cell and by optimizing the dual-junction device for long-wavelength light and luminescent coupling between the two junctions...|$|R
