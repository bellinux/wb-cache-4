Sera from Swiss mice and Calomys callosus animals infected with <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> cruzi strains inhibit both reactions. Inhibition increases during the infection, reaching maximal levels when the parasitemia decreases. Among 44 sera of untreated chronic Chagasic patients, 40 inhibit both reactions. Inhibition is observed with total, defatted sera or with purified immunoglobulins. Whereas most of the inhibitory antibodies from Chagasic patients react with the papain fragment of trans-sialidase in immunoblots, a few patients have noninhibitory antibodies that react only with the entire trans-sialidase.

40|$|Polyoma virus-specific RNA {{isolated}} from the cytoplasm of lytically infected cells can be translated in vitro to yield three T antigens, of Mrs approximately 90, 000, 60, 000, and 22, 000. The tryptic peptide patterns of the T antigens synthesized in vitro are similar or identical to the patterns of the corresponding proteins in polyoma-infected cells. All three proteins incorporate methionine donated from initiator tRNA in vitro. Polyoma cRNA codes for a protein that is slightly larger than the 22, 000 T antigen and that, by other criteria, {{is similar to the}} 22, 000 T antigen. Translation of cRNA does not yield the 90, 000 and 60, 000 T antigens, suggesting that the generation of the mRNAs for these T antigens requires the removal of intervening sequences. The mRNA for the 90, 000 T antigen is smaller than the mRNAs for the 22, 000 and 60, 000 proteins. All three proteins share common NH 2 -terminal sequences, and the 60, 000 T antigen may be translated partially in a different reading frame from sequences also coding for the 90, 000 T antigen.

40|$|In {{standard}} pairwise crosses {{there was}} no detectable recombination between defective reovirus lacking the largest genomic segment and prototypes of the seven known classes of ts mutants. However, in such crosses between R 2 A (201) and the various prototypes frequencies of ts+ recombinants between 2. 6 and 6. 1 % were observed, as others have found (Fields, 1971; Fields and Joklik, 1969). An infectious center assay was devised to measure recombination in this system, and {{it was found that}} all mixedly infected cells gave rise to ts+ recombinants in crosses between prototype ts mutants, but no recombination was detectable when the defective virus was crossed with <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>ts</b> mutants. The ts mutation of mutant R 2 A (201) was efficiently rescued when crossed with UV-inactivated wild-type virus but not when crossed with UV-inactivated defective virus.

The kinetics of recombination were measured in cells mixedly infected with R 2 A (201) and R 2 B (352) mutants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) {{has been}} identified in several different bacteria, including the plant pathogenPantoea ananatis. Previous in silico analyses described <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 6 SS loci present in the pathogenic strain of P. ananatis LMG 20103. This initial investigation has been extended to include an additional seven sequenced strains of P. ananatis together with 39 strains from different ecological niches. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses were used to investigate the distribution, evolution, intra-strain variability and operon structure of the T 6 SS in the sequenced strains. RESULTS: <b>Three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 6 SS loci were identified in P. ananatis strain LMG 20103 and designated PA T 6 SS 1 - 3. PA T 6 SS- 1 was present in all sequenced strains of P. ananatis and in all 39 additional strains examined in this study. In addition, PA T 6 SS- 1 included all 13 core T 6 SS genes required for synthesis of a functional T 6 SS. The plasmid-borne PA T 6 SS- 2 also included all 13 core T 6 SS genes but was restricted to only 33 % (15 / 46) of the strains examined. In addition, PA T 6 SS- 2 was restricted to strains of P. ananatis isolated from symptomatic plant material. This finding raises {{the possibility of an}} association between PA T 6 SS- 2 and either pathogenicity or host specificity. The third cluster PA T 6 SS- 3 was present in all strains analyzed in this study but lacked 11 of the 13 core T 6 SS genes suggesting it may not encoded a functional T 6 SS. Inter-strain variability was also associated with hcp and vgrG islands, which are associated with the T 6 SS and encode a variable number of proteins usually of unknown function. These proteins {{may play a role in}} the fitness of different strains in a variety of ecological niches or as candidate T 6 SS effectors. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PA T 6 SS- 1 and PA T 6 SS- 2 are evolutionarily distinct. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that the three T 6 SSs of P. ananatis appear to have been independently acquired and may play different roles relating to pathogenicity, host range determination and/or niche adaptation. Future work will be directed toward understanding the roles that these T 6 SSs play in the biology of P. ananatis.

40|$|Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} and {{has been}} recognized as an {{opportunistic pathogen in humans}} as well as marine animals. However, the virulence mechanisms for this species of Vibrio have not been elucidated. This study characterized multiple mechanisms that induce cell death in fish cells upon infection with a V. alginolyticus strain, ZJO. The bacterium required its type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to cause rapid death of infected fish cells. Dying cells exhibited some features of apoptotic cells, such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Further studies showed that caspase- 3 was activated by the T 3 SS of the ZJO strain, confirming that infection with V. alginolyticus rapidly induces T 3 SS-dependent apoptosis in fish cells. Infection with the ZJO strain also led to membrane pore formation and release of cellular contents from infected fish cells, as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase release and the uptake of a membrane-impermeable dye. Importantly, inhibition of apoptosis did not prevent ZJO-infected cells from releasing cellular contents and did not block cell rounding. Taken together, these data demonstrate that infection with V. alginolyticus may promote at least <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 3 SS-dependent events, which lead to the death of fish cells. This study provides an important insight into the mechanism used by Vibrio species to cause host-cell death...|$|E

Lapachol (naphthoquinone) and &# 946;-lapachone (quinone) are the two main chemical constituents of T. impetiginosa. These compounds have several biological properties. They induce apoptosis by generating oxygen-reactive species, thereby inhibiting topoisomerases (I and II) or inducing other enzymes dependent on NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, thus affecting cell cycle checkpoints. The SMART {{was used in the}} standard (ST) version, which has normal levels of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes, to check the direct action of this compound, and in the high bioactivation (HB) version, which has a high constitutive level of CYP enzymes, to check for indirect action in <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> impetiginosa concentrations (10 %, 20 % or 40 % w/w).

Antibodies were highly specific for the V regions of the infecting clone, and cross-reactivity was rare.

Like other organisms the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila presents several MT isoforms, which have been classified into two subfamilies (Cd- and Cu-metallothioneins). The main aim {{of this study was to}} examine the specific functions and transcriptional regulation of the five MT isoforms present in T. thermophila, by using several strains of this ciliate. After a laboratory evolution experiment over more than two years, <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> thermophila strains adapted to extreme metal stress (Cd 2 +, Cu 2 + or Pb 2 +) were obtained.

Our results provide a strong basis for assigning differential roles to the set of MT isoforms. MTT 1 appears to have a key role in adaptation to Cd. In contrast, MTT 2 / 4 are crucial for Cu-adaptation and MTT 5 appears to be important for Pb-adaptation and might be considered as an "alarm" MT gene for responding to metal stress. Moreover, results indicate that likely a coordinated transcriptional regulation exists between the MT genes, particularly among MTT 1, MTT 5 and MTT 2 / 4.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the humoral immune {{response}} to Trypanosoma cruzi have shown that antibodies which are able to bind living parasites and lyse them in conjunction with complement are associated with host protection. Antibodies which support complement-mediated lysis (CML) of trypomastigotes are elicited {{as a result of}} an active infection and not after immunization with killed parasites. In spite of the requirement for immune antibodies, lysis proceeds mainly via the alternative complement pathway. We have purified a 160 -kilodalton (kDa) glycoprotein from T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes which appears to be a specific target for lytic antibodies. Rabbit antiserum to the purified 160 -kDa protein was prepared, and we have determined that these antibodies will support CML of tissue-culture-derived trypomastigotes. The percentage of killing (65 to 70 %) was consistent among <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> cruzi strains tested. In order to examine the specificity of antibody-dependent CML, antibodies to T. cruzi neuraminidase, an unrelated trypomastigote membrane glycoprotein, were tested in the CML, assays and were not found lytic. Viable trypomastigotes bound anti- 160 -kDa antibodies uniformly as demonstrated by immunofluorescence, whereas antineuraminidase antibodies were extensively capped. The 160 -kDa glycoprotein is specifically produced in infectious trypomastigotes (tissue culture derived and metacyclic) and was not detected in epimastigotes or amastigotes. The identification of the 160 -kDa glycoprotein as a specific target for lytic antibodies, as well as its expression only in the infectious stage of the parasite, suggests an important role for this protein in eliciting host immunity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chagas ’ {{disease is}} caused by the hemoflagellate {{protozoan}} Trypanosoma cruzi. The most common, serious manifestation of Chagas ’ disease is a progressive inflammatory cardiomyopathy, which occurs decades after primary infection. The inability to consistently demonstrate T. cruzi by histologic techniques in inflammatory cardiac lesions has suggested that the parasites ’ persistence may not be required for the pathology of the chronic phase. In this report we further analyze the persistence and localization of T. cruzi DNA in the hearts of seven patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, along with four indeterminate patients and seven control patients seronegative for T. cruzi infection. In the seven patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, we extracted DNA from selected inflammatory foci-positive (IFP) and inflammatory foci-negative (IFN) areas of ‘ hematoxylin and eosin–stained car-diac tissue. We then used polymerase chain reaction methodology to amplify <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> cruzi sequences (a minicircle sequence [MCS], a satellite repetitive sequence [RS], and, a low copy number sequence within the gene coding for a flagellar protein [FPS]).

Sequence differences were sufficient to distinguish closely related strains and were used to examine links between strains obtained from corneal scrape specimens, contact lenses, lens cases, lens case solutions, and home water-supply faucets of patients with Acanthamoeba. We also looked for evidence of mixed infections. Identification of Acanthamoeba Rns genotypes was based on sequences of ∼ 113 bp within the genus-specific amplicon ASA. S 1. This permitted genotype identification by using nonaxenic cultures. Of 13 specimens obtained from corneal scrapes, contact lenses, lens cases, or lens case solutions, 12 were Rns genotype T 4 and the remaining one was Rns genotype T 3. The sequences of corneal scrape specimens of two patients also were the same as those obtained from their contact lenses or lens case specimens. A possible triple-strain infection was indicated by <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 4 sequences in cultures from one patient's lenses. Although faucet water used by patients to clean their lenses is a possible source of infections, specimens isolated from the faucets at two Acanthamoeba keratitis patients' homes differed from their corneal scrape or lens specimens. The overall results demonstrate the potential of this Rns region for tracking Acanthamoeba keratitis strains in infections and for distinguishing single-strain and closely related multiple-strain infections even when other microorganisms might be present with the cultured specimens.

Although overt hypothyroidism leads to impaired cardiac function and possibly heart failure, the cardiovascular consequences of borderline low thyroid function are not clear. Establishment of a suitable animal model would be helpful. In this study, we characterized a rat model to study the relationship between cardiovascular function and graded levels of thyroid activity. We used rats with surgical thyroidectomy and subcutaneous implantation of slow release pellets with <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 4 doses for 3 wk. In terminal experiments, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiograms and hemodynamics. Myocardial arteriolar density was also quantified morphometrically. Thyroid hormone levels in serum and heart tissue were determined by RIA assays. Thyroidectomy alone led to cardiac atrophy, severe cardiac dysfunction, and a dramatic loss of arterioles. The low T 4 dose normalized serum T 3 and T 4 levels, but cardiac tissue T 3 and T 4 remained below normal. Low-dose T 4 failed to prevent cardiac atrophy or restore cardiac function and arteriolar density to normal values. All cardiac function parameters and myocardial arteriolar density were normalized with the middle dose of T 4, whereas the high dose produced hyperthyroidism. Our results show that thyroid hormones are important regulators of cardiac function and myocardial arteriolar density. This animal model will be useful in studying the pathophysiological consequences of mild thyroid dysfunction. Results also suggest that cardiac function may provide valuable supplemental information in proper diagnosis of mild thyroid conditions. Copyright © 2008 the American Physiological Society.

Tests were also conducted on Mild Steel for comparison. The goal of these tests was to first ascertain the distortion and residual stresses during and after welding of test pieces of the <b>three</b> <b>different</b> steels. <b>Test</b> specimens were: 5. 5 " wide by 18 " long and 0. 5 " thick. A nominal 20 KJ/inch heat input was used in all experiments. Bead on edge was utilized as representative of a butt weld. An automated GMA process was utilized for welding with 98 % argon and 2 % oxygen as shielding gas. The first phase of this experimental investigation established excellent temperature, strain, distortion profiles, and a baseline residual stress.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the stratifications of temperature, T, and {{equivalence}} ratio, φ{symbol}, on the ignition characteristics of a lean homogeneous biodiesel/air mixture at high pressure and intermediate temperature are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). 2 -D DNSs are performed at a constant volume with the variance of temperature and equivalence ratio (T′ and φ{symbol}′) together with a 2 -D isotropic velocity spectrum superimposed on the initial scalar fields. In addition, <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> s(-) φ{symbol} correlations are investigated: (1) baseline cases with T′ only or φ{symbol}′ only, (2) uncorrelated T s(-) φ{symbol} distribution, and (3) negatively-correlated T s(-) φ{symbol} distribution. It is found that the overall combustion is more advanced and the mean heat release rate is more distributed over time with increasing T′ and/or φ{symbol}′ for the baseline and uncorrelated T s(-) φ{symbol} cases. However, the temporal advancement and distribution of the overall combustion caused by T′ or φ{symbol}′ only are nearly annihilated by the negatively-correlated T s(-) φ{symbol} fields. The chemical explosive mode and Damköhler number analyses verify that for the baseline and uncorrelated T s(-) φ{symbol} cases, the deflagration mode is predominant at the reaction fronts for large T′ and/or φ{symbol}′. On the contrary, the spontaneous ignition mode prevails for cases with small T′ or φ{symbol}′, especially for cases with negative T s(-) φ{symbol} correlations, and hence, simultaneous auto-ignition occurs throughout the entire domain, resulting in an excessive rate of heat release. It is also found that turbulence with large intensity, u′, and a short time scale can effectively smooth out initial thermal and compositional fluctuations such that the overall combustion is induced primarily by spontaneous ignition. Based on the present DNS results, the generalization {{of the effects of}} T′, φ{symbol}′, and u′ on the HCCI combustion is made to clarify each effect. These results suggest that temperature and composition stratifications together with a well-designed T s(-) φ{symbol} correlation can alleviate an excessive rate of pressure rise and control the ignition-timing in homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) combustion. © 2014 The Combustion Institute...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of a fast Gradient Spin Echo Technique (GraSE) for cardiac T 2 -mapping, combining a robust estimation of T 2 relaxation times with short acquisition times. The sequence was compared against two previously introduced T 2 -mapping techniques in a phantom and in vivo. Methods: Phantom experiments were performed at 1. 5 T using a commercially available cylindrical gel phantom. <b>Three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T</b> 2 -mapping techniques were compared: a Multi Echo Spin Echo (MESE; serving as a reference), a T 2 -prepared balanced Steady State Free Precession (T 2 prep) and a Gradient Spin Echo sequence. For the subsequent in vivo study, 12 healthy volunteers were examined on a clinical 1. 5 T scanner. The three T 2 -mapping sequences were performed at three short-axis slices. Global myocardial T 2 relaxation times were calculated and statistical analysis was performed. For assessment of pixel-by-pixel homogeneity, the number of segments showing an inhomogeneous T 2 value distribution, as defined by a pixel SD exceeding 20 % of the corresponding observed T 2 time, was counted. Results: Phantom experiments showed a greater difference of measured T 2 values between T 2 prep and MESE than between GraSE and MESE, especially for species with low T 1 values. Both, GraSE and T 2 prep resulted in an overestimation of T 2 times compared to MESE. In vivo, significant differences between mean T 2 times were observed. In general, T 2 prep resulted in lowest (52. 4 +/- 2. 8 ms) and GraSE in highest T 2 estimates (59. 3 +/- 4. 0 ms). Analysis of pixel-by-pixel homogeneity revealed the least number of segments with inhomogeneous T 2 distribution for GraSE-derived T 2 maps. Conclusions: The GraSE sequence is a fast and robust sequence, combining advantages of both MESE and T 2 prep techniques, which promises to enable improved clinical applicability of T 2 -mapping in the future. Our study revealed significant differences of derived mean T 2 values when applying different sequence designs. Therefore, a systematic comparison of different cardiac T 2 -mapping sequences and the establishment of dedicated reference values should be the goal of future studies...|$|E
40|$|At {{specific}} locations {{within the}} Baltic Sea, thermoclines and haloclines can create rapid {{spatial and temporal}} changes in temperature (T) and salinity (S) exceeding 10 A degrees C and 9 psu with seasonal ranges in temperature exceeding 20 A degrees C. These wide ranges in abiotic factors affect the distribution and abundance of Baltic Sea copepods via species-specific, physiological-based impacts on vital rates. In this laboratory study, we characterized the influence of T and S on aspects of reproductive success and naupliar survival of a southwestern Baltic population of Temora longicornis (Copepoda: Calanoida). First, using ad libitum feeding conditions, we measured egg production (EP, no. of eggs female(- 1) day(- 1)) at 12 different temperatures between 2. 5 and 24 A degrees C, observing the highest mean EP at 16. 9 A degrees C (12 eggs female(- 1) day(- 1)). Next, the effect of S on EP and hatching success (HS, %) was quantified at 12 A degrees C for cohorts that had been acclimated to either 8, 14, 20 or 26 psu and tested at each of five salinities (8, 14, 20, 26 and 32 psu). The mean EP was highest for (and maximum EP similar among) 14, 20 and 26 psu cohorts when tested at their acclimation salinity whereas EP was lower at other salinities. For adults reared at 8 psu, a commonly encountered salinity in Baltic surface waters, EP was relatively low at all test salinities-a pattern indicative of osmotic stress. When incubated at 12 A degrees C and 15 different salinities between 0 and 34 psu, HS increased asymptotically with increasing S and was maximal (82. 6 - 84. 3 %) between 24 and 26 psu. However, HS did depend upon the adult acclimation salinity. Finally, the 48 -h survival of nauplii hatched and reared at 14 psu at one of six different temperatures (10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 A degrees C) was measured after exposure to a novel salinity (either 7 or 20 psu). Upon exposure to 7 psu, 48 -h naupliar mortality increased with increasing temperature, ranging from 26. 7 % at 10 A degrees C to 63. 2 % at 20 A degrees C. In contrast, after exposure to 20 psu, mortality was relatively low at all temperatures (1. 7 % at 10 A degrees C and a parts per thousand currency sign 26. 7 % for all other temperatures). An intra-specific comparison of EP for <b>three</b> <b>different</b> <b>T.</b> longicornis populations revealed markedly different temperature optima and clearly demonstrated {{the negative impact of}} brackish (Baltic) salinities.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a relationship between exercise and plasma cortisol levels in endurance horses. A race in which only experienced animals may run longer distances. Thirty male and female, Arabians and crossbred Arabian horses that compete in endurance races were used. They were divided into three groups of 10 animals each: G 1, ran more than 100 km; G 2, ran less than 100 km; and G 3, disqualified due to metabolic problems. Plasma cortisol was quantified at <b>three</b> <b>different</b> moments: <b>t</b> 0, the day before the competition; t 1, 30 to 60 minutes after the end of the circuit; and t 2, 90 to 120 minutes after the end of the circuit. It was concluded that endurance exercise led to an increase of plasma cortisol levels; animals that run longer distances have lower cortisol increase; disqualified animals, who suffered great physical effort, tend to have high cortisol levels and less experienced animals have higher cortisol levels despite running shorter distances...|$|R

The Tsai-Hill failure criterion, modified to account for cyclic loading, is applied to the fatigue data for estimating the fatigue strength parameters of the material under investigation. Results are compared to the strength parameters obtained under quasi-static loading in a previous part of this work [De Monte M. Moosbrugger E, Quaresimin M. Influence of temperature and thickness on the off-axis behaviour of short glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6. 6 - quasi-static loading. Composites: Part A, 2010; 41 (10) : 1368 - 79]. The experimental results highlight how specimen thickness remarkably affects mechanical properties: the thinner the specimen the higher will be the degree of anisotropy. Also temperature strongly reduces the fatigue strength under cyclic loading. The Tsai-Hill criterion allows for an adequate fitting of experimental data at the investigated temperatures and load ratios...|$|R
