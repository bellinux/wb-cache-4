5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55. Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E
5|$|Delta caused {{considerable}} {{damage in the}} Canary Islands. The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of €312million ($364million 2005 US dollars) damage throughout the archipelago. Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands; twelve of the bodies were never found. The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm; winds threw him from his ladder. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95mph (152km/h), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90mph (147km/h). Some patients at Tenerife's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer {{part of the building}} when paneling from the hospital's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building's windows. Off Santa Cruz's southern quay a <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> broke its ties, collided with another vessel, and sank. Passengers at Tenerife North Airport, who were stranded when their flights canceled, witnessed parts of the new international terminal's roof tear off in the wind. In La Palma a falling palm tree, trunk snapped by the wind, injured the leg of a German tourist. Many palm trees along the Avenida Marítima were also blown down. The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices, although other structural damage was minimal. Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Baedeker Raids were in {{operation}} against British cities {{in retaliation for}} RAF Bomber Commands attacks on Germany. The Luftwaffe was stepping up its campaign although it was fully engaged on the Eastern Front. On 18 April Do 217s raided Portsmouth in retaliation for an attack on Lübeck on 28/29 March. An attack on Rostock resulted in retaliation with raids on Bath, Exeter, Canterbury, Norwich and York. On the night of 26–27 April 1942 the Luftwaffe attacked Bath. MacLachlan took off in {{the evening of the}} 26 April and headed for airfields around Evreux and Dreux. He claimed a I./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2—Bomber Wing 2) Dornier Do 217 destroyed which came down near Evreux severely damaged. A second was damaged but his port cannon jammed preventing its destruction. Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory sent his congratulations and his exploits were printed in The Times newspaper. On 30 April MacLachlan and Kuttelwascher set out again with a 25-minute interval between both. Kuttelwascher claimed a Do 217 and He 111, but MacLachlan settled for the destruction of two locomotives between Le Havre and Rouen. He also damaged a <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> on the Seine and destroyed another locomotive near Yvetot. These successes were achieved in two missions on the same night.|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} minor sideline, {{started in the}} 1890s, was the company's <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> operations. Gradually, <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> operations extended {{over a number of}} ports, but until the middle of the 20th century they remained the poor relation of the more significant coastal shipping operations. With the decline of coastal shipping however, towage assumed more importance. By the 1960s, towage and associated operations represented a very significant part of the company's activities.|$|E
25|$|In December 1868 {{the steam}} ferry and <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> Herald was laid up for five weeks, {{undergoing}} a general overhaul in hull and machinery. A pair of new boilers, manufactured by Messrs. Mather, of Bathurst-street, was supplied and installed into the vessel, replacing the now 13-year-old units originally supplied.|$|E
25|$|U-338 was nicknamed Wildesel ("Wild Donkey") {{after an}} {{incident}} {{on the day}} of its launch, when the U-boat broke free from its moorings and struck a small <b>tug</b> <b>boat,</b> sinking it. After training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla at Danzig, U-338 was transferred to the 7th U-boat Flotilla for front-line service on 1 March 1943.|$|E

25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 1st century AD, {{steering}} gear mounted on the stern were also quite common in Roman river and harbour craft as proved from reliefs and archaeological finds (Zwammderdam, Woerden 7). A tomb plaque of Hadrianic age shows a harbour <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> in Ostia with a long stern-mounted oar for better leverage. Interestingly, the boat already featured a spritsail, adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel. Further attested Roman uses of stern-mounted steering oars includes barges under tow, transport ships for wine casks, and diverse other ship types. Also, the well-known Zwammerdam find, a large river barge at the mouth of the Rhine, featured a large steering gear mounted on the stern. According to new research, the advanced Nemi ships, the palace barges of emperor Caligula (37-41 AD), may have featured 14 m long rudders.|$|E
25|$|The actual salvage {{started in}} February 1902. The forty workers used heavy timber to {{construct}} skids {{to direct the}} schooner {{into the water and}} used hydraulic jackscrews to dislodge her from the sand onto the skids, while the Wallowas engines were used to pull the Minnie A. Caine towards the water. The schooner was moved 45 feet, but procedure had to be restarted in April, as a March storm destroyed weeks of work, pushing the schooner where it originally was. Finally, the vessel was dragged 85 feet towards the water, and the Wallowa was making the final pull, but her power was insufficient to drag the schooner into the water. On May 4, a more powerful tug Tyee from Puget Sound <b>Tug</b> <b>Boat</b> Co. was chartered, but only after simultaneous application of two tugs — the Tyee and the Tacoma on May 9, 1902, the Minnie A. Caine was finally afloat.|$|E
25|$|Old Town {{opened in}} 1989 as Canada Creek and is themed around the Canadian Rockies. It has five attractions, a Burger King and the Wild Wings Noodle Bar. The main {{ride in the}} area is Saw - The Ride a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter with a 100-degree drop and 3 inversions. It {{is based on the}} Saw {{franchise}} and the coaster's station and indoor area is themed as a sawmill. The area also houses the Rocky Express, a small Mack Seastorm ride, Timber <b>Tug</b> <b>Boat</b> and Lumber Jump, a Zamperla rockin' tug and jumpin' star, both relocated to the resort from the Weymouth SeaLife Adventure Park and Marine Sanctuary. The area also houses the now defunct Slammer, an S Sky Swat. Lastly, the Loggers Leap log flume is currently closed until further notice while essential remedial work and decisions around the ride's future are made. It has been closed since 2015.|$|E

25|$|Captain Schettino {{participated in}} three {{telephone}} calls with the cruise line's crisis management officer. At 22:26, Schettino told the Port of Livorno's harbour master {{that the ship}} had taken water through {{an opening in the}} port side and requested a <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> Port authorities were not alerted to the collision until 22:42, about an hour after the impact, and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until 22:50. Some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore, while others, ready to evacuate the vessel, were delayed by crew members up to 45 minutes, as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats. Some sources report that the ship did not list until 23:15 and therefore if Schettino had given the order to abandon ship, the lifeboats could have been launched earlier, allowing the passengers to reach safety. In contrast, one expert stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} tow vessel, {{also called}} emergency towing vessel, (ETV) is a multi purpose boat used by state authorities to tow disabled vessels on high seas {{in order to}} prevent dangers to man and environment. The disabled vessel is either towed to a safe haven or kept in place against wind and current until commercial assistance by tug boats has arrived on site or until it has been repaired to the extent of being able to manoeuvre on its own. The need for ETVs as a preventive measure has arisen since the number of available commercial salvage tugs was reduced while potential dangers from individual vessels have increased. E.g. Spain has fourteen, Turkey has eleven, Germany operates eight, Norway has seven, France has five, Sweden three and the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Iceland and Finland each have one official emergency <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> Australia also operates emergency response vessels. The United Kingdom's four strong ETV fleet was to be disbanded in September 2011 due to budget cuts but the two vessels operating in Scottish waters received an extension of contract until the end of 2011.|$|E
25|$|Following this {{breakthrough}} film, {{his career}} quickly grew as Holden played {{a series of}} roles that combined good looks with cynical detachment, including a prisoner-of-war entrepreneur in Stalag 17 (1953), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, a pressured young engineer/family man in Executive Suite (1954), an acerbic stage director in The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly, a conflicted jet pilot in the Korean War film The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), a wandering college football star in Picnic (1955), a dashing war correspondent in Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), his most widely recognized role as an ill-fated prisoner in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) with Alec Guinness, a World War II <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> captain in The Key (1958), and an American Civil War military surgeon in John Ford's The Horse Soldiers (1959) opposite John Wayne. He played a number of sunnier roles in light comedy, such as the handsome architect pursuing virginal Maggie McNamara in the controversial Production Code-breaking The Moon Is Blue (1953), as Judy Holliday's tutor in Born Yesterday (1950), and as a playwright captivated by Ginger Rogers' character in Forever Female (1953).|$|E

500|$|Ambulances {{responded to}} the scene from across twelve counties, and firefighters from three. The United States Coast Guard closed off the river in the area, and a {{firefighting}} <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> was used to douse the resulting fire from the river. A helicopter was used to search the river for anyone {{who may have been}} thrown into it by the blast. Refinery workers were brought in to assist with search and rescue operations, as emergency services personnel were unfamiliar with the plant's layout. Red Cross worker Joyce Baker {{was among the first to}} arrive at the scene.

A schooner carrying seven people sunk with no survivors. A <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge, the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American S. S. Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba; all 30 crew members drowned.

500|$|Soon after departing the Desbrosses Street Pier {{on its way}} to Albany in {{the morning}} fog of 1 June 1926, Washington Irving was struck, a little after 9:00am, by one of two oil barges being pushed by the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> Thomas E. Moran. [...] The {{collision}} damaged Washington Irvings starboard side below the water line just aft of amidships, allowing water to rush into the engine rooms. The collision resulted in a hole measuring [...] long and [...] wide. The Captain, David H. Deming, ordered all passengers to put on life preservers and whistled the [...] "Ship's afire" [...] signal of two long and three short blasts repeatedly. A chaos of shouts prevailed as the passengers tried to don life vests and locate their children in the fog. An inability to see any land increased the alarm of the passengers despite the Captain's shouts that all would be safe and he ordered the jazz band to resume playing their music and maintain their post until rescue.|$|E

500|$|In November 1998, Massachusetts {{was closed}} to the public in advance of her planned {{departure}} for Boston, where she was scheduled to undergo an overhaul. She departed on her [...] trip to the capital at 06:30 4 November 1998 with a <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> moving her under the Braga, Mt. Hope and Newport Bridges, then up the coast to Boston. She arrived 7 November and entered Boston's Drydock Number 3, where an inspection determined the battleship was in need of additional steel plating along her hull at the water line to protect against sea water corrosion. In addition, the survey also located leaking rivets and identified a need to remove two of the battleship's propellers for repair purposes. For the next four months Massachusetts underwent repairs to correct these problems, including the addition of nearly [...] of steel to her hull and the addition of a compound known as Red Hand Epoxy to encase and protect the hull against further deterioration. In March 1999 Massachusetts emerged from her dry docking period and returned under tow to Battleship Cove, arriving at her berth at 15:30 13 March 1999 to a crowd of citizens, dignitaries, veterans, and civic officials.|$|E
