The APCI-MS set-up enabled detection of basic, neutral, and acidic compounds, whereas apolar and ionic compounds could not be detected. In the positive ion mode, analytes could be detected in the entire <b>transfer</b> <b>voltage</b> range (0 – 5 kV), whereas highest signal intensities were observed when the corona discharge current was between 1000 and 2000 nA. In the negative ion mode, the <b>transfer</b> <b>voltage</b> typically was 500 V and the optimum corona discharge current was 6000 nA. Analyte signals were raised with increasing nebulizing gas pressure, but the pressure was limited to 25 psi to avoid siphoning and current drops.

Thus, it is a commonly used interface between {{the physical world}} and the current signal processing systems. In order not to affect the performances of the main current signal processing system, high-performance transconductor structures need to be designed. The major concerns of modern analog systems include lower power dissipation and wider bandwidth {{in addition to the}} application related performances, such as, high gain, high linearity and so on. Unlike most researches that have been conducted on improving the single performance of a transconductor structure, a systematic methodology which targets on the performance-power ratio of CMOS transconductors is proposed in this work. The objective function defined for optimizing the performance-power ratio is a transconductor's frequency versus power ratio. The significance of the frequency-power ratio is that it represents how much bandwidth a structure can achieve while consuming unit DC power. A transconductor structure with maximal frequency-power ratio provides wider bandwidth than the structure with non-maximal frequency-power ratio when both consume the same DC power; or on the other hand, the structure with maximal frequency-power ratio consumes less DC power than the non-maximized structure when both operate at the same bandwidth.

A new design layout is {{proposed for the}} double spin qubits co-integrated with a single electron electrometer, a waveguide and a nanomagnet. This platform aims to demonstrate the full operation of double spin qubits by integrating the following three key techniques in one compact footprint: a precisely controlled single electron transfer technology, a high speed charge detection technique and a single spin detection technology based on spin to charge conversion. A single electron transfer device (SETD) integrated with an electrometer is introduced here as the main building block of the spin qubit platform. The single electron transfer device consists of three nanowire (MOSETs connected in series, and is capacitively coupled to an SET electrometer. A unique layout design for the SETD and a novel single electron <b>transfer</b> <b>voltage</b> pulse sequence are introduced. Simulation and dynamic analysis of this device operation are preformed using a finite element capacitance based simulation method and a Monte Carlo based single electron circuit simulation. The simulations demonstrated the ability of this platform to transfer single electrons and these characteristics are analyzed to optimize the layout.
