5|$|The {{initiative}} {{to construct a}} citywide wireless internet network, initiated in 2003 by city councilmember Gary Schiff, aimed to both offer city residents with wireless access for around $20 per month, and also to improve city services such as fire and police by giving them greater access to information while en route or on-site anywhere in the city. Bridging <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this is known as <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide.</b> A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

After assessing <b>the</b> level of <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> impact and <b>the</b> level of participation in ICT projects one may choose either to take mitigatory measures or to accept consequences of <b>the</b> unchecked <b>digital</b> <b>divide.</b> This paper however does not consider accepting the impact as one of its strategic choices, as such, proposes a strategy matrix which presents best possible strategic options one can pursue to curb <b>the</b> ever growing <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> gap depending on <b>the</b> nature of <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> exposure...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{second level}} <b>digital</b> <b>divide,</b> also {{referred}} to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the internet from the producers of content. As <b>the</b> technological <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> is decreasing between those with access to the internet and those without, the meaning of <b>the</b> term <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> is evolving. Previously, <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with an increasing number of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.|$|R

25|$|Important {{structural}} changes in post-Mao China after Reform and Opening, beginning under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, {{must be considered}} in relation to <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide.</b> The current urban-rural dual structure—or market-driven versus government-centered—is the underlying cause of the urban-rural divide. <b>The</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> between the two sectors could potentially intensify the current economic differences, causing more inequalities between the rural and urban sectors.

25|$|The gap {{caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China {{and the rest of}} the world is closing. However, <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens are faced with the issues of <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> because of their income, education, or location. While China has made great strides in improving the country's communication infrastructure as well as narrowing the overall digital divide, there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|Examinations of <b>the</b> {{so-called}} <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> – commonly {{thought of}} as the divide in access and use of technology according to income – have been underway for the past decade. The notion of a <b>digital</b> <b>divide,</b> which is still very real as we will see in this article, has raised concerns about how to bridge the divide. Many analysts have advocated technology access programs; but are they the right direction or are they enough. Some are calling for policies that promote digital opportunity instead (Declaration of Principles, World Summit on the Information Society, 2003) and others advocate for digital inclusion. This article will review the multiple aspects of ICT in relation to the concept social inclusion. We argue that <b>the</b> concept of <b>digital</b> inclusion as opposed to <b>the</b> concept <b>digital</b> <b>divide,</b> more accurately captures the phenomenon of ICT gaps. We conclude that because of <b>the</b> narrow <b>digital</b> <b>divide</b> frame of reference (access and use behaviour) existing policy and programs do not address the broader issues implicated in <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> gap as <b>the</b> priorities of business and e-commerc...|$|R
