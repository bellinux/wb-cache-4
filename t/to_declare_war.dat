5|$|By {{the end of}} 205 BC, Rhodes {{had been}} {{significantly}} weakened by these raids, and Philip saw his chance {{to go forward with}} the second part of his plan, direct military confrontation. He convinced the cities of Hierapytna and Olous and other cities in Eastern Crete <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> against Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{broke out}} in September 1939 with the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Germany. As in the First World War, a relatively-small BEF was sent to France and hastily evacuated from Dunkirk as the German forces swept through the Low Countries and across France in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.|$|E
50|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Soon, Germany and Britain were at war. In {{accordance}} with Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, Iraq was committed <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Germany. Instead, {{in an effort}} to maintain a neutral position, Nuri announced that Iraqi armed forces would not be employed outside of Iraq. While German officials were deported, Iraq would not <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b>|$|R
50|$|As merchantmen from Allied {{countries}} were sunk, Brazilian ships took over routes {{that had been}} vacated. However, this led the Brazilian vessels into waters patrolled by U-boats. When coupled with Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, {{the result was that}} Brazilian ships were soon lost, which drove the country closer <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on the Central Powers.|$|R
5000|$|American Revolutionary War. The United States can be {{considered}} a liberal democracy after the Continental Congress but was less than three years old. The monarchy under George III was still the final arbiter of British policy in such matters as the appointment of colonial officials and the power <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>wars.</b> The franchise was restricted to a small minority.|$|R
5|$|Sleaze-busting package: Following {{the cash}} for honours scandal, Brown {{said he would}} reduce sleaze, {{which led to the}} belief that Brown would {{introduce}} a new Ministerial Code that would set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. Brown said that he intended to strip the Prime Minister of some the powers conferred on it by royal prerogativeincluding the ability <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b> This would give Parliament more powers and rights to vet and veto appointments to senior public positions, in a bid to eliminate cronyism.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor {{was based on the}} consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors to manipulate the hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b> The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations came close <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on each other, {{although}} neither {{could afford a}} direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|R
5|$|Anonymous {{was also}} {{reported}} <b>to</b> have <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Hillary Clinton. Various outlets claiming to represent Anonymous have released {{attacks on the}} Clinton campaign.|$|R

5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
5|$|Pope Clement VIII {{wanted to}} persuade Sigismund {{to join the}} Holy League that the pope had {{organized}} against the Ottoman Empire. After Rudolph's troops defeated the Ottomans {{in a series of}} battles in the autumn of 1593, Sigismund decided to join the Holy League, provided that Rudolph acknowledged the independence of Transylvania from the Hungarian Crown. However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar Báthory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacsóczy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up an aristocratic council to administer Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement and, when that failed, <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Spain. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E
50|$|Montenegrin {{people were}} divided in clans (Pleme). Every adult male from clan was a warrior and {{took part in}} wars. Clans were ruled by chieftains, who also were {{military}} leaders of a clan. All clan leaders met up {{several times a year}} on Zbor (assembly) in Cetinje, the Montenegrin capital, to make important decisions for the nation, to solve blood feuds and <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>wars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telmessos was {{a flourishing}} {{city in the}} west of Lycia, on the Gulf of Fethiye. It was famed for its school of diviners, {{consulted}} among others by the Lydian king Croesus, prior <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> against Cyrus, and by Alexander the Great, {{when he came to}} the town after the siege of Halicarnassus.Telmessos was a member of the Delian League in the 5th century BC. It was taken by Alexander in 334 BC.|$|R
50|$|Riothamus, King of the Britons, was allied to Roman Emperor Anthemius, so {{this was}} {{tantamount}} <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on the Emperor. Arvandus was put on trial for treason. The trial should have been overseen by Sidonius, but Sidonius chose to resign his position instead, and plead for clemency {{on behalf of his}} friend. At his trial, Arvandus was found guilty and was stripped on the spot of all the privileges pertaining to his prefecture, and consigned to the common jail to await execution.|$|R
5|$|Sydney was in Alexandria harbour on 10 June 1940, {{and that}} evening learned of Italy's {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> at midnight. By 01:00 on 11 June, all ships in harbour had departed {{to search for}} Italian warships in position to attack Alexandria, and secure the sea lines of communication in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean. The Australian cruiser {{was involved in the}} westbound sweep, and sailed as far as the Gulf of Taranto during the four-day operation. Apart from an unsuccessful depth charge attack on a suspected submarine during the afternoon of 13 June, Sydney did not encounter any enemy vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 was {{the final}} and most devastating of the series of wars fought between the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. The {{previous}} war between the two powers had ended in 591 after Emperor Maurice helped the Sasanian king Khosrow II regain his throne. In 602 Maurice was murdered by his political rival Phocas. Khosrow proceeded <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> ostensibly to avenge the death of Maurice. This became a decades-long conflict, the longest war in the series, and was fought throughout the Middle East: in Egypt, the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Armenia, the Aegean Sea and even before the walls of Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|The country {{benefits}} from a highly skilled workforce and {{is among the}} most highly educated countries in the world, with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. Although Japan has officially renounced its right <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth-largest military budget, used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles. Japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and Human Development Index. Its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world. Japan is well-known internationally for its major contributions to science and modern-day technology.|$|E

5000|$|The UN responded {{the next}} day with Resolution 837, reaffirming that the {{secretary-general}} was authorized to [...] "take all necessary measures against those responsible for the armed attacks and to establish the effective authority of UNOSOM II throughout Somalia." [...] This was essentially equivalent <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Aidid and his army, a declaration that would lead to numerous confrontations between UNOSOM II personnel and Aidid's militia. UNOSOM II had much fewer war-fighting resources than UNITAF, but it was much more ambitious and aggressive.|$|R
50|$|San Marino {{was mostly}} uninvolved in the Second World War. In September 1940, press reports claimed {{that it had}} <b>to</b> have <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Britain in support of Italy; however, this was later denied by the Sammarinese government.|$|R
5|$|When a {{group of}} terrorists takes an American family hostage, Claire negotiates with their imprisoned leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), who agrees to tell his {{followers}} to release the hostages. Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on the terrorists and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that they can exploit. In the final scene, Claire finally breaks the fourth wall with Frank.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and {{had to settle for}} making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until he was assigned to flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, the British {{attacked}} Spanish ships sailing from Peru to Spain, causing Godoy <b>to</b> again <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b> On October 21, the French and Spanish fleets {{suffered a}} humiliating defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar, ending Spain's last bid to {{be a world}} power.|$|R

50|$|Spain and Britain {{had come}} into {{conflict}} during the 1720s {{over a number of}} issues, and had recently been at war with each other during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. Disputes over trade were a major cause of aggravation to Anglo-Spanish relations, combined with a fear in Britain that Spain had made an alliance with Austria as the precursor <b>to</b> <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Britain and its ally France. The British decided to try to weaken Spain and discourage them from pursuing the Austrian alliance by denying the Spanish the treasure fleets on which metropolitan Spain had become dependent.|$|R
5|$|Following Napoleon's {{defeat in}} 1814 and 1815, the reactionary Congress of Vienna {{determined}} {{that all of}} Europe should consist of strong monarchies (with the exception of Switzerland and a few insignificant republics). In France, the Bourbon dynasty was restored, replaced by the liberal July Monarchy in 1830, before the entire monarchy was again abolished during the Revolutions of 1848. The popular Napoleon III was able to proclaim himself Emperor in 1852, thus founding the Second French Empire. The kingdoms of Sicily and Naples ("Two Sicilies") were absorbed into the kingdom of Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Austria and Prussia vied to unite all German states under their banner, with Prussia emerging victorious in 1866. It succeeded in provoking Napoleon III <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> defeat France and absorb the southern German states into the German Empire in the process (1870–71). From {{the ashes of the}} Second Empire rose the French Third Republic, the only great republican European power until World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, {{after three}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso. The secret terms of this treaty {{required}} Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795, and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 195 BC, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman {{commander}} in Greece, called a {{council of the}} Greek states at Corinth to discuss whether or not <b>to</b> <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Nabis. Among the states whose delegates participated were the Aetolian League, Macedon, Rome, Pergamum, Rhodes, Thessaly and the Achaean League. All the states represented favored war, except for the Aetolian League and Thessaly, both of which wanted the Romans to leave Greece immediately. These two states offered to deal with Nabis themselves, but they met opposition from the Achaean League, which objected to any possible growth in the Aetolian League's power. The modern historian Erich Gruen {{has suggested that the}} Romans may have used the war as an excuse to station a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the Aetolian League from joining the Seleucid King Antiochus III if he invaded Greece.|$|E
