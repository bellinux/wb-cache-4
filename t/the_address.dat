5|$|The Z80 {{processor}} {{used in the}} Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, {{which means}} only 64KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16KB {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>address</b> space. The same technique was used to page between the new 16KB editor ROM and the original 16KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>address</b> space.|$|E
30|$|For {{the cache}} analysis, <b>the</b> <b>addresses</b> of <b>the</b> memory accesses {{need to be}} predicted. <b>The</b> <b>addresses</b> for <b>the</b> {{instruction}} fetch are easy to determine, and access to stack allocated data, for example, function arguments and local variables, is also quite regular. <b>The</b> <b>addresses</b> can be predicted when the call tree is known.|$|R

5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only <b>the</b> <b>address</b> of the data in memory.|$|E

50|$|When {{there are}} only a few <b>addressing</b> modes, <b>the</b> {{particular}} <b>addressing</b> mode required is usually encoded within the instruction code(e.g. IBM System/360 and successors, most RISC). But when there are lots of addressing modes, a specific field is often set aside in the instruction to specify <b>the</b> <b>addressing</b> mode. <b>The</b> DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operands for almost all instructions, and so reserved the first few bits of each operand specifier to indicate <b>the</b> <b>addressing</b> mode for that particular operand.Keeping <b>the</b> <b>addressing</b> mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an orthogonal instruction set.|$|R
