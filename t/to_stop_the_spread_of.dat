5|$|The US government's {{response}} to this announcement was the adoption of containment, the goal of which was <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million {{to intervene in the}} war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. Even though the insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Earth in which sapient birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society {{for reasons that are}} hinted at, but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game. In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly wipes out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers in a desperate attempt <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E

25|$|Missouri and Arkansas sent {{settlers}} into Kansas {{all along}} its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes {{in favor of}} slavery.

25|$|The Spanish Civil War exposed {{political}} divisions across Europe. The {{right and}} the Catholics supported the Nationalists {{as a way to}} stop the expansion of Bolshevism. On the left, including labor unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> fascism. Anti-war and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War had the potential of escalating into a second world war. In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the ossuary used to be closed with a grill and a wooden door, which were destroyed by vandals who also destroyed several wooden coffins and stole some skulls and other bones.

40|$|Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is {{spreading}} on agricultural fields in Germany, mainly in Brandenburg and Bayern. Competitive crops like winter cereals and oilseed-rape can reduce growth of this plant better than spring crops.

25|$|In {{the view}} of the State Department under President Harry S Truman, the United States needed to adopt a {{definite}} position on the world scene or fear losing credibility. The emerging doctrine of containment (as opposed to rollback) argued that the United States needed to substantially aid non-communist countries <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Soviet influence. There was also some hope that the Eastern Bloc nations would join the plan, and thus be pulled out of the emerging Soviet bloc, but that did not happen.|$|E

The Ministry of Education has also decided to call on all schools nationwide to have a winter break a month earlier in an approach <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease {{due to the fact}} that the majority of fatalities caused by the disease are people younger than 23 years of age.|$|E
5000|$|Biological {{management}} {{in the use of}} the vine's natural enemies <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> and diminish <b>the</b> population of Cynanchum louiseae. In the United States, Cynanchum louiseae has no natural enemies, but in its native Europe, certain caterpillars, beetles, and diseases attack the plant. Researchers at Cornell University and the USDA have investigated the use of natural enemies as a way to control the plant. The use of natural enemies is controversial, because the implications of adding more non-native species to threatened areas is unknown. In 2014 Hypena caterpillars were released in Ontario, Canada to help control Cynanchum's spread.|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} {{inhabited}} until 1855, when the Lord Proprietor Augustus Smith removed the remaining population from the island. By this point, {{the population was}} found to be suffering from severe deprivation—particularly due to a diet of limpets and potatoes—and consisted of only two families: the Woodcocks and the Webbers. Smith then built a deer park on the island, but the deer escaped from their stone walled enclosure, and some attempted to wade across to Tresco (at low tide). In August 1933 a major fire occurred which was put out by the staff of Major Dorrien-Smith, by digging ditches <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Svenska Federationen {{presented}} petitions to {{the governor}} of Stockholm in 1880 and 1902, and to the monarch in 1883.

A government committee was formed, which presented their suggestion in 1910. The reglementation system was finally abolished in Sweden by the Lex Veneris Act of 1918. At the time of its abolition, the reglementation was already abolished in all cities where it had occurred except in the capital itself.|$|R
