40|$|The present essay aims to {{elucidate}} Merleau-Ponty's attitude towards science {{in his early}} published works. Being a phenomenologist, he refuses to understand science {{as a tool to}} discover general natural laws valid once for all and for everyone which are supposedly {{to be found in the}} reality inaccessible to our so called naive experience. However, he esteems the gestalt psychology because in his eyes this scientific field founds its conceptions on the lived-world without mistaking these very conceptions as only reality when compared the lived-world itself. We aim to apprehend Merleau-Ponty's attitude relative to these two types of scientific approach as a dialogue through which he establishes his own thinking. The research starts with Husserl's discovery of the lived-world, or, in other words, of the original soil of our experience preceding all philosophical reflexion as well as all scientific construction. This effort ought <b>to</b> <b>helps</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> understanding the reasons of Merleau-Ponty's critique of causal thinking and realistic science. In the next step, we will present the notions of "behavior" and "form" used in the framework of gestalt psychology. This elucidation will gradually lead us to the outlines of the manner in which Merleau-Ponty extends this psychological concept to the field of philosophy. Last [...] ...|$|R

The single [...] "Operation Spirit (The Tyranny of Tradition)" [...] went to number nine on the Modern Rock chart and was followed by their debut album, 1991's Mental Jewelry, which Harrison again produced.

30|$|Learning {{strategies}} are social innovations of the past. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> cope <b>with</b> {{problems in the}} past, they were developed, imitated, spread and codified into practices, rules and institutions. They lose their usefulness if {{the conditions of the}} present differ markedly from those of the past that gave rise to the then successful strategies. Our world is markedly different from the past. Thus, we need to introduce new learning strategies to be able to cope with the conditions of the present. And since one key characteristic of the present is a fast turbulence, we need to accelerate our rate of introduction of social innovations. We suggest scenarios as tool to do so.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a novel inference method <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> deal <b>with</b> {{the problem of}} having sparse information about the user. The information we will have available for the user will form his/her model. That model will be represented in a conceptual graph format. We will also have gathered information about categories of users that share characteristics, preferences and interests. These will form the &quot;prototypes&quot;, as we call them and will be represented in graphs as well. Because we will know significantly more about the prototypes, {{they will be the}} source where we will try to get the information we want for the user. This method has been implemented in FRIL [2, 3, 10]. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes on}} the {{difficult}} task of trying to ascertain the practicality of discourse as a means toward establishing a more democratic public administration. Of concern are the methods currently used to evaluate the authenticity of such endeavors, particularly Fox and Miller’s warrants for discourse, which have something of a reliability problem. This particu-lar work suggests the use of more systematic ways to examine discursive behavior, either in lieu of or in conjunction with the warrants. These are called empirical referents, and are in-clusion, self-regulation, and policy outputs. Use of these empirical referents is intended <b>to</b> <b>help</b> provide <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a clearer focus for our discourse about the process of policy implemen-tation and the attainment of tenable results...|$|R

[...] The recording process began in May 2012, and the group attempted to get Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan to participate to some degree by sending him a message over Twitter, although Corgan did not end up participating. The Chariot scheduled time to record One Wing for three weeks, followed by one week of mixing. Scogin said this is the ideal amount of time to record as too much time causes the band to over-think things, but too little time will cause the band to [...] "start to agree to anything." ...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{adequacy}} matters directly - as it {{does for}} antirealists - if we aim to get {{all or most of}} the observable facts right, or indirectly - {{as it does}} for realists - as a symptom that the claims we make about the theoretical facts are right. But why should getting the facts - either theoretical or empirical - right be required of an acceptable theory? Here we endorse two other jobs that good theories are expected <b>to</b> do: <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a) understanding and b) managing the world. Both are of equal, often greater, importance than getting a swathe of facts right, and empirical adequacy fares badly in both.

40|$|These {{two books}} {{represent}} strikingly different {{responses to the}} events of September 11; indeed, in some respects, they encompass radically divergent human reactions to tragedy of any sort. "The Worlds in Collision" collection is mostly cool, analytic and carefully reasoned; it contains a pooling of ideas from many different sources, an academic symposium in print. John Carroll's book is highly personal, rhetorical and passionately grim. He calls it 'a meditation', but the tone is not one of quiet reflection, but of prophetic jeremiad. Ken Booth and Tim Dunne want <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> cope <b>with</b> an urgent political problem; Carroll wants to indict a spiritual disease and issue a call for cultural reform. The stock-in-trade of most of the contributors to "Worlds in Collision" is argument; for Carroll it is primarily metaphor...|$|R

Except for the Sreekovil portion all other scenes were completed in one schedule. We had erected a set in Calicut where the Sreekovil with the idol where close up shots were taken. It was because in the temple which was used for our shooting there were no regular Poojas taking place and more over it was such a cramped place and customs prevent you from entering it too for placing lights etc. For other outdoor locations, we used the steps on the riverside at Thirumittakode temple for the parting song and a cave nearby for the rain sequence which was done with the help of fire engines."

5000|$|Dosage {{marked a}} change in {{recording}} and style for Collective Soul. Unhappy with the production and sound of the previous album Disciplined Breakdown, the band focused more on production and technique for the recording of Dosage. The result led to an arduous six-month recording period where according to guitarist Dean Roland: [...] "The way we recorded Dosage, we were really meticulous about everything that we did for that record." [...] More than before the band progressed to a high production pop-rock sound. This status was obvious with the extensive use of loops, Pro Tools effects, and synth-pop sounds, especially {{in comparison with the}} band's previous three albums which are more organic and raw in sound. [...] "Anthony brought an unbelievable spirit and attitude" [...] Ed continues, [...] "He has more gadgets than we do so we all had a good time just plugging stuff in and seeing what sounds would work". Dean Roland [...] " [...] We started working with Anthony J. Resta when we recorded Dosage and we just met him through another friend of ours. And initially, he just came in <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> some programming ideas and drum arrangements, he’s an amazing drummer and he’s got that natural rhythmic thing going on. So he came in there and helped us with some of those things and that relationship just grew into other things you know like ultimately co-producing and co-writing with us. He’s just a great soul, a great spirit to have around when you’re working and creating.|$|E
