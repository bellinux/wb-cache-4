40|$|Home/school/{{community}} {{factors of}} student jobs, extracurricular activities, church activities, community activities, family activities, and television watching were examined {{to determine the}} relationship between these factors and the <b>time</b> students <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework. Two hundred forty-seven high school students were used as subjects. A student time log and questionnaire were developed and used to collect the data. Eight students were closely examined through case studies. When <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework was correlated with <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> at a job, the results were strongly negative (r = -. 89). <b>Time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework was moderately correlated (r= +. 46) with <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in extracurricular activities.

When <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework was correlated with <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> watching television, the results were strongly negative (r = -. 77). No statistically significant difference was found between the number of conflicts above average students reported doing homework and the number of conflicts below average students reported doing homework.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies of homework in core academic subjects, positive student attitudes toward homework were linked to higher achievement, whereas <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework showed an inconsistent relationship with achievement. This study examined the generalizability of these findings to foreign language learning by analyzing 2, 342 adult students' attitudes toward assigned homework, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> assigned homework, and achievement outcomes {{in a variety of}} foreign language courses. Student ratings of the relevance of homework, the usefulness of feedback provided on homework, and the fairness of homework grading were positively correlated with teacher-assigned grades and standardized proficiency test scores in listening, reading, and speaking. Reported <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework, however, was negatively correlated with these measures. In hierarchical regression analyses, all homework-related variables emerged as significant predictors of outcomes after controlling for potential covariates such as language learning aptitude, demographic variables, and affective factors. Thus, these results provide evidence that language course outcomes are positively associated with attitudes toward homework but negatively associated with <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> homework. Possible interpretations of these findings are discussed. We suggest that the negative association follows in part from the opportunity cost of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> assigned homework, which decreases <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> individualized study that may be more beneficial for improving language course outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accurate {{measures}} {{of physical activity}} are highly needed. We evaluated the test-retest reliability and {{construct validity of the}} self-report Activity Questionnaire for Adults and Adolescents (AQuAA). The AQuAA is a commonly used questionnaire in Dutch youth. Methods. In the test-retest reliability study, 53 adolescents and 58 adults completed the AQuAA twice, with an interval of two weeks. In the validity study, 33 adolescents and 47 adults wore an accelerometer (Actigraph) during two weeks, and subsequently completed the AQuAA. Results. In adolescents the test-retest reliability was fair to moderate (intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 59). In adults the test-retest reliability was fair to moderate for the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> sedentary, light and moderate intensity activities (ICCs ranging from 0. 49 to 0. 60), but poor for <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> vigorous activities (ICC = - 0. 005). The correlations between the AQuAA and Actigraph were low and nonsignificant. Compared with the Actigraph, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> all physical activities was significantly higher according to the questionnaire (except for light intensity activities in adolescents), while <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> sedentary behaviours was significantly lower. Conclusion. Reliability of the AQuAA is fair to moderate. The validity of the AQuAA compared to an accelerometer is poor. Both adolescents and adults underestimate the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> sedentary behaviours and overestimate the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> physical activities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The cost of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> {{exercise}} {{is an important}} factor in societal-perspective health economic analyses of interventions aimed at promoting physical activity. However, there are no existing measuring methods for estimating time costs. The aim of this article is to describe a way to measure the costs of <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> physical activity. We propose a model for measuring these time costs, and present the results of a pilot study applying this model to different groups of exercisers. Methods We began this investigation by developing a model for measuring the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> exercise, based on the most important theoretical frameworks for valuing time. In the model, the value of utility in anticipation (expected health benefits) of performing {{exercise is}} expressed in terms of health-related quality of life. With this approach, the cost of the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> exercise is defined as the value of utility in use of leisure activity forgone minus the value of utility in use of exercise. Utility in use for exercise is valued in comparison with utility in use for leisure activity forgone and utility in use for work. To put the model into practice, we developed a questionnaire with the aim of investigating the valuations made by exercisers, and applied this questionnaire among more experienced and less experienced exercisers. Results Less experienced exercisers valued the <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> exercise as being equal to 26 % of net wages, while more experienced exercisers valued this time at 7 % of net wages (p Conclusion The <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> exercise {{is an important factor}} in interventions aimed at promoting physical activity, and should be taken into consideration in cost-effectiveness analyses.

A total of 152 persons (i. e., 76 couples), mainly working in academia, took part in our study. Using multilevel path analysis, we found support for the general control-theoretical approach. Relationship quality was positively and relationship hassles were negatively associated with <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> work.

Results showed that <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> instant messengers and social network sites was positively associated with quality of offline friendships. Against our expectations, results from longitudinal regression analyses indicated that this association seems to result from the fact that higher friendship quality predicts more subsequent <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> IM and SNS, whereas more <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> IM and SNS does not seem to enhance friendship quality.

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a health}} problem among {{adolescents}} worldwide and television (TV) viewing could promote it in several ways. Objective: To determine {{the association between}} <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing and obesity considering economic status and residential area in primary schoolchildren {{in the north of}} Iran. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on primary schoolchildren from 112 schools. Schools and students were chosen by cluster sampling. All children completed a questionnaire containing questions on the socio-economic condition. Overweight and obesity were classified based on the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) values with body mass index (BMI) in excess of the 85 th and 95 th percentiles, respectively. Daily <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing was classified into 3 groups: less than 1 hour or no watching, 1 - 2 hours and 3 hours or over. SPSS 16. 0 software was used for statistical data analysis. Results: Study population comprised 7, 453 primary schoolchildren (urban 3, 662, rural 3, 791). Of the subjects 52. 7 viewed TV for 3 hours or more. In boys, prevalence of obesity had a positive association with TV viewing time but in girls, it was not a steady trend. In urban areas, <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing was in line with obesity but wasting significantly decreased with more <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing (P= 0. 001). This association was not seen in rural children. In the poor economic group, prevalence of obesity significantly decreased with more <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing (P= 0. 041) but this trend was not found in the moderate economic group. In the good economic group, the association between obesity and <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the TV viewing was not significant. Conclusion: About half of Iranian northern schoolchildren spent 3 hours or more daily viewing TV. A positive association between <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> TV viewing and obesity was seen in high income families and in urban areas...|$|R

50|$|Foundresses need {{to leave}} the nest to gather prey, nest {{materials}} and water. When she does {{so there is a}} risk that conspecific females will depredate her brood. These females fly to a nest, pull out a single larva and return to their own nests to feed their own larva with it. Foundresses chase off attacking females by spiral flight, whereby two females fly in the air in a double helix pattern. Attendance on nests successfully deters attacking females. Foundresses use the loss of a larva as a cue to assess predation risk, and increase their defense efforts in response. When a larva is removed, lone foundresses increase the total <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> the nest by decreasing <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>on</b> each off nest activities, and increasing the time interval between consecutive activities.
