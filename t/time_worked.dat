In 1936, a group called the Arkansas-Mississippi-Alabama US 82 Association was formed to raise funds for the bridge. In 1937, Milton C. Smith (the mayor at that <b>time)</b> <b>worked</b> with John A. Fox, (the secretary of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce), to get Congress to pass a law authorizing the bridge. The bill authorizing the bridge was signed into law in August 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938, Smith applied for money from the Works Progress Administration to fund the estimated $4.5 million it would take to build the bridge. The Works Progress Administration agreed to the proposal in September 1938, and construction started on the bridge a few months later.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, the Athenians had some disadvantages at Marathon. In order {{to face the}} Persians in battle, the Athenians had to summon all available hoplites; and even then they were still probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1. Furthermore, raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any secondary attack in the Athenian rear would cut the army off from the city; and any direct attack on the city could not be defended against. Still further, defeat at Marathon would mean the complete defeat of Athens, since no other Athenian army existed. The Athenian strategy was therefore to keep the Persian army pinned down at Marathon, blocking both exits from the plain, and thus preventing themselves from being outmaneuvered. However, these disadvantages were balanced by some advantages. The Athenians initially {{had no need to}} seek battle, since they had managed to confine the Persians to the plain of Marathon. Furthermore, <b>time</b> <b>worked</b> in their favour, as every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer. Having everything to lose by attacking, and much to gain by waiting, the Athenians remained on the defensive in the run up to the battle. Tactically, hoplites were vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and since the Persians had substantial numbers of cavalry, this made any offensive maneuver by the Athenians even more of a risk, and thus reinforced the defensive strategy of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} London Transport steam {{passenger train}} on the branch left Chesham at 12.11am on 12 September 1960. 1,917 passengers used {{the line that}} day, in comparison with a typical Sunday usage of around 100. Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present {{at the opening of}} the line, rode the steam shuttle to Chalfont& Latimer and back, and attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published timetables. This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam-powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this <b>time</b> <b>worked</b> by a British Rail diesel multiple unit, was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains.|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{part time}} {{employment}} {{over the past}} forty years represents {{a fundamental change in}} the Australian labour market. Part time employment has become {{an important component of the}} range of working arrangements and represents an example of the labour market’s response to economic and social changes. It has been associated with increased diversity of the workforce and contributed to changes in workplace culture and attitudes towards work. There has been considerable debate about the reasons underlying the growth in part <b>time</b> <b>work</b> and whether it has been beneficial for individuals and the community as a whole. Indeed, some part <b>time</b> <b>work</b> is seen as a stop gap where full time employment is desired but cannot be achieved — these are the involuntary part time employed. But part <b>time</b> <b>work</b> also enables individuals to combine work with other activities such as undertaking studies or raising a family. More recently, it is being used increasingly to enable workers to transition more slowly to retirement.   This paper identifies who are part time workers; explores some suggested reasons why part <b>time</b> <b>work</b> has grown rapidly; examines the role it plays in response to changes in labour market conditions and individuals’ lives; identifies the nature and conditions of part <b>time</b> <b>work</b> and the contribution it makes to household income.  ...|$|R

25|$|The plan as at early 1982 was for all 54 {{carriages}} (not yet 57) to be {{in service}} {{by the end of}} 1983, running services to Warrnambool, Horsham, Shepparton, Geelong and some Bendigo services. All other services were to be provided by the existing S, Z and airconditioned E carriages, plus interurban Comeng type trains running to Traralgon. All carriages were to be formed into semi-fixed 3 or 4-car sets, with schedules built around standard consists to keep runs fast and simple. Additionally, all sets were to include only one conductor/guard van, rather than one each end, to maximise capacity for length and weight of each train set. The roster at the <b>time</b> <b>worked</b> with fourteen interurban trains (plus four on the electrified eastern region), so that would allow enough N sets spare and in rostered maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Another {{catalyst}} for change came in 1926, when Field Marshal the Lord Byng of Vimy, then Governor General of Canada, refused {{the advice of}} his prime minister (William Lyon Mackenzie King) in what came to be known colloquially as the King–Byng Affair. Mackenzie King, after resigning and then being reappointed as prime minister some months later, pushed at the Imperial Conference of 1926 for a reorganisation of the way the Dominions related to the British government, resulting in the Balfour Declaration, which declared formally that the Dominions were fully autonomous and equal in status to the United Kingdom. What this meant in practice was not at the <b>time</b> <b>worked</b> out; conflicting views existed, some in the United Kingdom not wishing to see a fracturing of the sacred unity of the Crown throughout the empire, and some in the Dominions not wishing to see their jurisdiction have to take on the full brunt of diplomatic and military responsibilities.|$|E
