5|$|Since {{the death}} of his young {{daughter}} from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he has raised more than £1 million for research into childhood leukaemia. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been used to fund projects {{to improve the lives of}} children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest {{managerial}} disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale … only the blind, or the biased, can now think that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.|$|E

25|$|Alan Bonsell testified. His {{testimony}} initially {{included a}} claim {{that he did not}} know where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been raised to donate sixty copies of Of Pandas and People to the school's library. On hearing that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>had</b> been raised in William Buckingham's church, and directed through Bonsell's father so that it might be donated anonymously, Jones elected to take over the examination of Bonsell himself, questioning him for about ten minutes.|$|R
25|$|Mr Wilson {{initiated}} {{this link}} after visiting Babati in 2002. The school has now raised several thousand pounds altogether to support Babati Day, all pupils {{taking part in}} fund raising.

25|$|Regardless of the {{difficulty}} in measurement, {{the amount of money}} laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> come from, and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going to).|$|E
25|$|Toadie and Sonya {{decide to}} enlist Nell in {{childcare}} when she begins playing up, believing {{she does not}} get enough attention. During an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E

500|$|Equitable tracing's {{greatest}} strength {{is its ability}} to trace into mixtures of money. Different rules apply in different situations; where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been mixed with the money of a trustee, where a trust fund has been mixed with another trust fund (or money belonging to an innocent volunteer), and where money has been transferred by mistake rather than malicious intent. Where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been mixed with the money of a trustee, the court's decision depends on the motive of the trustee. Because a trustee is expected to invest trust property and behave honestly, the courts may choose to find that the trustee transferred the money to further the goal of the trust. Since the trustee is assumed to behave honestly, any profits made may be assumed (by this [...] "convenient fiction") to be made by the trust money, and any losses from the trustee's personal funds.|$|E
2500|$|It can be argued, {{the quality}} of aid differs as [...] "aid" [...] is an {{ambiguous}} term that may cover {{a wide variety of}} methods, including 'soft' loans (where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> to be repaid with interest albeit at below market rates), and 'tied aid' (where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> to be spent buying goods and services from the donating country). The terms by which the aid is accepted play a large role in determining how useful it is and also affect the relative cost to the donating country.|$|E
2500|$|The {{partnership}} is [...] overseeing {{the investment of}} £4.5billion in transport projects in the region.

2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the Foundation and its members {{attorney}} Andrew J. Pincus, co-director of the Yale Law School Supreme Court Clinic, addressed the Court. He {{said that there was}} nothing in Judicial history declaring that for standing to be allowed within Flast <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> to go outside the Government. For an example he pointed out that [...] "the lower courts and this Court at least in part have found taxpayer standing to challenge the salaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the Government".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, the College {{announced}} a $50 million gift from Ernest Scheller Jr, a Georgia Tech alumnus and {{former chairman of}} Silberline Manufacturing, a Philadelphia-based pigment manufacturer. This $50MM included the $25MM that had been given by Ernest Scheller, Jr. anonymously in 2009. [...] It was the largest cash gift in Georgia Tech's history. As a result, the College of Management was renamed the Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been used to double the College's endowment, grow the faculty, and strengthen the Ph.D. programs, among other uses.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the Town has often {{approved}} progressive social initiatives, including domestic partnership registration. In 1999, it imposed a 2 percent tax on {{residential real estate}} sales in excess of $250,000 {{for the purpose of}} buying open space for preservation. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been used in part to the Town's establishing more than [...] of trails, including the Paumanok Path. Between 2002 and 2005, the tax raised $71 million. In 2006, the Town adopted a dark skies ordinance, which is now being considered as a model for wider use in New York State to cut down on light pollution at night.|$|E

2500|$|It {{can take}} {{anywhere}} from {{a month or so}} to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. [...] At the time when all of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> been raised, the fund is said to be closed, and the 10-year lifetime begins. [...] Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. [...] The vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison. This shows the difference between a venture capital fund management company and the venture capital funds managed by them.|$|E
2500|$|... "Lottery Fever" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the tenth season of the American {{animated}} television series Family Guy. The 166th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 25, 2011. The episode follows the Griffin family after they win the state lottery, {{and go on to}} spend the money with no regard. Peter becomes power hungry, and demands that Quagmire and Joe perform tasks for him when he invests in one of their projects. This ultimately causes the group to end their friendship, to the dismay of Peter's wife, Lois, who tells her husband that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> changed him for the worse. After continually wasting the money on various expenditures, the family discovers that they have gone broke, and return to their lives as a lower middle class family. Peter also apologizes to Quagmire and Joe, repairing his broken friendships.|$|E
2500|$|The building's history {{includes}} multiple {{reports of}} illegal gambling. The current building web site {{notes that the}} building {{was the site of}} gambling activities around 1910, resulting in several raids by the police. In each case, however, the gamblers were tipped off to the impending raids and no evidence of gambling was discovered. In 1930 police raided the San Fernando Building again, and arrested eleven men for conducting illegal lottery operations at the building; police also arrested a woman for possession of eight quarts of liquor. The Los Angeles Times described the building as [...] "local headquarters for various well-known lotteries." [...] Police said they found thousands of tickets for the [...] "Army and Navy Veterans of Canada Sweepstakes," [...] the [...] "Cuban Sweepstakes," [...] and other chance-taking ventures, including baseball pools and [...] "bank-clearings guessing ventures." [...] Police also said one of the gamblers had robbed a Los Angeles bank, and had hidden the money somewhere in the building. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> never been found.|$|E

[...] Pincus stated that [...] "the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>has</b> to be centralthe money that's being challenged has to be central to the violation. Just as you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast". As in Bowen there had to be [...] "a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money". Pincus opined that no taxpayer would be given standing to sue agents of the United States Secret Service for accompanying a President on a trip for a religious purpose as they would be there [...] "protecting him for a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious purpose. And I think our submission {{is that there is a}} distinction that can be drawn there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Money {{laundering}} {{has been}} criminalized in the United States since the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986. The law, contained at section 1956 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits individuals {{from engaging in}} a financial transaction with proceeds that were generated from certain specific crimes, known as [...] "specified unlawful activities" [...] (SUAs). The law requires that an individual specifically intend in making the transaction to conceal the source, ownership or control of the funds. There is no minimum threshold of money, and no requirement that the transaction succeeded in actually disguising the money. A [...] "financial transaction" [...] has been broadly defined, and need not involve a financial institution, or even a business. Merely passing money {{from one person to}} another, with the intent to disguise the source, ownership, location or control of <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>has</b> been deemed a financial transaction under the law. The possession of money without either a financial transaction or an intent to conceal is not a crime in the United States. Besides money laundering, the law contained in section 1957 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits spending more than US$10,000 derived from an SUA, regardless of whether the individual wishes to disguise it. It carries a lesser penalty than money laundering, and unlike the money laundering statute, requires that the money pass through a financial institution.|$|E
