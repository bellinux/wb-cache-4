40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate, by means of numerical simulation experiments, the complex interactions between consecutive toroidally circulating buoyant elements (thermals) when these occur in either rotating or nonrotating environments. The study includes both the vortex formation process and the effect that this process has on the properties of the one or more buoyant elements involved in the interaction. A numerical model of a self-developing thermal of the Ogura type was modified to include <b>tangential</b> <b>accelerations</b> and a provision for injecting a second thermal into the field of a previous one. Computer outputs are obtained at several times during the evolution of both solitary thermals and two types of successive thermals, released at intervals of 2 and 7 min. These were also performed for three different magnitudes of pre-existing vorticity, comparable to magnitudes measured in the vicinity of thunderstorms. The results of the complex interactions are illustrated in the patterns of isotherms, stream functions, and velocity isotachs. A thermal is accelerated in circulation and velocity of rise upon encountering the wake of a previous thermal, and velocity enhancements can be quite spectacular. A rotation field causes both solitary and successive thermals to surrender part of their kinetic energy to vortex formation, but lateral confinement of the thermal slows the mixing and reduces the heat loss. The first effect tends to suppress the vertical momentum of the thermal, and the secon...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are capable}} of moving about the world in complex ways. Every time we move, our self-motion must be {{detected}} and interpreted by {{the central nervous system}} in order to make appropriate sequential movements and informed decisions. The vestibular labyrinth consists of two unique sensory organs the semi-circular canals and the otoliths that are specialized to detect rotation and translation of the head, respectively. While thresholds for pure rotational and translational self-motion are well understood surprisingly little research has investigated the relative role of each organ on thresholds for more complex motion. Eccentric (off-center) rotations during which the participant faces away from the center of rotation stimulate both organs and are thus well suited for investigating integration of rotational and translational sensory information. Ten participants completed a psychophysical direction discrimination task for pure head-centered rotations, translations and eccentric rotations with 5 different radii. Discrimination thresholds for eccentric rotations reduced with increasing radii, indicating that additional <b>tangential</b> <b>accelerations</b> (which increase with radius length) increased sensitivity. Two competing models were used to predict the eccentric thresholds based on the pure rotation and translation thresholds: one assuming that information from the two organs is integrated in an optimal fashion and another assuming that motion discrimination is solved solely by relying on the sensor which is most strongly stimulated. Our findings clearly show that information from the two organs is integrated. However the measured thresholds for 3 of the 5 eccentric rotations are even more sensitive than predictions from the optimal integration model suggesting additional non-vestibular sources of information may be involved...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a wealth}} of {{evidence}} demonstrating extraordinary maximal performance, {{little is known about}} the routine flight performance of insects. We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1. 6 m 1. 6 m 1. 6 m) corner-cube reflector using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3 -dimensional trajectories without the need for synchronisation hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3 -dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1. 2 ms− 1 and 2. 3 ms− 1, with a maximum of 2. 5 ms− 1. Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (− 2. 4 ms− 1) almost double the maximum climb rate (1. 2 ms− 1). Modal turn rate was around 240 °s− 1, with maximal rates in excess of 1700 °s− 1. We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum <b>tangential</b> <b>accelerations</b> and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g...|$|R
