5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are {{grounded}} {{in the tradition of}} John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many of the images are connected to the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. <b>The</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, {{and those of}} the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
