5|$|Military {{designation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Prototype</b> Model 28 aircraft, three built.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> aircraft, {{registered}} N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} single ski, which proved {{more successful than}} the twin-ski design of the second service test aircraft. Testing with several other experimental ski configurations continued with <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> through 1957, after which it was placed into storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{pre-production}} machines (designated Mk II) {{differed from}} <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> {{in a variety}} of ways, most importantly in using the more powerful Sapphire 7 engine in place of <b>the</b> <b>prototype's</b> Sapphire 6.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 MAN and Waggonfabrik Uerdingen both {{delivered}} two prototypes each. Even {{though they}} were quite similar, they can be distinguished easily by the different front design. DB put <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> into service as class VT 23.5 (MAN) and class VT 24.5 (Uerdingen). After the new numbering scheme <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> were listed as class 624 together with the regular units. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> underwent intensive tests, including comparison to conventional push/pull trains with DB Class V 100.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were, {{with the}} exception of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes,</b> coupled to 2'2'T34 tenders. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes,</b> 41 001 and 41 002, had 2'2'T32 tenders on delivery. From their use of 20m turntables, it is also known that some engines were running with 2'2T30 tenders.|$|R
5|$|A {{sculpture}} of <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> Spitfire, K5054, {{stands on the}} roundabout {{at the entrance to}} Southampton International Airport, which, as Eastleigh Aerodrome, saw the first flight of the aircraft in March 1936.|$|E
5|$|Henry Morgan, {{founder of}} the Morgan Motor Company who {{assembled}} <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> Morgan car at the school in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Starbursts {{are often}} {{associated}} with merging or interacting galaxies. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> {{example of such a}} starburst-forming interaction is M82, which experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> {{had proved}} successful, in 1967 {{construction}} of twelve locomotives began at Krupp. Since a new numbering scheme {{was introduced in}} 1968, the locomotives were given the numbers 217 011 to 217 022 (<b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> being renumbered to 217 001 to 217 003).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>prototype</b> was {{destroyed}} in a storm {{in the fall of}} 1989 but, with insurance indemnity and by using <b>the</b> first <b>prototype’s</b> front fuselage and wings, <b>the</b> second <b>prototype</b> was built. <b>The</b> second <b>prototype</b> made its first flight in Norvajärvi on October 12, 1990.|$|R
50|$|Two prototypes {{were made}} for 1962, each with a unique body. One a {{convertible}} {{and the other a}} hardtop. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> came directly from Buick Engineering, both had been given two 4-barrel carburetors by the engineers thus increasing <b>the</b> <b>prototype's</b> horsepower a little more than 80 hp. Of note was that they had features from the '61, '62, and the '63 production models. Some features, such as the two 4-barrel carburetors, were left out of the production-line Skylarks. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> were also were 2 in longer, and wider than the production models. Of <b>the</b> two <b>prototypes,</b> only <b>the</b> hardtop still exists and resides with its owner in Michigan. It is possible <b>the</b> convertible <b>prototype</b> still exists in the Sloan Museum collection.|$|R
5|$|The S-II-a {{prototype}} and one LT vz. 35 tank {{were returning}} from {{testing in the}} Soviet Union when the fighting began. They detrained in Sevljus and participated in a counterattack at Fančíkovo, but the LT vz. 35 was damaged and captured by the Hungarians. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> was forced to retreat into Romania by 17 March, along {{with most of the}} other Czech troops in eastern Ruthenia. The Romanians returned <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> to Škoda six months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram {{were both}} {{made from a}} 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> had a special X-shaped (Tresca) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons. and <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At {{the first meeting of}} the CGPM in 1889 bar No.6 and cylinder No.X were accepted as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that one cubic decimetre {{of water at}} its maximum density was equal to 99.9265% of the target mass of the provisional kilogram standard made four years earlier. That same year, 1799, an all-platinum kilogram prototype was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at 4°C. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> {{was presented to the}} Archives of the Republic in June and on December 10, 1799, <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> was formally ratified as the kilogramme des Archives (Kilogram of the Archives) and the kilogram was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next 90 years.|$|E
30|$|The {{lesson learned}} {{that has the}} Title: Dependence between {{activities}} can cause delays in the project, occurred due to the following Situation: “The improvement of the use case depended on the delivery of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes.</b> <b>The</b> delivery of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> was delayed”. As a result, the following Consequence of the Situation was observed: “Rework. Delay of the next activity that should be delivered to another participant”. Therefore, we can notice {{that there was a}} delay in the specification of use cases, since such an artifact should represent the same information in <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> and MoLIC diagrams.|$|R
50|$|The first YAT-37D flew in October 1964, {{followed}} {{a year later}} by <b>the</b> second <b>prototype.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>prototype</b> had four stores pylons under each wing, rather than three, and <b>the</b> first <b>prototype</b> was upgraded to this configuration as well.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 <b>the</b> <b>prototypes,</b> 614 001 + 914 001 + 614 002 and 614 003 + 914 002 + 614 004, were delivered. Testing {{was carried}} out from Trier along the Moselle valley and into the Eifel. Unlike the {{production}} vehicles <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> had a tilting systems.|$|R
5|$|Victor K.2 XL231: Lusty Lindy, at the Yorkshire Air Museum, York. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> for the B.2 to K.2 conversion. XL231 {{is one of}} two Victors {{currently}} in taxiable condition.|$|E
5|$|Yak-15U (Yakovlev Yak-15U-RD10): (U - uloochshenny - improved) Improved Yak-15 with {{tricycle}} undercarriage and drop tanks, became <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> of the Yak-17 proper.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Pong, Bushnell pushed his {{employees}} to create new products. In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip {{had yet to be}} tested and built before <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> was constructed. The chip was finished {{in the latter half of}} 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Prototyping</b> in <b>the</b> {{development}} cycle claims to improve analyst understanding of system requirements leading to systems which match those requirements more closely. The {{quality of the}} end systems, from a user perspective, is thus improved. In this paper, {{the results of an}} empirical investigation into <b>the</b> use of <b>prototyping</b> in <b>the</b> development of various systems is described. Nine processes across eight different sites were analysed and data relating to each process was collected. The notation of Role Activity Diagrams (RADs) was used to capture each of the nine processes. Five hypotheses were then investigated: these related <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> role to features of other roles such as extent of interaction during <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> process, <b>the</b> effect site size had on <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> role and <b>the</b> dependence of <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> role on other roles in <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> process. Two coupling metrics were introduced to quantitatively analyse these RAD features. Results indicated a strong similarity between large and medium-sized sites in terms of interactions and behaviour. <b>The</b> <b>prototyping</b> process in small sites, how-ever, was found to be different to large and medium-sized sites in both respects. The study demonstrates how measures of business models can aid analysis of the process as well as the products of systems development and highlights the need for more empirical investigation into this and other facets of the software development process...|$|R
50|$|Whatmough {{designed}} speaker prototypes using computer programmes. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> {{were then}} tested using Audiophile Studio Recordings of Jazz, Blues and Classical music, {{because of their}} wide variety of instruments and high dynamic range. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> were then modified {{as many times as}} necessary to achieve the desired result.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>prototype,</b> <b>the</b> Pintail Mark I, flew on 7 July 1920. <b>The</b> second <b>prototype,</b> <b>the</b> Pintail Mark II had a {{lengthened}} fuselage, while <b>the</b> third <b>prototype,</b> <b>the</b> Pintail Mark III had non-retractable wheels {{within the}} floats. While the Pintail was more capable {{as a fighter}} than the Possum, offering an excellent upwards field of view for the crew, it had poor downwards view for the pilot during landing.|$|R
5|$|All {{production}} Comet 2s {{were also}} modified {{to alleviate the}} fatigue problems (most of these served with the RAF as the Comet C2), while a programme to produce a Comet 2 with more powerful Avons was delayed. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> Comet 3 first flew in July 1954, and was tested in an unpressurised state pending completion of the Cohen inquiry. Comet commercial flights would not resume until 1958.|$|E
5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards. Control of <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|Arp 220 {{hosts the}} first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy, {{and has been}} studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used {{as a guide for}} interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> of interconnected products belonging to the Internet of Things field. The chosen solution tries to merge the benefits of monolithic vertical approaches (where everything is chosen from the board to the cloud) with those of horizontal solutions (where every time all the elements can be chosen and the code for integrating them written). The proposed solution allows to speed up <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> process and to let the developers focus on coding the product behaviours instead of solving customization issues. The advantages of the proposed solution goes beyond <b>the</b> <b>prototyping,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>prototyped</b> solution can be easily converted in an industrial grade one. The paper ends with a real case application that shows how an IoT industrial refrigerator smar-tification unit has been developed thanks to the horizontal stack here proposed...|$|R
40|$|The expressiveness and {{complexity}} of several active database prototypes are formally studied. First, a generic framework for the specification of active databases is developed. This factors out the common aspects of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> considered, and allows studying various active database features independently of any specific prototype. Furthermore, each of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> can be specified by specializing certain parameters of <b>the</b> framework. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> considered are ARDL, HiPAC, Postgres, Starburst, and Sybase. Using their formal specifications, <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> are compared to each other with respect to expressive power. The results {{provide insight into the}} programming paradigm of active databases, the interplay of various features, and their impact on expressiveness {{and complexity}}. 1 Introduction The ability of a database to react to specified events is an increasingly common requirement in advanced database systems. This has led to the emergence of active databases, which provide [...] ...|$|R
5|$|At this point, Shikata {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} Link being able to enter and merge onto walls; this feature would eventually {{become one of the}} title's unique gameplay aspects. Within a day, Mouri had created an initial prototype to demonstrate the feature, and seeing it in action led to an influx of ideas. Link was able to transform from a 3D character to a 2D character by entering walls, and then move smoothly around corners to reach places he previously could not. This ability opened up possibilities for creating new puzzles and using new mechanics. At this stage in the project, they were still considering the new game to be an extension of Zelda games on the Nintendo DS, so <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> itself used the same viewpoint and design of Link from Spirit Tracks. Around October 2010, <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> was presented to Miyamoto, who approved of the new concept and was happy for development to begin. However, within two weeks of entering production, core members of the development team were reassigned to work on launch games for Nintendo's Wii U console which was scheduled for release in 2012. With the team disbanded, development of the game ceased.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Manchester Mark 1 {{began in}} August 1948, {{with the initial}} aim of {{providing}} the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given a demonstration of <b>the</b> <b>prototype,</b> and was so impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.|$|E
5|$|Each {{filter section}} type has {{particular}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} and each has the capability to improve particular filter parameters. The sections described below are <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> filters for low-pass sections. These prototypes may be scaled and transformed to the desired frequency bandform (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop).|$|E
50|$|The Vickers MBT Mk 1 was {{designed}} to be a simple, low-cost, but effective tank. <b>The</b> first <b>prototype</b> was completed in 1963. In 1964 one of <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> was sent to India.|$|R
5000|$|Flight {{testing of}} <b>the</b> <b>prototypes</b> was {{particularly}} careful and methodical, since the design was new {{in so many}} ways. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> initially suffered from [...] "Dutch roll", an instability that caused the aircraft to weave in widening [...] "S" [...] turns. This problem was remedied {{by the addition of}} a [...] "yaw damper" [...] control system that applied rudder automatically to damp out the weaving motion. <b>The</b> <b>prototypes</b> also had a tendency to pitch up. This problem was solved by adding small vanes called [...] "vortex generators" [...] onto the wings that caused turbulence to prevent airflow separation.|$|R
