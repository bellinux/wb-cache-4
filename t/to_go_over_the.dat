5|$|Brown {{was booked}} in Celtic's {{penultimate}} league game against Kilmarnock, which caused him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> disciplinary points threshold {{and receive a}} suspension {{for the first two}} matches of the 2011–12 season. Brown helped Celtic to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final, which Celtic won 3–0 against Motherwell. This allowed him to collect his first trophy as Celtic captain. Brown played 39 times for Celtic, scoring four goals, during the 2010–11 season. He was often used on the right of midfield, partly due to the form of other central midfielders such as Beram Kayal, Joe Ledley and Ki Sung-Yueng, but also because Brown is more able to play in wide areas than them.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E

Later, Legolas and Gimli travelled together through Fangorn forest and to the Glittering Caves of Helm's Deep, as Legolas had promised Gimli. Eventually, Legolas founded an Elf-colony in Ithilien and spent his remaining time helping to restore the devastated forests there. It was told in the Red Book of Westmarch (first written by Bilbo Baggins, continued by Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee and finally passed down through the Gamgee family), that after Aragorn's death in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, Legolas built a grey ship and left Middle-earth <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea to Valinor, and that Gimli went with him.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 16, {{the members}} of space shuttle Endeavours STS-134 crew {{continued}} preparations for the shuttle's landing on flight day 17. Commander Mark Kelly, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist and flight engineer Roberto Vittori performed a checkout of Endeavours Flight Control Systems (FCS). They began by starting Auxiliary Power Unit 1 (APU 1), so they could test the flight systems such as the ailerons and rudder. The APU was used to provide hydraulic pressure to power the flight control systems. The astronauts next moved on to {{a test of the}} Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. This test saw Kelly, Johnson and Vittori fire each jet once. Meanwhile, Drew Feustel, Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff stowed items on the mid-deck for their return to Earth. Later in the crew day, they stowed the Ku band antenna for re-entry. The crew also performed several experiments, including an eye exam and the Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO2) experiments, and conducted a deorbit briefing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> procedures for the landing. The entire crew furthermore participated in in-flight interviews with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and Fox News Radio, and sent a crew tribute to Endeavour down to the ground.|$|E

On February 13, he earned his first pole position at Daytona International Speedway, {{as well as his}} first at a track that uses restrictor plates. Due to a practice crash, he had to start {{at the back of the}} field for both the duel race and the 500. He finished 24th in the Daytona 500 after being wrecked with 4 laps <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next seven races, Earnhardt would achieve five Top 10 finishes, including a 2nd-place finish at Martinsville after losing the lead to Kevin Harvick with 4 laps to go, and a 4th-place finish at Talladega in a photo finish with Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Clint Bowyer, and Kevin Harvick. Earnhardt came within half a lap of snapping his then-104 race winless streak at the Coca-Cola 600 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, when he ran out of fuel during a green-white-checkered finish, finishing 7th. The following week at Kansas, Earnhardt finished 2nd to Brad Keselowski. He followed this up with a solid 6th-place finish at Pocono. Over the course of the next three races, Earnhardt would slide to 7th in the Championship points, finishing 21st at Michigan, 41st at Infineon, and 19th at Daytona. On September 1, 2011 Earnhardt announced he had signed a 5-year contract extension with Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No. 88 until 2017.

25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
