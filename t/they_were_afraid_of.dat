5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E

However, the Toronto Transit Commission union ATU Local113, rejected this operational option for its Scarborough Rapid Transit (SRT) and the vehicles were modified at high cost to include operator cabins and conventional controls as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the TTC cutting jobs. No other Innovia Metro system uses manual control.|$|E
60|$|Men <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> dying, principally, I believe, {{because they}} fear the unknown. It <b>is</b> not that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the pain of dying. It <b>is</b> not that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> going to hell. Neither <b>is</b> it that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> not going to heaven. But when they think of {{actually}} dying, they feel as if {{to go into the}} next world was to be turned out into the dark night, into an unknown land, away from house and home, and all they have known and loved; and so they shrink from death.|$|R

25|$|Many White Christians in the 18th century did not {{consider}} African Americans fully human and {{did not believe that}} they had souls. When this view changed, White Christians began to try to convert slaves to Christianity, although slave owners resisted this conversion because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> slaves revolting. In trying to convert slaves to Christianity, Christian leaders reinforced and approved slavery as well as any means of punishment for slaves who revolted. Some Christian leaders even claimed that slavery was a good thing in that it allowed, or oftentimes forced, slaves to become Christians.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{expansion}} of the Luhya people (the western neighbours of the Terik) has strained Terik-Luhyia relations during the last decades. Luhya are felt {{to be a threat}} to the Terik identity and intermarriage has drastically reduced. The {{expansion of}} the Luhya (especially the Logoli group) into Terik territory has been a cause of population pressure. This, along with dwindling agricultural potential in the area, has {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century motivated many of the Terik to move eastwards, into 'Nandiland' as they call it. Some Terik even claim that they abandoned their homeland because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the Luhya.|$|E
25|$|On October 11, 2006, Lidle and {{his flight}} {{instructor}} crashed {{a small plane}} into a 50-story condominium tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Francesa and Russo quickly went on the defensive, as they were emotionally disturbed and upset {{by the death of}} Lidle, whom they had scolded on air two days prior. They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> what their callers would say. In fact, many of the other hosts during their shows received quite a number of phone calls lambasting Francesa and Russo.|$|E

25|$|On 19 July 1824, {{the largest}} fleet {{seen in the}} Mediterranean since Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798 set sail from Alexandria, {{consisting}} of 54 warships and 400 transports carrying 14,000 French-trained infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 500 artillerymen, with some 150 cannons. Egyptian intervention was initially limited to Crete and Cyprus. However, the success of Muhammad Ali's troops in both places settled the Turks on the horns of a very difficult dilemma, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> their wāli's expansionist ambitions.

25|$|By {{the time}} Xun Xu reached adulthood, {{he was already}} a learned and {{knowledgeable}} young man.

He was subsequently reassigned to be a tongshi lang (通事郎; a communications secretary) of the Palace Writers (中書). In 249, Cao Shuang was executed after losing power in a coup launched by his co-regent, Sima Yi. None of Cao Shuang's former aides dared to collect his remains and arrange a funeral for him because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being implicated. Xun Xu stepped up, held a funeral for Cao Shuang, and inspired others to follow him.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the lifeboat buckling under the weight, others suggested {{it was because the}} crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and children first. Additionally, doors and hatches were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E

25|$|After the Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland on 17 September 1939, {{in accordance with}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact the Soviet forces were given freedom over Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, an important aspect of the agreement to the Soviet government as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Germany using the three states as a corridor to get close to Leningrad. The Soviets pressured Finland and the Baltic states to conclude mutual assistance treaties. The Soviets questioned the neutrality of Estonia following the escape of a Polish submarine from Tallinn on 18 September. A week later, on 24 September 1939, the Estonian foreign minister was given an ultimatum in Moscow. The Soviets demanded the conclusion of a treaty of mutual assistance to establish military bases in Estonia. The Estonians {{had no choice but to}} allow the establishment of Soviet naval, air and army bases on two Estonian islands and at the port of Paldiski. The corresponding agreement was signed on 28 September 1939. Latvia followed on 5 October 1939 and Lithuania shortly thereafter, on 10 October 1939. The agreements permitted the Soviet Union to establish military bases on the Baltic states' territory for the duration of the European war, and station 25,000 Soviet soldiers in Estonia, 30,000 in Latvia and 20,000 in Lithuania from October 1939.|$|E

Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Mosley {{challenged}} Balestre for {{the presidency}} of FISA. Mosley said that his decision to challenge the Frenchman was prompted by Balestre's reported intervention {{on behalf of his}} countryman Alain Prost to ensure that race stewards disqualified Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix. Mosley campaigned on the basis that Balestre, who was also president of the FIA and of the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile, could not effectively manage all these roles together. He also said that no-one challenged Balestre because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the consequences and suggested that the FISA President should not interfere with F1, which could be left to run itself. Mosley won the FISA presidency by 43 votes to 29; Balestre remained as FIA president. Mosley resigned a year later, fulfilling a promise made during his election campaign to seek a re-affirmation of his mandate. [...] "I wanted to show people that I do what I say", he said. [...] "Now they can judge me in a year's time." [...] FISA immediately re-elected him.|$|E
500|$|Conteh {{now found}} himself {{in the middle of a}} war zone, {{starving}} and homeless. He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because [...] "they had no one to help them". Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever isolation ward in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post. It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> catching Lassa fever. When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.|$|E

But the composer's refusal to modify his [...] pro-Soviet stance following the onset of the Cold War alienated both the public and the music establishment, a factor which Bush acknowledged 20 years later: [...] "People who were in a position to promote my works were afraid to do so. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being labelled". [...] Stoker comments that [...] "in a less tolerant country he would certainly have been imprisoned, or worse. But he was merely ignored, both politically, and, which is a pity, as a composer".

500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't.
