50|$|Rubylith {{is used in}} {{many areas}} of graphic design, {{typically}} to produce masks for various printing techniques. For example it is often used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> areas of a design when using a photoresist to produce printing plates for offset lithography or gravure. It is also frequently used during screen-printing.|$|E
50|$|In airbrushing, a frisket is {{a plastic}} sheet with an {{adhesive}} backing used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> {{specific areas of}} an image so that only the exposed area is covered with paint. The frisket is vital to airbrushing, because it allows the artist to control excess paint spray, create special effects, achieve extreme precision, control edge attributes and to expedite the airbrushing process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{frosted glass}} effect {{can also be}} {{achieved}} by the application of vinyl film, used {{as a sort of}} stencil on the glass surface. [...] "Photo-resist", or photo-resistant film is also available, which can be produced <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> the area surrounding a decorative design, or logo on the glass surface. A similar effect may also be accomplished with the use of canned frosted glass sprays.|$|E
50|$|Aspect ratios are {{controlled}} by the lens with the appropriate aperture plate, a piece of metal with a precisely cut rectangular hole {{in the middle of}} equivalent aspect ratio. The aperture plate is placed just behind the gate, and <b>masks</b> <b>off</b> any light from hitting the image outside of the area intended to be shown. All films, even those in the standard Academy ratio, have extra image on the frame that is meant <b>to</b> be <b>masked</b> <b>off</b> in the projection.|$|R
2500|$|A {{symbolic}} language {{and way of}} communicating emerges, in which inanimate [...] "things" [...] are personified. A market (or a price, or a stock, or a state etc.) gains an independent power to act. Marx calls this commodity fetishism (or more generally, [...] "fetishism"), and he regards it as a necessary reification of the symbolizations required to traverse life's situations in bourgeois society, because the relationships between people are constantly being mediated by the relationships between things. It means that people are eventually unable <b>to</b> take their <b>mask</b> <b>off,</b> because the <b>masks</b> are controlled by the business relationships between things being traded, and by broader legal, class, or political interests. If they are actually unable <b>to</b> take the <b>mask</b> <b>off,</b> they have effectively submitted fully {{to the power of}} abstract, impersonal market forces and legal rules. As many philosophical texts suggest, by being habituated to a role, the role is internalized by individuals, and becomes part of their personality: they become the thing that they acted out.|$|R

5000|$|The ENMAX Centrium is a two-tier 7,111-seat {{multi-purpose}} {{arena in}} Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. It {{was built in}} 1991 and is the home arena of the Red Deer Rebels hockey team. The arena can hold a maximum of 7,819 people when floor seating is used. [...] "Half house" [...] seating is 3,357 when floor to ceiling divider curtains are used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> unused seating.|$|E
50|$|In Watercolouring, frisket, also {{sometimes}} called masking fluid, is a removable liquid masking fluid based on latex and ammonia, often available in various colours {{to make its}} presence more obvious, which {{is applied to the}} surface in order <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> the areas that are not to be coloured by a given application of paint. Frisket is usually used when the unmasked areas are desired to be the same colour and a rapid wash is being applied, or for negative painting effects.|$|E
50|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the camera}} were produced, each of which was available with a quartz date imprint back. The basic model was the EOS 50. The EOS 50E variant introduced an enhanced version of the 3-zone eye-controlled autofocus system that was first seen on the EOS 5 camera. The Japan-only EOS 55 was available in an all-black version - rather than the standard black and silver colour scheme - and included a panorama option. Sliding the button {{at the bottom of}} the rear of the camera causes panels <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> all of the negative except for a 13 mm x 36mm strip in the middle.|$|E

50|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable <b>to</b> pull the <b>mask</b> <b>off.</b> R. L. Stine says he {{got the idea for}} the book from his son who wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|R
50|$|Next, Rey Mysterio {{wrestled}} Kane {{with the}} stipulation that if Mysterio lost {{he would have}} to unmask. During the start of the match Mysterio went for a running attack only to be big booted by Kane. Kane tried <b>to</b> rip Mysterio's <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> only for Mysterio to roll out of the ring. A spot in the match was Mysterio going for a diving hurracanrana only to be caught by Kane who went for a powerbomb, only to be headscissored over the top rope. The end of the match was Mysterio looking to dive to the outside onto Kane, but Kane attacking him with a chair shot in mid-air caused a disqualification.|$|R
5000|$|... "Low-complexity region" [...] means {{a region}} of a {{sequence}} composed of few kinds of elements. These regions might give high scores that confuse the program to find the actual significant sequences in the database, so they should be filtered out. The regions will be marked with an X (protein sequences) or N (nucleic acid sequences) and then be ignored by the BLAST program. To filter out the low-complexity regions, the SEG program is used for protein sequences and the program DUST is used for DNA sequences. On the other hand, the program XNU is used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> the tandem repeats in protein sequences.|$|E
50|$|Masking tape, {{also known}} as sticky tape, {{is a type of}} {{pressure-sensitive}} tape made of a thin and easy-to-tear paper, and an easily released pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is available in a variety of widths. It is used mainly in painting, <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> areas that should not be painted. The adhesive is the key element to its usefulness, as it allows the tape to be easily removed without leaving residue or damaging the surface to which it is applied. The tape is available in several strengths, rated on a 1-100 scale based on the strength of the adhesive. Most painting operations will require a tape in the 50 range. Household masking tape is made of an even weaker paper and lower-grade adhesive.|$|E
50|$|When {{constructed}} with plastic films instead of paper, masking tapes {{can be used}} for more rigorous applications. Polyester-based tapes are used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> during etching, plating, and in particular, powder coating. Tapes based on polyimide films can resist molten solder in electronics applications. Glass cloth tapes are often used in powder coating and sandblasting operations. Foil or vinyl tapes are often used in plating. Layered tapes made from multiple materials laminated together {{can be used for}} masking flame spray, thermal spray and HVOF. Masking tape {{can also be used to}} adhere posters to walls up to the day rating. Masking tape can basically be used for any purpose required of it, and is not limited solely to painting needs.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1999 {{animated}} film, Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein is {{the main}} antagonist voiced by Michael Bell. After secretly creating the monster in a roller coaster, his lab is discovered by the Chipmunks and sends his creation after them. After the creature had not returned, {{he goes to the}} Chipmunks' house and kidnaps Alvin. He then uses a formula that makes Alvin go out of control. After Alvin is returned to normal, Frankenstein in the disguise of the park's mascot Sammy the Squirrel tries to electrocute him, but is electrocuted by his own creation. When he regains conscious, he is unable <b>to</b> get the <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> him. Later {{near the end of the}} film, he appears as the theme park's entertainer.|$|R
25|$|Masks {{are also}} {{familiar}} as pieces of kit associated with practical functions, usually protective. There {{has been a}} proliferation of such masks recently {{but there is a}} long history of protective armour and even medical <b>masks</b> <b>to</b> ward <b>off</b> plague. The contrast with performance masks is not always clear-cut. Ritual and theatrical masks themselves can be considered to be practical, and protective masks in a sports context in particular are often designed to enhance the appearance of the wearer.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{off-road}} helmets did {{not include}} a chin bar, with riders using helmets very similar to modern open face street helmets, and using a face <b>mask</b> <b>to</b> fend <b>off</b> dirt and debris from the nose and mouth. Modern off-road helmets include a (typically angular, rather than round) chin bar to provide some facial impact protection in addition to protection from flying dirt and debris. When properly combined with goggles, the result provides most of the same protective features of full face street helmets.|$|R
5000|$|Masked (or flat) {{widescreen}} {{was introduced}} in April 1953. The negative is shot exposing the Academy ratio using spherical lenses, but {{the top and bottom}} of the picture are hidden or masked off by a metal aperture plate, cut to specifications of the theater's screen, in the projector. Alternatively, a hard matte in the printing or shooting stages may be used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> those areas while filming for composition purposes, but an aperture plate is still used to block off the appropriate areas in the theater. A detriment is that the film grain size is thus increased because only part of the image is being expanded to full height. Films are designed to be shown in cinemas in masked widescreen format but the full unmasked frame is sometimes used for television. In such an instance, a photographer will compose for widescreen, but [...] "protect" [...] the full image from things such as microphones and other filming equipment. Standardized [...] "flat wide screen" [...] ratios are 1.66:1, 1.75:1, 1.85:1, and 2:1. 1.85:1 has become the predominant aspect ratio for the format.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem is}} {{considered}} of generating approximate quantum-mechanical wavefunctions that {{have as many}} as possible coefficients held exactly to zero for a given desired accuracy. Two approaches are adopted. In the first, perturbation theory within the Davidson diagonalisation algorithm is used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> small coefficients in the wavefunction against a predefined target energy threshold. Second, sparsity is introduced by penalty-function optimisation, with a norm-based compressive-sampling penalty function that decreases with increasing sparsity. The first approach is found to be robust and reliable, whereas the second does not succeed in keeping the wavefunction sparse...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{a forward}} {{recovery}} strategy using checkpointing and optimistic execution in parallel and distributed systems. The approach uses replicated tasks executing on different processors for forwared recovery and checkpoint comparison for error detection. To reduce overall redundancy, this approach employs a lower static redundancy {{in the common}} error-free situation to detect error than the standard N Module Redundancy scheme (NMR) does <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> errors. For the rare occurrence of an error, this approach uses some extra redundancy for recovery. To reduce the run-time recovery overhead, look-ahead processes are used to advance computation speculatively and a rollback process is used to produce a diagnosis for correct look-ahead processes without rollback of the whole system. Both analytical and experimental evaluation have shown that this strategy can provide a nearly error-free execution time even under faults with a lower average redundancy than NMR...|$|E
50|$|The Phantom of the Opera (1925): Featuring Lon Chaney, Sr., Norman Kerry and Mary Philbin. For {{this classic}} silent film Universal Studios created a {{faithful}} {{replica of the}} Paris Opera House as a setting. The film was reissued in 1929 with sound effects, music and some reshot dialogue sequences (but none with Chaney). The scene in which Erik plays the organ and Christine creeps up behind him <b>to</b> snatch his <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> is often cited by critics and connoisseurs of film art {{as one of the}} most memorable moments in the history of film. The make up of Lon Chaney was so surprisingly disfiguring that the camera operator actually lost focus while shooting the sequence. Indeed, theaters were urged to have smelling salts on hand in case ladies in the audience fainted in horror.|$|R
2500|$|Following this match, Nagasaki and Rocco would {{continue}} to team until a year later at another televised Croydon tag match, where the team collapsed in spectacular fashion while facing Myers and Dave Taylor.

50|$|In the 1994 live-action {{film version}} of Street Fighter, Vega was played by Native American actor Jay Tavare. He is {{depicted}} {{as a member of}} the Shadaloo Tong working for Sagat. Along with his trademark mask and claw, he has very few lines during the whole film and utters them while his face is obscured or when he is off-camera. He forms a rivalry with Ryu, and in the film's final battle, he is defeated by Ryu and abandoned by Sagat to presumably die when Bison's base explodes. He also appears in the arcade game based on the film titled Street Fighter: The Movie, as well as in the home video game also based on the film. In the arcade version of the game, Vega has the ability <b>to</b> take his <b>mask</b> <b>off</b> and throw it to his opponent.
