Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use.

5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough's insatiable {{ambition}} {{made him}} the richest of all Anne's subjects. His family connections wove him {{into the fabric of}} European politics (his sister Arabella became James II's mistress, and their son, the Duke of Berwick, emerged as one of LouisXIV's greatest Marshals). His leadership of the allied armies consolidated Britain's emergence as a front-rank power. He successfully maintained unity among the allies, thereby demonstrating his diplomatic skills. Throughout ten consecutive campaigns during the Spanish Succession war, Marlborough held together a discordant coalition through his sheer force of personality and raised the standing of British arms <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> not known since the Middle Ages. Although in the end he could not compel total capitulation from his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise from a minor to a major power, ensuring the country's growing prosperity throughout the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600.

This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E

50|$|Inadequate {{provision}} {{was made for}} secondary modern students who performed well in GCE O Levels to articulate their studies <b>to</b> <b>A</b> <b>Levels.</b> During the 1950s and early 1960s, grammar schools would commonly not accept entry by secondary modern students who had done well in O Levels and who wished <b>to</b> study for <b>A</b> <b>Levels.</b> Such students {{had to leave the}} school system and enrol at post-secondary institutions (generally for part-time, evening study). Accordingly, once a student had been streamed into a secondary modern school, irrespective of the student's level of success in GCE O Levels, the student faced enormous challenges in attempting to progress <b>to</b> GCE <b>A</b> <b>Levels</b> and beyond <b>to</b> university. There is limited information available as to why the Tripartite System showed inflexibility in this respect. There is also limited information as to how many secondary modern students, who performed well in GCE O Levels, were subsequently frustrated in attempting <b>to</b> progress <b>to</b> <b>A</b> <b>Levels</b> and beyond.|$|R
