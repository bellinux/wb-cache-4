500|$|Early {{operations}} were problematic; {{in addition to}} supply problems, technical issues also struck. Ramps and taxiways deteriorated under the aircraft's weight, the fuel system was prone to leaks and icing, and bombing and fire control computers were unreliable. The split level cockpit presented a temperature control problem— the pilots' cockpit was heated by sunlight while the observer and the navigator on the bottom deck sat on the ice-cold floor. Thus, a comfortable <b>temperature</b> <b>setting</b> for the pilots caused the other crew members to freeze, while a comfortable temperature for the bottom crew caused the pilots to overheat. The J57 engines proved unreliable. Alternator failure caused the first fatal B-52 crash in February 1956; as a result, the fleet was briefly grounded. In July, fuel and hydraulic issues grounded the B-52s again. In response to maintenance issues, the air force set up [...] "Sky Speed" [...] teams of 50 contractors at each B-52 base to perform maintenance and routine checkups, taking an average of one week per aircraft.|$|E

40|$|A {{building}} management system (BMS) established to control the system of building services would not incorporate records of occupants' views nor integrate real-time occupants' response for any system fine tuning to satisfy individual demands in a dynamic manner. This study proposes a humanized adaptive baseline information technology (HABIT) algorithm to enable such fine tuning according to the occupants' feedback to optimize {{the acceptance of the}} indoor environment. Apart from solving the complaints from occupants, the proposed algorithm also integrates the collective real-time feedback from endusers with a balance of the imposed design conditions to determine the optimum operation condition of the system. In the study, the <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> point of an air-conditioning system in certain Hong Kong offices was used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the operation of the algorithm. Survey results on occupants' views and indoor environmental conditions of the offices were used to determine the input parameters of the algorithm.

Practical application: This study provides a new notion of humanized adaptive baseline information technology (HABIT) for air-conditioned spaces of a single <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> point.

50|$|First, {{the desired}} {{temperature}} is programmed into the electronic control panel. A motor-driven auger then feeds {{a small amount}} of pellets from the hopper to the fire pot. Igniter rods light the pellets and prime the fire, raising the grill to an initial starting temperature (140 °F to 180 °F, depending on manufacturer). Once the fire is ready, the desired temperature is achieved via a repeated duty cycle, which represents a segment of time when the auger is active and idle. A single duty cycle starts when the auger turns on and begins feeding pellets then continues through the period when it shuts off and remains idle. The duty cycle ends when the auger turns on again. For example, a pellet grill set to 250 °F might have an auger-on period of 10 seconds followed by an auger-off period of 50 seconds. Duty cycles are typically stated as a percentage that represents the amount of time the auger is running—an auger that's always on has a 100% duty cycle, while one that is on half the time has a 50% duty cycle. Each <b>temperature</b> <b>setting</b> has a different duty cycle. However, regardless of that <b>temperature</b> <b>setting,</b> the auger-on portion of the duty cycle remains constant. The auger-off period is the variable. Lower temperatures have longer auger-off periods, while high temperatures have shorter.|$|E

The combination of solar water heating and back-up heat from a wood stove chimney can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates, without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar water heating system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.|$|E
50|$|On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor {{water use}} in 1999, at 6 - 8 gal per minute {{traditionally}} in America. A simple method to reduce this use is {{to switch to}} low-flow, high-performance showerheads. These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature. Solar water heaters {{can be used to}} obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers. One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary. This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired <b>temperature</b> <b>setting</b> (common in the UK but not the United States).|$|E

Conventionally, a <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> is chosen {{in such a way that}} the acceptance rates for replica swaps between adjacent temperatures are independent of the temperature and large enough to ensure frequent swaps. In this paper, we show that by choosing the temperatures with a modified version of the optimized ensemble feedback method we can minimize the round-trip times between the lowest and highest temperatures which effectively increases {{the efficiency of}} the parallel tempering algorithm. In particular, the density of temperatures in the optimized <b>temperature</b> <b>set</b> increases at the 'bottlenecks' of the simulation, such as phase transitions. In turn, the acceptance rates are now temperature dependent in the optimized temperature ensemble.
