2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. I think it will be admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, <b>turned-on,</b> keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as a second thought. He has been temporarily amused; what is there to complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), so everybody in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E

On three different occasions, Lieutenant Aitken went into the garden under the enemy's loopholes in the [...] "Captain's Bazaar". On two of these occasions, he brought out a number of bullocks which had been left in the garden;— subsequently, on the 3rd of July, the enemy having set fire to the Bhoosa Stock in the garden, and it being apprehended that the fire would reach the Powder Magazine which had been left there, Lieutenant Aitken, accompanied by other Officers, went into the garden, and cut down all the tents which might have communicated the fire to the powder. This was done, close to the enemy's, loopholes. Under a bright light from the flames. It was almost dangerous service.2. On the night of the 20 August, the Enemy, having set fire to the Baillie Guard Gate, Lieutenant Aitken was the first man in the gateway, and, assisted by some sepoys and a water-carrier of his Regiment, he partially opened the gate under a-heavy, fire of musketry, and, having removed the burning wood and straw, saved the gate.3. On the evening of the 25 September, this Officer led on twelve sepoys of his Regiment, for the purpose of attacking two guns opposite the gate referred to, in order to prevent their being <b>turned-on</b> the late Major-General Havelock's second column. Having captured them, he attacked and took the Teree Kotee, with a small force.4.

On this occasion, he sprang up against a small wicket gate on the right and prevented the enemy from shutting it, until, with assistance, it was forced open, and the assaulting party were thus enabled to rush in. The complete success of the attack was solely owing to this Officer's distinguished bravery.5. In a subsequent sortie on 29 September, Lieutenant Aitken volunteered to take a gun which still continued firing, taking with him four soldiers through the houses and lanes to the gun. The enemy fired on this party from the houses, but they held their ground, until a stronger party coming up, the gun was upset from its carriage, and taken into the Residency.

40|$|Fringe-projection profilometry with 1 {{camera and}} 1 fringe-projector is a {{well-known}} and widely used technique in optical metrology. Spatial-frequency multiplexing interferometry with several spatial-carriers having non-overlapping spatial-spectra is also well known and productive in optical metrology. In this paper we propose temporal-multiplexing phase-shifting interferometry applied to profilometry. That is, instead of having fringe-patterns with well separated spatial-spectra, we propose instead to separate the fringe information in the temporal-spectra. In other words, we may have overlapping spatial-spectra, but separated in the temporal-spectra by frequency multiplexing. Using 1 -camera and several fringe-projectors one minimizes the object shadows and specular reflections from the digitizing solid. Temporal multiplexing profilometry allows us to illuminate the object from several projectors <b>turned-on</b> simultaneously. In previous phase-shifting co-phased profilometry, the projectors were <b>turned-on</b> and off sequentially. As seen in this work temporal-multiplexing allow us to demodulate the several fringe-patterns without crosstalk from other simultaneously projected fringes. This is entirely analogous to having several television stations broadcasting simultaneously, each TV-transmitter having its own broadcasting frequency. A given TV-receiver tunes into a single TV-station and filter-out all other broadcasters. Following this analogy, each fringe-projector must have its own temporal broadcasting frequency to remain well separated from all other projectors in the time-spectra domain. In addition to the general theory presented, we assess its feasibility with experimental results. Comment: 14 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
