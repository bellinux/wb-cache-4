5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were infected by <b>trachoma.</b> There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure <b>trachoma</b> boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of myrobalan to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|The school {{initially}} housed 250 Navajo and Hopi children, {{and additional}} buildings were constructed to accommodate them. Between 1933 and 1939, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) used {{the site for}} its regional <b>trachoma</b> school, using both laboratory animals and Indian children for experiments to treat the eye disease. During World War II, the school taught students from {{a good number of}} southwestern tribes. During the 1950s, as the tribe was fighting against termination, the emphasis of the school was on vocational and technical training. Beginning in 1960, the BIA contracted for schools to be built near other tribes, and attendance at the school started to drop.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1973, it {{used oil}} {{money to fund}} social welfare programs, which led to house-building {{projects}} and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya's growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50% more hospitals than it had in 1968, {{while the number of}} doctors had grown from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and <b>trachoma</b> and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.|$|E
25|$|Facilities {{improved}} during Soviet times. Education {{and public}} health especially began to see some major changes. In 1913, Nakhchivan only had two hospitals {{with a total of}} 20 beds. The region was plagued by widespread diseases including <b>trachoma</b> and typhus. Malaria, which mostly came from the adjoining Aras River, brought serious harm to the region. At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhchivan's population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and <b>trachoma,</b> typhus, and relapsing fever were completely eliminated.|$|E
25|$|From {{the records}} of St. Francis' {{physical}} ailments and symptoms, Dr. Edward Frederick Hartung concluded in 1935 that he knew what health problems plagued St. Francis. Hartung believed {{that he had an}} eye ailment known as <b>trachoma</b> and quartan malaria.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} {{treatment}} of choice for infections caused by chlamydia (<b>trachoma,</b> psittacosis, salpingitis, urethritis and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, they {{may be used to}} treat anthrax, plague, tularemia and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} {{public health}} impacts of open defecation {{are the same}} as those described when there is no access to sanitation at all. Open defecation—and lack of sanitation and hygiene in general—is an important factor that cause various diseases; the most common being diarrhea and intestinal worm infections but also typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, polio, <b>trachoma,</b> and others.|$|E
25|$|Yet at {{the same}} time, he still managed to conduct {{research}} into other areas. From 1922 to 1925, Kligler published epidemiological studies on various infectious diseases including <b>Trachoma,</b> jointly with the renowned ophthalmologist Avraham Albert Ticho, Helminthic incidence in Jerusalem and Oriental Sore (leishmaniasis). He also conducted basic research on the characterization of Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasites grown on media.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in Ghana include those endemic to sub-Saharan African countries, particularly: cholera, typhoid, pulmonary tuberculosis, anthrax, pertussis, tetanus, chicken pox, yellow fever, measles, infectious hepatitis, <b>trachoma,</b> malaria, HIV and schistosomiasis. Though not as common, other regularly treated diseases include dracunculiasis, dysentery, river blindness or onchocerciasis, several kinds of pneumonia, dehydration, venereal diseases, and poliomyelitis.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{endorsing}} the biggest ever collaborative disease eradication programme called the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases launched on 30 January 2012 in London, {{the organization has}} implemented SightFirst program by which it aims to eradicate blindness due to <b>trachoma,</b> one of the neglected tropical diseases. It has allocated over US$11 million in 10 countries for eye surgeries, medical training, distribution of Zithromax and tetracycline, and sanitary services. It has also announced US$6.9 million funding to support the Government of China for the same cause.|$|E
25|$|High {{population}} densities, poor living conditions, low vaccination rates, insufficient {{health-related data}} and inadequate health service engender {{a higher rate}} of disease transmission in slums than that in non-slum areas. Overcrowding leads to faster and wider spread of diseases due to the limited space in slum housing. Poor living conditions also make slum dwellers more vulnerable to certain diseases. Poor water quality, a manifest example, is a cause of many major illnesses including malaria, diarrhea and <b>trachoma.</b> As Sur et al. suggest, improving living conditions such as introduction of better sanitation and access to basic facilities can ameliorate the effects of diseases.|$|E
25|$|In April 1905, the San Juan {{was caught}} in a storm, which nearly capsized her. The storm damaged all her machinery, {{including}} her engine. Due to this, the San Juan, now 24 years old, arrived late to San Francisco, California. At this point in her career, San Juan was known for being unreliably slow. In June 1905, the San Juan carried 58 Russian immigrants from Panama to California, where they joined a Slavic community in Los Angeles, California. The immigrants came from Batum. One Russian girl on the San Juan was supposedly suffering from <b>trachoma,</b> which threatened to have her deported when the steamer reached its American dock.|$|E
25|$|Hadassah {{established}} the American Zionist Medical Unit (AZMU) in 1918, which {{was composed of}} 45 doctors, nurses, dentists and sanitary engineers. The Unit {{was set up to}} combat the intolerable health conditions of postwar Palestine and to create permanent health and welfare programs. From the beginning, it established a principle that it would serve all with equal care, regardless of race, creed, ethnicity or nationality. The AZMU helped to establish six hospitals in Palestine which were then turned over to municipal authorities. Led by Alice Seligsberg, the Unit sailed for Palestine in June, bringing desperately needed drugs, medical instruments and supplies, linen and clothing. That year, Hadassah also founded a nursing school to train local personnel and create a cadre of nurses. Over the next few years, the Unit, based in the old Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem, initiated American-style health and welfare programs with intensive campaigns to wipe out malaria, cholera, <b>trachoma</b> and scalp diseases in many Jewish communities in the yishuv. The Unit organized a sanitation program and founded Hadassah hospitals in Jaffa, Tiberias, and Safed, as well as opened the Nurses Training School at the Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem. The first 22 young women graduated from Hadassah's Nurses' Training School in 1921. In 1924, the Unit's name is changed to Hadassah Medical Organization.|$|E

2500|$|Surgery was {{important}} in treating patients with eye complications, such as <b>trachoma</b> and cataracts. [...] A common complication of <b>trachoma</b> patients is the vascularization of the tissue that invades the cornea of the eye, which {{was thought to be}} the cause of the disease, by ancient Islamic physicians. The technique used to correct this complication was done surgically and known today as peritomy. This procedure was done by [...] "employing an instrument for keeping the eye open during surgery, a number of very small hooks for lifting, and a very thin scalpel for excision." [...] A similar technique in treating complications of <b>trachoma,</b> called pterygium, was used to remove the triangular-shaped part of the bulbar conjunctiva onto the cornea. This was done by lifting the growth with small hooks and then cut with a small lancet. Both of these surgical techniques were extremely painful for the patient and intricate for the physician or his assistants to perform.|$|E
2500|$|While Noguchi was {{influential}} {{during his}} lifetime, later research {{was not able}} to reproduce many of his claims, including having discovered the causes of polio, rabies, syphilis, <b>trachoma,</b> and yellow fever. [...] His finding that Noguchia granulosis causes <b>trachoma</b> was questioned within a year of his death, and overturned shortly thereafter. His identification of the rabies pathogen was wrong, [...] because the medium he invented to cultivate bacteria was seriously prone to contamination. A fellow Rockefeller Institute researcher said that Noguchi [...] "knew nothing about the pathology of yellow fever" [...] and criticized him for being unwilling to issue retractions for false claims, saying, [...] "I don't think that Noguchi was an honest scientist". Noguchi's failures have often been attributed to his tendency to work in isolation without the skeptical eye of fellow researchers. What are considered flaws in the Rockefeller Institute's system of peer review is also a frequent subject of criticism.|$|E
2500|$|The life {{expectancy}} of the Northern Territory's Aboriginal citizens did not increase markedly during Martin's administration. [...] Alcohol abuse {{continued to be a}} major issue in Aboriginal communities and third-world diseases like <b>trachoma</b> could be seen in remote Aboriginal townships. However, in 2006, Martin rejected accusations by John Howard and Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, Mal Brough, that her government had been underfunding Aboriginal communities. A summit between the federal and territory governments was proposed by Mal Brough in May 2006, but this was snubbed by Martin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, Hadassah {{sent two}} nurses to Palestine, Rose Kaplan and Rae Landy. They {{set up a}} small public health station in Jerusalem to provide {{maternity}} care and treat <b>trachoma,</b> a dreaded eye disease rampant in the Middle East. The core of future Hadassah education programs emerged when Jessie Sampter founded The Hadassah School of Zionism in New York in 1915. The school required chapter leaders to take courses, instituted a correspondence course and inspires other Hadassah chapters {{to create their own}} Schools of Zionism. Sampter published [...] "A Course in Zionism," [...] a collection of facts, essays, and reading lists financed by prominent American Zionist, Judge Louis Brandeis.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1943, Deutsch, {{her mother}} and her brother were {{deported}} to Auschwitz by the Nazis. Out of 75 prisoners during the six-day journey in the cattle wagon, without food and water, 25 did not survive. Lea Deutsch was among them, her heart having been weakened by diphtheria in her childhood. Her mother and brother were killed in Auschwitz. Her [...] father, Stjepan, managed to save himself, hiding as a patient who suffered from infectious ocular <b>trachoma</b> at the ward of an ophthalmologist, Dr Vilko Panac, in the Sisters of Charity Hospital, Zagreb. Stjepan Deutsch survived the Holocaust and lived until 1959. He was buried in the Jewish part of the Mirogoj Cemetery, with Lea's photo on his tombstone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, Noguchi {{traveled}} {{extensively in}} Central America and South America {{working with the}} International Health Board to conduct research to develop a vaccine for yellow fever, and to research Oroya fever, poliomyelitis and <b>trachoma.</b> He believed that yellow fever was caused by spirochaete bacteria instead of a virus. He worked {{for much of the}} next ten years trying to prove this theory. His work on yellow fever was widely criticized as taking an inaccurate approach that was contradictory to contemporary research, and confusing yellow fever with other pathogens. In 1927-28 three different papers appeared in medical journals that discredited his theories. It turned out he had confused yellow fever with leptospirosis. The vaccine he developed against [...] "yellow fever" [...] was successfully used to treat the latter disease.|$|E
2500|$|While he {{was praying}} on the {{mountain}} of Verna, during a forty-day fast in preparation for Michaelmas (September 29), Francis {{is said to have}} had a vision on or about September 14, 1224, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, as a result of which he received the stigmata. Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. [...] "Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ." [...] Suffering from these stigmata and from <b>trachoma,</b> Francis received care in several cities (Siena, Cortona, Nocera) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where it all began, feeling the end approaching, he spent the last days of his life dictating his spiritual Testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), [...] "Voce mea ad Dominum".|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{touring the}} Mediterranean with Lina in 1904, the couple stopped over in Palestine, expecting {{it to be}} but one stop of many. He wrote, [...] "On {{reaching}} Jerusalem, we changed our plans. All {{that we saw in}} the Holy Land made such a deep impression on us that we gave up the idea of going to other places. Visiting the holy sights of which one hears and reads since childhood, watching the scenes in life as pictured in the Bible, was most soul-stirring. From that time on we felt a strange and intense desire to return to the land." [...] Nathan and Lina became staunch Zionists. He built soup kitchens for the aged and the blind and the physically defective in 1917. He supported workrooms so that unskilled laborers could find employment. He built health stations which ministered to the victims of malaria and <b>trachoma.</b> He believed strongly in palliative care. He provided $250,000 for the establishment of the Jerusalem Health Center and made possible the founding of a Pasteur Institute. He lent moral and material support to the farmers and colonists of Israel and labored {{in the interests of the}} Hebrew University.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the transatlantic}} liners dumped out at Ellis Island {{a lump of}} {{protozoa}} which was expected to evolve into an American citizen. A steward kicked him down the gangway, a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven, seeking for <b>trachoma</b> or ophthalmia; he was hustled ashore and ejected into {{the city in the}} name of Liberty--perhaps, theoretically, thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus. This hypodermic injection of Europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child. It was not burdened with baggage, cares or ambitions. Its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian; its face was brightly vacant, with a small, flat nose, and was mostly covered by a thick, ragged, curling beard like the coat of a spaniel. In the pocket of the imported Thing were a few coins--denarii--scudi--kopecks--pfennigs--pilasters--whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country may have been.|$|E

If an individual is already infected washing one’s face is strongly encouraged, especially a child, in order to prevent re-infection. Some evidence exists that washing the face combined with topical tetracycline might be more effective in reducing severe <b>trachoma</b> compared to topical tetracycline alone.
