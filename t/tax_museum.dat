40|$|The {{development}} of Hong Kong’s British influenced Revenue Regime is remarkable. The early configuration {{of that system}} was a direct product of what is {{sometimes referred to as}} the first era of globalization, which was a profoundly energized by European colonization and empire building. The aggressive, ultimately violent, Japanese response to that European example drove further changes in the Hong Kong Tax System. Yet, the system which emerged in Hong Kong after World War II looked a lot like a recreation from a 19 th century <b>Tax</b> <b>Museum.</b> This, more by accident than design, proved especially well suited to fostering Hong Kong’s dramatically successful integration into the post-war, world trading system as the modern era of globalization began. Today, Hong Kong’s Tax System is adapting further to newer regional and global trading relationships. postprin...|$|E

50|$|The Museum {{dismantled}} the Covered Bridge in 1949 {{and moved}} it to the Museum grounds. The beams still bear the identifying numbers for reconstruction. By situating it above a man-made pond, extensive landscaping integrated the bridge into the grounds. The Covered Bridge served for many years as the Museum’s entrance, but when automobile traffic proved too <b>taxing,</b> the <b>Museum</b> relocated the entrance and retired the bridge from duty.|$|R
25|$|MoMA employs about 815 people. The <b>museum's</b> <b>tax</b> filings {{from the}} past few years suggest a shift among the highest paid {{employees}} from curatorial staff to management. The museum's director Glenn D. Lowry earned $1.6 million in 2009 and lives in a rent-free $6 million apartment above the museum.|$|R

50|$|There was a {{four-year}} legal fight concerning unpaid property taxes that Orange County Property Appraiser Bill Donegan alleged were owed. Donegan {{argued that the}} Holy Land Experience is a theme park. Donegan dropped his fight after state lawmakers passed a law in 2006 granting a tax exemption for theme parks that display, exhibit, illustrate and interpret biblical manuscripts. This {{is similar to the}} <b>tax</b> exemption for <b>museums</b> that present historical information on other subjects. The law prevented Orange County from collecting the alleged back taxes as well as forgiving the park $300,000 in yearly property taxes. The law requires the park to offer an annual free admissions day.|$|R
50|$|The set of Sacraments is {{no longer}} complete: one, Penance, was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1816, Baptism was sold around 1939 {{and is now in}} the National Gallery of Art, Washington and Ordination was sold in 2011 to the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas. As a result of this last sale, and consequent Inheritance <b>Tax,</b> the Fitzwilliam <b>Museum</b> was offered through H.M.

25|$|To date, the Government of Canada has {{allocated}} $100 million, the Government of Manitoba {{has donated}} $40 million, and the City of Winnipeg has donated $20 million. The Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, led by Gail Asper, have {{raised more than}} $130 million in private donations from across Canada toward a final goal of $150 million. These private sector pledges include $4.5 million from provincial crown corporations in Manitoba and $5 million from the government of Ontario. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights has requested an additional $35 million in capital funding {{from the federal government}} to cover shortfalls. In April 2011, the CMHR received an additional $3.6 million from the City of Winnipeg, which was actually taken from a federal grant to the city in lieu of <b>taxes</b> for the <b>museum.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{the close}} of the Exposition, the {{structure}} that had housed the art show of the fair, was presented to the city of Saint Louis as the permanent home of the art collection Ives ran. Ives introduced a bill into the General Assembly for an art tax to support the maintenance of the museum. The bill was approved by the citizens of Saint Louis by a nearly 4-to-1 margin. However, the city's controller refused to distribute the <b>tax</b> to the <b>museum's</b> board of control, as it was not a municipal entity and so had no right to funds from taxes. The controller's position was upheld in 1908 by the Missouri Supreme Court. This caused the formal separation of the museum from the university in 1909. As a result, the museum became a public entity. The University agreed to lend its collection and Halsey Ives to continue to direct it. The institution was renamed the City Art Museum. Art should be a matter of every-day enjoyment and use to every normally-constituted man, woman, and child. Halsey Cooley Ives ...|$|R
