5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars,</b> believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars.</b> In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E

5000|$|I {{was getting}} my cheque, just not my actual royalties. I got a three <b>thousand</b> <b>dollar</b> {{guarantee}} a month, which operated as a minimum; meaning I get {{that no matter}} what, but if I sell over the minimum, I get the extras - royalties kick in ... So what had happened was, they were letting my royalties fall back into the company to cover their overhead, which helped keep a boat afloat that had some leaks. For two years I apparently didn't break my three <b>thousand</b> <b>dollar</b> minimum ... Don't forget, we're taking about Girl here who sells {{all around the world}} ... So I inappropriately blurted out at Tampa 2007, after getting second to Koston, who had a flawed run, against mine which was flawless, that all I wanted was my royalties, when Rick Howard asked what I wanted after doing so well.

5|$|Much of Gore's {{financial}} activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts, where his father-in-law was a director.

During his time on the board the bank tightened its regulations on loan repayments, a move that improved the stability of its capital. Gore used the bank {{for most of his}} personal deposits, but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars.</b> The bank shares he held paid relatively high dividends until 1791, when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating several hundred <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E
