5000|$|Condensation curing {{systems can}} be one-part or two-part systems. [...] In one-part or RTV (room-temperature vulcanizing) system, a {{cross-linker}} exposed to ambient humidity (i.e., water) experiences a hydrolysis step and is left with a hydroxyl or silanol group. The silanol condenses further with another hydrolyzable group on the polymer or cross-linker and continues until the system is fully cured. Such a system will cure on its own at room temperature and (unlike the platinum-based addition cure system) is not easily inhibited by contact with other chemicals, though the process may be affected by contact with some plastics or metals and may not take place at all if placed in contact with already-cured silicone compounds. The crosslinkers used in condensation cure systems are typically alkoxy, acetoxy or oxime silanes such as methyl trimethoxy silane for alkoxy-curing systems and methyl triacetoxysilane for acetoxy-curing systems. In many cases an additional condensation catalyst is added to fully cure the RTV system and achieve a <b>tack-free</b> surface. Organotitanate catalysts such as tetraalkoxy titanates or chelated titanates are used in alkoxy-cured systems. Tin catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) {{can be used in}} oxime and acetoxy-cured systems. Acetoxy tin condensation {{is one of the oldest}} cure chemistries used for curing silicone rubber, and is the one used in household bathroom caulk. The smell of vinegar in the form of acetic acid is the usual indicator that the curing reaction is taking place. Non-acid-producing formulations also exist which have a shorter shelf-life, however, and reduced adhesion when finally cured. [...] Two-part condensation systems package the cross-linker and condensation catalyst together in one part while the polymer and any fillers or pigments are in the second part. Mixing of the two parts causes the curing to take place.|$|E

Film formation is also aided by the tin carboxylates being able to form an intermolecularly associated structure. The tin acrylates can be used in conjunction with prepolymers, e. g. an epoxidized soya bean oil (Synocure 3111) and a urethane acrylate (Synocure 3134).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1993 A new polymer {{combining}} the processing advantages of epoxy resins with the superior thermal {{performance of the}} dicyanate resins was developed for use in bonding aramid honeycomb core composites. Dual-stage curing to meet the unique requirements of the honeycomb manufacturing process was achieved with a tricomponent mixture of epoxy and dicyanate monomers and a carboxylic acid anhydride hardener. In {{the first stage of}} curing the anhydride hardener advances the resin mixture to the appropriate tack condition. Heat-activated latent curing reactions complete the polymer crosslinking at a later manufacturing stage. The effect of variations in the levels of cyanate and anhydride on the bonding strength to the aramid paper and the time to reach <b>tack-free</b> conditions were studied. Characterization of the polymers chemical network development through kinetic investigations, thermal analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy was also undertaken. The reaction between cyanate ester groups and anhydride rings produced linear polyimidocarbamates that were identifiable by their FT-IR spectrum as one of the principal polymerization pathways. In the presence of an epoxy resin and tertiary amine catalysts, these imidocarbamates further reacted to form polyimides with possible organic carbonate branching. The resulting polymers showed good thermal stability with a single glass transition temperature that indicates the formation of an interconnecting polymer with significant crosslinking. Little if any polycyanurate was detected in the final product. Polymerization kinetics were studied using dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The imidocarbamate forming reaction was found to be of the same order as the competing epoxy/acid anhydride esterification reaction and significantly faster than the dicyanate/epoxy or dicyanate cyclotrimerization reactions. Autocatalytic kinetic behavior was observed for the imidocarbamate reaction. When all three components were reacted in a combined system, the extent of epoxy esterification appeared to be largely over predicted by the isolated DSC results. The overall reactive system appears to be more complex than can be modeled by a simple combination of the individual reactions...|$|E

The fatty acid analysis of the oil carried out earlier revealed oleic and linolenic as dominant fatty acids, having values of 72. 1 and 10. 3 % respectively. Four grades of alkyds were formulated at 40 % (I), 50 % (II), 60 % (III) and 70 % (IV) oil lengths. The reaction progression was followed by determining the acid value of the aliquots for the reaction mixture at various time intervals beside the volume of water evolved. Kinetic studies showed that the reaction was second-order with values of 3. 12 x 10 - 4, 2. 44 x 10 - 4, 2. 3 x 10 - 4 and 2. 28 x 10 - 4 g (mg KOH) - 1 min - 1 for samples I, II, III and IV respectively.

40|$|A wide {{interest}} is mounting {{in the field}} of polymer electrolytes, due to their application in energy efficient devices such as rechargeable batteries, photo-electrochemical cells, electrochromic devices, fuel cells and super capacitors. Polymer electrolytes exhibit unique advantages such as mechanical integrity, wide variety of fabrication methods in desirable size and shape, possibility to fabricate an intimate electrode/electrolyte interface and adapt to a lightweight, leak proof construction, safety and economic packaging structure. Free radical photo-polymerization (UV-curing) can be an interesting alternative process to produce polymer electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. It takes place at ambient temperature: a liquid polyfunctional monomer, containing a proper photo-initiator, forms a cross-linked film upon UV irradiation. It appears highly advantageous, due to its easiness and rapidity in processing, very short time with high efficiency and eco-friendliness as the use of solvent is avoided. In the present work, profoundly ion conducting, self-standing and <b>tack-free</b> ethylene oxide based polymer electrolytes encompassing a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) with specific amounts of lithium salt are successfully prepared via a rapid and easily up-scalable UV curing process. All the prepared materials are thoroughly characterized in terms of their physical, chemical and morphological properties, and eventually galvanostatically cycled in lab-scale lithium batteries (LIBs). The appearance of the cross-linked polymer electrolyte is interesting, where the remarkable mechanical abusability is demonstrated. The crosslinking produced by UV irradiation allows the incorporation of higher amount of RTIL (imidazolium, pyrrolidinium etc.) and/or tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tetraglyme) with lithium salt (based on TFSI- anion), leading to a material with remarkable morphological characteristics in terms of homogeneity and robustness. FESEM analysis was conducted to characterize the morphology of the photo cured polymer films. The typically wrinkled texture characteristics of highly amorphous, cross-linked polymer electrolytes is evidenced. The bright and dark areas in the image belong to amorphous PEO domains alternated to some residual ordered (semi crystalline) domains, respectively; the wrinkled texture derives from the formation of crosslinking domains between the polymer chains. Similar kind of textures are also present in polymer films kept at temperature under high stress (50 bar for 15 mins at 90 °C) during the preparation process. The UV-cured PEO-based polymer network is able to efficiently hold the RTIL without any leakage. Tensile analysis confirmed that the UV-irradiated membranes showed an average Young's modulus E of 0. 2 ± 0. 05 MPa. If one considers that more than 50 wt. % of ionic liquid is generally incorporated, these are highly satisfying values. The SPE showed the thermal stability up to 375 °C under inert conditions, and such a remarkable result is particularly interesting for application in Li-ion batteries with increased safety. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was used to get further information on the fundamental role of photo curing step in reducing the overall crystallinity of the SPE to nearly fully amorphous state. The SPE exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (> 10 - 4 Scm- 1 at room temperature), electrochemical stability (> 5 V vs. Li+/Li), and interfacial stability. At 20 °C the conductivity value is equal to 2. 5 × 10 - 4 Scm- 1. This result is encouraging as it is sufficiently high to allow ambient temperature operation of Li-ion cells. It exceeds 10 - 3 Scm- 1 already at 50 °C. The Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) behavior of the SPE was verified fitting the conductivity data with respect to temperature. The value of activation energy was found to be 8. 23 kJ mol- 1. The ability to resist the lithium dendrite nucleation and growth was tested by galvanostatic polarization studies. They showed resistance at current intensity > 0. 1 mAcm- 2. The lab-scale Li-polymer cell assembled showed stable charge/discharge characteristics without any capacity (135 mAh g- 1) fading at C/ 5 current regime (Figure 1 D).
