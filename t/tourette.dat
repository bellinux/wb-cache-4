5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} <b>Tourette</b> syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for <b>Tourette</b> syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with <b>Tourette</b> syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tourette</b> {{syndrome}} is found among all social, {{racial and ethnic}} groups and has been reported {{in all parts of the}} world; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females. The tics of <b>Tourette</b> syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity; thus, a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults, and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults. As children pass through adolescence, about one-quarter become tic-free, almost one-half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level, and less than one-quarter have persistent tics. Only 5 to 14% of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Marquette plays Miles Caraday, a young jazz piano prodigy with <b>Tourette</b> Syndrome. Marquette {{learned how}} to play the piano from Wolff.

40|$|Studies of <b>Tourette's</b> {{syndrome}} {{have indicated}} that the etiology may be either primary or secondary. Secondary <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome {{has been reported in}} association with numerous neurological conditions, but there have been no previous reports of <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome and its relationship to neonatal anoxia. This report presents the case of a 15 -year-old boy with a history of <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome and neonatal anoxia and examines {{whether or not there is}} a connection between the two. To test the hypothesis that this is the first documented case of cerebral anoxia at birth followed by <b>Tourette's,</b> a review of the pertinent literature on secondary <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome is presented. Evidence of perinatal anoxia, subsequent <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome, a negative family history, as well as an examination of the statistical chances of anoxia and <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome co-existing and of all previous reports of acquired <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome tend to favor an organic perinatal insult as having caused the later development of <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome in the case of this adolescent...|$|R

5|$|Conditions {{that must}} be {{considered}} in a differential diagnosis along with ADHD include other ASDs, the schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, semantic pragmatic disorder, nonverbal learning disorder, social anxiety disorder, <b>Tourette</b> syndrome, stereotypic movement disorder, bipolar disorder, social-cognitive deficits due to brain damage from alcohol abuse, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including <b>Tourette</b> syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.|$|E
5|$|Mental disorders, such {{as major}} {{depressive}} disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, <b>Tourette</b> syndrome, and addiction, are known {{to relate to the}} functioning of the brain. Treatment for mental disorders may include psychotherapy, psychiatry, social intervention and personal recovery work or cognitive behavioural therapy; the underlying issues and associated prognoses vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
40|$|Dysfunction of the dopaminergic pathway {{has been}} {{postulated}} to underlie the symptomatology of <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome. Presynaptic functional integrity of dopaminergic terminals was assessed with 18 F-dopa PET in 10 patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome, three {{of whom were}} drug free and seven of whom were on neuroleptic treatment. Dopamine D 2 receptor site density was measured with 11 C-raclopride PET in a further group of five drug free patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome. Mean caudate and putamen 18 F-dopa influx constants were similar in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome and controls, {{and there was no}} difference in striatal 18 F-dopa uptake between the treated and untreated <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome groups. Mean caudate and putamen 11 C-raclopride binding potentials in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome were also similar to control values. The findings suggest that striatal metabolism of exogenous levodopa and the density of striatal D 2 receptors are both normal in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome and that <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome does not arise from a primary dysfunction of dopaminergic terminals...|$|R

5|$|Some {{forms of}} OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette's.

5|$|<b>Tourette</b> {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with <b>Tourette</b> syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la <b>Tourette</b> (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E

5|$|Pre-dating Gilles de la Tourette's 1885 publication, likely {{portrayals of}} TS or tic {{disorders}} in fictional literature are Mr. Pancks in Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens and Nikolai Levin in Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. The entertainment {{industry has been}} criticized for depicting those with <b>Tourette</b> syndrome as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and in the British media.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tourette</b> {{syndrome}} (TS {{or simply}} Tourette's) {{is a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple motor tics {{and at least one}} vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles. Some common tics are eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. Tourette's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy.|$|E

5|$|Many of Wolff and Draper's show {{business}} friends {{appeared in the}} film. Wolff had been the music director for jazz singer Nancy Wilson and she introduced him to Arsenio Hall, who later chose Wolff as the bandleader of his talk show. Tony Shalhoub portrayed Phil in Draper's screenwriting debut The Tic Code, which was emboldened by Wolff's difficulties with <b>Tourette</b> syndrome {{as well as his}} exploits as a jazz pianist. Draper guest starred in the first season of Shalhoub's hit sitcom Monk. Other guest stars in the movie include Cyndi Lauper, David Thornton, Brent Popolizio, Cindy Blackman, and Ricki Lake.

40|$|<b>Tourette's</b> {{syndrome}} is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder {{characterized by the}} presence of both multiple motor and vocal tics. While the pathogenesis at a molecular and cellular level remains unknown, structural and functional neuroimaging studies point to the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits as the neuroanatomical site for <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome. Moreover, <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome has a strong genetic component, and considerable {{progress has been made in}} understanding the mode of transmission and in identifying potential genomic loci. Summaries of recent findings in these areas will be reviewed, followed by a critical overview of findings both supporting and challenging the proposed autoimmune hypothesis of <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome. We conclude that <b>Tourette's</b> {{syndrome is}} a heterogeneous disorder, and that immune factors may indeed be involved in some patients...|$|R
40|$|Changes in moods {{are one of}} the comorbid {{psychiatric}} manifestations {{that frequently}} occur in patients with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome. The assessment of a manic episode in children with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome is challenging. Furthermore, the treatment of children with comorbid mania and <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome has not been extensively studied. We present a 10 -year-old boy who suffered from both <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome and mania, whose symptoms improved after using lithium and risperidone. The child was diagnosed with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome at 7 years of age when he suffered from tics and experienced his first manic episode. He received monotherapy, including haloperidol, risperidone and aripiprazole, and the response was poor. When the combination of lithium and risperidone was used, the tics and mania subsided. It is important to assess individuals with <b>Tourette's</b> syndrome for associated bipolar disorder. The treatment of children with both disorders is a major clinical issue, and our case may serve as an example for successful treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} data {{have suggested that}} abnormalities in the serotonergic neurotransmissions in frontal-subcortical circuits are involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome. To test {{the hypothesis that the}} brain’s 5 -HT 2 A receptor binding is increased in patients with <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome, PET imaging was performed. Twenty adults with <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome and 20 healthy control subjects were investigated with PET-[18 F]altanserin using a bolus-infusion protocol. Regions of interest were delineated automatically on co-registered MRI images, and partial volume-corrected binding parameters were extracted from the PET images. Comparison between control subjects and <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome patients showed increased specific [18 F]altanserin binding, not only in the a-priori selected brain regions hypothesized to be involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome, but also post-hoc analysis showed a global up-regulation when testing for a overall difference with a randomization test (p< 0. 03). Increased 5 -HT 2 A receptor binding was found not only in regions closely related to subcortical regions in patients with <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome, but also in most other brain regions. Our data suggest that the serotonergic transmitter system is pathophysiologically involved in <b>Tourette’s</b> syndrome and that a clinical trial with 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists may be justified...|$|R
5|$|The Tic Code (also {{known as}} Lessons in the Tic Code) is a drama film {{directed}} by Gary Winick and written by Polly Draper. It {{tells of a}} single mother, the relationship she forms with a jazz musician who has <b>Tourette</b> syndrome, and her young son—a jazz piano prodigy—also with the disorder. The musician and the boy form a friendship, and the film is loosely based upon the experiences of Draper's jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who provided the film's score. Draper, known {{for her role in}} Thirtysomething, portrays the mother; Gregory Hines plays the musician; and Christopher George Marquette stars as the young boy.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, <b>Tourette</b> syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|The Tic Code was in {{development}} {{for five years}} before finally being made. Principal photography took place on location in New York City in 1997, on a budget of US$2 million. The film was directed by Gary Winick, who took over after original director Norman René died during pre-production. It was written by Polly Draper, who also produced alongside Karen Tangorra, Midge Sanford, Sarah Pillsbury and Larry Meistrich. Draper based the screenplay on the experiences of her noted jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, who has <b>Tourette</b> syndrome. Wolff's involvement as co-producer ensured the cooperation of jazz club The Village Vanguard, which granted the production permission to use its name and exterior shots of the building. Herman Leonard loaned his collection of photographs of famous jazz musicians, and the Blue Note jazz club allowed its name to be used on fake fliers. Wolff also provided the film's piano score, to which Alex Foster also contributed by providing the soundtrack for scenes of Hines' playing the saxophone.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} <b>Tourette's</b> is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.
