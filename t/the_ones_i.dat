500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it make you feel good to see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Webster {{found the}} casting of Darcy {{especially}} hard {{due to the}} character's iconic status and because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow" [...] as the 1995 Darcy. Wright later commented that his choice of Knightley allowed him to cast comparative unknown Matthew Macfadyen, something {{that would have been}} impossible had he chosen a less well-known actress for Elizabeth Bennet. Macfadyen at the time was known {{for his role in the}} British television spy series Spooks, but had no recognition internationally. A fan of the actor's television work, Wright called Macfadyen [...] "a proper manly man... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor. His properties were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> felt I needed [...] Matthew's a great big hunk of a guy." [...] Macfadyen did not read the novel before filming, preferring to rely solely on the script.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, former {{baseball}} players' union chief Marvin Miller, {{trying to}} defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against claims {{that he should not}} be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, [...] "Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as well. I think that by and large, the players, and certainly <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> knew, are good people. But the Hall is full of villains." [...] Miller's comment about Anson has no basis, other than speculating that he could have been a Klansman since he was a racist during his playing career, which ended in 1897, although he was umpiring games with black players by 1901, including featuring the all-black Columbia Giants. [...] Miller, age 91 at the time the 2008 article appeared, is the earliest source for declaring that it is factual that Anson {{was a member of the}} Klan, based purely on an Internet search of sources that try to link Anson to the Klan. [...] By contrast, Speaker-Cobb-Rogers Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring to the 1920s (Anson died in 1922), “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, it’s possible that they [...] were briefly in the Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. [...] The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided they were native born, Protestant and white.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On 17 April 1964 Springfield issued {{her debut}} album A Girl Called Dusty which {{included}} mostly remakes of her favourite songs. Among the tracks were [...] "Mama Said," [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes," [...] "You Don't Own Me," [...] and [...] "Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa." [...] The album reached No.6 in the UK in May 1964. The chart hits [...] "Stay Awhile," [...] "All Cried Out," [...] and [...] "Losing You" [...] {{followed the same}} year. The B-side of [...] "Stay Awhile" [...] featured another self-penned track, [...] "Somethin' Special," [...] which AllMusic's Richie Unterberger described as [...] "a first-rate Springfield original". However, Springfield declared: [...] "I don't really {{see myself as a}} songwriter. I don't really like writing... I just don't get any good ideas and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> do get are pinched from other records. The only reason I write is for the money – oh mercenary creature!" [...] In 1964, Springfield recorded two Burt Bacharach songs: [...] "Wishin' and Hopin'" [...] – a US Top10 hit – and the emotional [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself," [...] which reached No.3 on the UK chart. The latter song set the standard for much of her later material. In December 1964, Springfield's tour of South Africa with her group The Echoes was controversially terminated, and she was deported, after they performed for an integrated audience at a theatre near Cape Town, which was against the then government's segregation policy. Her contract specifically excluded segregated performances, making her one of the first British artists to do so. In the same year, she was voted the Top Female British Artist {{of the year in the}} New Musical Express poll, topping Lulu, Sandie Shaw, and Cilla Black. Springfield received the award again for the next three years. During 1965, Springfield released three more UK Top40 hits: [...] "Your Hurtin' Kinda Love," [...] "In the Middle of Nowhere," [...] and the Carole King-penned [...] "Some of Your Lovin'." [...] However, these were not included on her next UK album recorded with The Echoes, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, which was released in October 1965 and featured songs by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley, Rod Argent, and Randy Newman, and a cover of the traditional Mexican song, [...] "La Bamba." [...] The album peaked at No.6 on the UK chart.|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol {{was one of}} {{the acts}} at the iTunes Festival, which was held {{throughout}} July. The band played on 5 July, and was the co-headlining act for the day. The performance was released as a digital EP on the iTunes Store as [...] The band later co-headlined Oxegen 2009 in July along with newly re-formed Blur. The band joined Blur again to co-headline the T in the Park, just two days after the Oxegen Festival. The band returned to Germany to headline the Sonnenrot Festival. The show, though had to be cancelled due to torrential rains. The band followed with Rockhal, T-Mobile Street Gig, Stimmen Festival and Open R Festival. In August, the band will play at the Sziget Festival, and the Pukkelpop Festival. After the band's concert at the Street Gig in Dettenheim, lead singer Gary Lightbody broke a rib in a go-karting accident. Lightbody was livid with himself: [...] "I had my very best idiot trousers on in Germany at the Street gig and we did a go-kart track in Dettenheim. I did say beforehand that I shouldn’t go on them as firstly I shouldn't be in charge of anything that can go over 20miles an hour and secondly I am the most accident-prone idiot in the western world. Did I heed my own advice? Did I fuck! So on I went and crash after crash later; finishing on a particularly nasty one that put took me to hospital where I discovered I have a broken rib. Sweet." [...] He made a full recovery and resumed touring in a few days. Months later, in October 2009, Lightbody revealed the [...] "truth" [...] behind his crash, admitting that he can't drive. He went on the explain the exact details of what had happened: [...] "At the very last corner, I skidded to miss Jonny (Quinn) and I smashed {{into the side of the}} wall and actually came out of the go-kart. It was hilarious - for everyone who was watching. Everyone thought it was just me being me, 'Ah...leave him, he's fine.' But, an hour later, I was in hospital. It was good actually having a real injury rather than all <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> make up in my head." [...] He also admitted his bandmates didn't believe he was actually hurt, as he was a [...] "drama queen".|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>I</b> have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
