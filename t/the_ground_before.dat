5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, close to <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>before</b> it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt failed, and Mehmed {{marched to the}} Wallachian capital of Târgovişte, where he discovered an additional 20,000 impaled Turks. The Sultan and his troops then sailed to Brăila and burned it to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> retreating to Adrianople. Both sides would claim victory, while Mehmed II's forces returned home with many captured slaves, horses and cattle.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit.

5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E

On 28 June 1948, Dick Turpin, brother of Randolph Turpin, became the first non-white boxer to win a British title in a fight against Vince Hawkins in front of 40,000 spectators after the British Boxing Board of Control lifted their ban on non-whites challenging for titles. On 21 June 1972 Danny McAlinden defeated Jack Bodell in a British and Empire Heavyweight title fight.|$|E
5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital {{emergency}} situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The IDF command {{did not see}} {{the forces}} in the western Negev as {{sufficient}} to fully stop an Egyptian invasion, wherever it was headed, and ordered an operation to stop or delay the advancing column. The command also feared that the Arab forces would try to create facts on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the impending UN-imposed ceasefire. The two Arab forces that were considered a threat were the Iraqis in the Triangle (Jenin–Nablus–Tulkarm) and the Egyptians at Majdal–Isdud. Thus, Golani and Carmeli were to attack Jenin, Alexandroni was to harass Tulkarm, and Givati was to attack Isdud.|$|E

5|$|The {{first ten}} years {{following}} Kenilworth Road's renovation saw average attendances of between 15,000 and 18,000; a huge improvement {{on what the}} club had previously been able to attract. Floodlights were installed at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the 1953–54 season, and used {{for the first time}} in a friendly against Turkish side Fenerbahçe on 7 October 1953. The Oak Road terrace was extended in 1955, and promotion to the First Division for 1955–56 saw the average attendance climb as high as 21,454.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E
5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs around outside Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes on inside the house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. Soon, there is a noise in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda going to call the police.|$|E

5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E
5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side}} of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>before</b> the fires were finally put out. A copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E
