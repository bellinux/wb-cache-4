40|$|During receptor-mediated endocytosis, AP 2 {{complexes}} act as {{a bridge}} between the cargo membrane proteins and the clathrin coat by binding <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> signals via the μ 2 subunit and to clathrin via the β subunit. Here we show that binding of AP 2 <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> signals in vitro is regulated by phosphorylation of the μ 2 subunit of AP 2. Phosphorylation of μ 2 enhances the binding affinity of AP 2 for sorting motifs as much as 25 -fold compared with dephosphorylated AP 2. The recognition of sorting signals was not affected by the phosphorylation status of the α or β 2 subunit, suggesting that phosphorylation of μ 2 is critical for regulation of AP 2 binding <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> signals. Phosphorylation of μ 2 occurs at a single threonine residue (Thr- 156) and is mediated by the newly discovered adaptor-associated kinase, AAK 1, which copurifies with AP 2. We propose that phosphorylation of the AP 2 μ 2 subunit by AAK 1 ensures high affinity binding of AP 2 <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> signals of cargo membrane proteins during the initial steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis...|$|R
40|$|A student’s {{peers are}} often thought to {{influence}} {{his or her}} educational outcomes. If so, an unequal distribution of advantaged and disadvantaged students across schools (“sorting”) in a community will amplify existing inequalities. This paper explores {{the relationship between the}} degree of sorting across schools within a community and educational inequality as measured by the variance of standardized high school exam scores within the community. Cross-sectional OLS estimates suggest that the vari-ance of test scores is related <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> by ethnicity, but not <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> by income or parental education. We then implement two strategies for addressing endogeneity in the degree of sorting: a standard un-observed effects (first-difference) approach, and a first-difference/instrumental variables approach in which the structure of school choice (number and relative size of schools) is used to construct instru-ments for the degree of sorting. The results from both approaches indicate that the variance of test scores is related <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> by home language and parental education, but not <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> by income. Our results also suggest that reducing sorting would have little effect on inequality of outcomes in the typical Alberta community, but would have substantial effects in the larger cities...|$|R

5|$|The {{repertoire}} of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, {{political and military}} struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as kunqu. Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems have been used <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion {{in this type of}} play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either daxi (serious) or xiaoxi (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that when the cytosolic domains of the type I {{membrane}} proteins TGN 38 and lysosomal glycoprotein 120 (lgp 120) are added to a variety of reporter molecules, the resultant chimeric molecules are localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and to lysosomes, respectively. In the present study we expressed chimeric constructs of rat TGN 38 and rat lgp 120 in HeLa cells. We found that targeting information in the cytosolic domain of TGN 38 could be overridden by the presence of the lumenal and transmembrane domains of lgp 120. In contrast, the presence of the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of TGN 38 was sufficient to deliver the lumenal domain of lgp 120 to the trans-Golgi network. On the basis of steady-state localization of the various chimeras and antibody uptake experiments, we propose that there is a hierarchy of targeting information in each molecule contributing <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> within the endocytic pathway. The lumenal and cytosolic domains of lgp 120 contribute <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> and delivery <b>to</b> lysosomes, whereas the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of TGN 38 contribute <b>to</b> <b>sorting</b> and delivery <b>to</b> the trans-Golgi network...|$|R
