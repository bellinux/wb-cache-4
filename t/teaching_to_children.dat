The theoretical framework used in this research is international comparative analysis via questionnaire, institutional analysis (training programme), discourse analysis(interview) and classroom observation based on Crossley and Vulliamy's ??case for the case??(1984) method. The efficiency of the training programme is evaluated by (i) studying satisfaction of the teachers after training, whether knowledge and hands-on teaching tasks provided were successful {{to prepare them for}} real classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> with special needs, (ii) relevant views of teachers about the training programme and (iii) observation of teachers teaching as per the training model.

40|$|Humour in children’s {{literature}} in the tertiary and intermediate phases of language education Humour is essential {{in the development of}} an individual and {{in the development of a}} healthy society in general, and research on humour is currently regarded as important in a variety of disciplines in the humanities. There are various ways in which an individual may be exposed to humour, and one of these is children’s stories. An instrument or model for studying humour in children’s stories is necessary and very useful: an instrument that takes into account developmental psychology, literary theory and the nature of humour. When these are combined, the nature, scope and effect of humour in children’s stories can be determined. This article explores ways in which such a model can be used at tertiary level in undergraduate and graduate studies, in teacher training and at the intermediate level when facilitating reading as one of the learning aims in language <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> from eight to twelve years (roughly Grades 4 to 6). Humour can be an instrument in the hands of authors and of adults as mediator or facilitator to sensitise young readers to humour in stories. As a consequence of this process of sensitising, readers’ reading and life skills are developed and their horizon of experience is broadened...|$|E

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Fun to Learn for the Young (FLY) program using randomized controlled trial design with no blinding of participants. Participants included 200 Hong Kong Chinese parent-child dyads (intervention: 101; control: 99) with children aged 18 months from disadvantaged backgrounds. Participants were recruited from three non-governmental organizations. The intervention group participated in the 60 -session FLY program which consisted of direct <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> and parent training. Parent participants from both groups completed questionnaires on child learning, child behavior and parenting before the intervention, at the end of 40 sessions, and 60 sessions. The children were individually assessed on their preschool concepts and language skills at these three time points. Results indicated that the children in the intervention group made more gains in preschool concepts, language skills, school readiness and motivation, compared with control group children (eta (p) (2) =. 018 -. 029). The results provided some initial evidence that the FLY program was an effective early intervention program in promoting child learning.

Special {{attention is paid to}} the differences in the approach of teachers at schools with classes specialized in the tuition of children with LD, schools with extensive language teaching and schools with no specialization. The results indicate that the majority of teachers agree with the integration of pupils with LD into mainstream schools and they favour their exemption from second foreign language study. The individual types of schools differ mainly in the approach towards the presentation of new grammar, in the types of exercises used for the development of communication skills and in the forms of testing and evaluation.

40|$|Introduction. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine Kanō Jigorō’s {{intellectual}} development and pedagogical conceptualization of jūdō as an education for children, and the struggles that jūdō would endure during his life and after his passing in achieving this goal. In addition, we examine the potential merit which Shōnen jūdō-no-kata (“Forms of jūdō for juveniles”, a recreational teaching program for children that involves randori, atemi and emphasis of jū [non-resistance]) deserves in children’s jūdō in the light of that struggle. Material and methods. To achieve this, we offer a critical analysis of the available scholarly studies on the way jūdō has been taught to children in the West, when compared to Japan. We also analyze the history of jūdō for children hereby making use of both Western and Japanese resources. Results. Contrary to what is often purported, Western-style jūdō practice appears to exert mostly negative effects on the mental and social development of children, hereby increasing aggression, violence, social dysfunction and body image dysphoria. However, jūdō instruction programs which emphasize traditional values such as self-discipline and self-control, and which included kata but avoided competitive fighting, significantly improved academic achievement and social behavior in normal children and in those with a history of delinquency. Western jūdō <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> in the form of fighting or games overemphasizes competition and winning, and in this way contradicts the intentions of jūdō’s founder. Conclusions. Shōnen jūdō-no-kata shuns the competitive element and brings children’s jūdō instruction back closer to Kanō’s intentions...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} examining parenting variables {{in relation to}} the development of prosocial reasoning in children has been minimal. Here, 27 two-parent families with a ﬁrst-born four-and-one-half-year-old child were studied. Children’s prosocial reasoning was measured using Eisenberg’s Prosocial Reasoning Task. Aspects of a model of socialization proposed by Darling and Steinberg (1991) which includes parenting values, styles and practices were used here to generate predictions regarding preschoolers’ socialization. Parents’ authoritativeness of style was measured based on Baumrind’s paradigm (1971). Also measured were the values parents chose as being important for their children, and parents’ moral orientation (care versus justice) in the stories they told regarding value <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children.</b> Finally, parents’ sophistication of care reasoning was measured using a dilemma from Skoe’s (1991) Ethic of Care Interview (ECI). The correlations of these various parenting variables with children’s prosocial reasoning generally were weak and non-signiﬁcant. The few exceptions to this were that authoritative mothering was positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with daughters’ choice to help the needy other, mothers’ sophistication of care reasoning was negatively and signiﬁcantly correlated with sons’ choice to help the needy other, and fathers’ sophistication of care reasoning was negatively and signiﬁcantly correlated with daughters’ use of hedonistic reasoning. It was suggested that parental stylistic variations such as those studied here may not have had time to operate extensively enough on the domain of preschoolers’ reasoning about moral issues in order to have an observable relationship with children’s varying abilities in prosocial reasoning...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{effectiveness}} of mathematics <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> aged 9 - 10 years, applies a mixture of six methods to classroom-level data collected in England and China, correlates observable teacher behaviours with pupil mathematics performance and collects multiple perceptions that indirectly connect with the differences of teaching and learning cross-nationally. It has been found in the study that 9 -to 10 -year-olds (n = 343) from China outscored their English peers (n = 236) at the same age by over 20 per cent in each of two mathematics tests derived from TIMSS 2003. Structured analysis of lesson videos has revealed that Chinese mathematics teachers scored much higher than their English colleagues on an internationally validated observation instrument which focused on the quality of six dimensions of teacher behaviours. Furthermore, the quantity of teacher behaviours was also measured and the subsequent correlational analysis on pooled data indicated a positive effect of whole-class interactive teaching (r = 0. 97, p < 0. 01) and pupil time on task (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 01) and a negative impact of whole-class lecture (r = - 0. 91, p < 0. 01), individual/group work (r=- 0. 81, p < 0. 05) and classroom management (r = - 0. 77, p < 0. 05) on pupils’ mathematics performance cross-nationally. Qualitative findings are connected with quantitative results to explain how teachers think, how this relates to the way they teach and how the differences of teaching result in the performance gap cross-nationally. The study replicated previous TER findings from the West across two geographically and culturally different countries, suggested possible directions for future enquiries,and recommended potential ways for practice and policy innovations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to find out the social problems presented in the novel Pride and Prejudice and to reveal the moral values in this novel. The data of this study were from the novel Pride and Prejudice, and the structural approach was used in this research. Two major subjects are found: social Problems and moral values. The first concerns women’s position, a gap between the upper and lower classes, and matchmaking. In Pride and Prejudice, women are portrayed as being weak. They have no economic independence. In marriage, they tend to marry for property and security. For this, they will marry a man who is very rich and marry for a comfortable home. Women are also expected to be always beautiful and accomplished. A gap of the upper and the lower classes can be seen through the social manner of the upper class toward the lower. Forbidden marriage among people of the upper and the lower class is another case in this. Meanwhile, matchmaking among the members of the upper and among the persons from different classes can be seen another social problem. The second concern the facts that one should not judge a person by appearance; one cannot force another; pride of someone can cause prejudice of someone else; and {{it is not easy to}} understand one’s character. The following moral values are found: one can make friends with anybody though different in characters; experience is a good teacher; regrets always come late; parent’s <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> can influence personality in adults; reading books can make people wise; and wealth and rank can cause people to be haughty and selfish. The next moral values concern the facts that one should love and give affection to one’s siblings and that marriage by sex, beauty, and youth instead of morality, love and intelligence results in unhappiness...|$|E

40|$|Explanatory Note: 1. 8 Resource {{teaching}} is teaching that is provided {{to children with}} special needs in addition to ordinary classroom teaching. It is provided in order to allow {{children with special needs}} to achieve their educational potential in a mainstream setting. 1. 9 The current system for allocating resource <b>teaching</b> <b>to</b> <b>children</b> with special needs involves the use of categories of special need. The category of special need a child is assessed as belonging within sets the parameters for the additional teaching resource to be allocated in respect of the child. The categories of special need that form the basis of allocation of resource teaching hours in primary schools are set out in Department of Education Circular SP ED 02 / 05 which was issued for the purpose of providing guidance for mainstream primary schools. 1. 10 Under the current system, a child who is assessed as having a mild learning disability may receive resource teaching support from block allocations of resource hours that are made to schools by the Department. The system whereby schools are allocated block hours in order to cater for the needs of children within certain categories of special need is known as the General Allocation Model (GAM). Under the GAM, blocks of resource hours are given to schools at a level that is calculated with reference {{to the size of the}} schools and other factors such as gender and socio-economic disadvantage within the school. These block hours are allocated to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs. For children assessed as being within other categories of special need, known as low incidence categories of special need, individual allocations of teaching hours are made to schools in respect of the specific child so assessed. Under the arrangements set out in Circular SP ED 02 / 05, Down Syndrome is not included as a specific category of special need recognised for the purpose of allocating resource teaching hours to individual children. 1. 11 Information from the schools received during the course of the examination and investigation indicated that the children who were the focus of the complaints in this case were both receiving resource teaching hours under GAM at the time the complaints were made. The resource teaching the children were receiving was as a result of having been assessed as being within the mild learning disability category of special need. 1. 12 Both complainant mothers contended that the special needs of their children arising from Down Syndrome are quite different from those arising from a mild learning disability. Both mothers asserted that the current system for allocating resource teaching does not take account of the multiplicity of special needs that arise for children with Down Syndrome. Both mothers stated that they felt Down Syndrome should be recognised as a category of special need giving rise to individual allocations of resource teaching hours...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between Grade 7 boys’ and girls’ beliefs and attitudes towards mathematics learning and parents’ views, and family circumstances (e. g., parental education and occupation, home language, number of siblings, and economic resources) in Mozambique. The study was inspired by on-going concerns about persistent patterns of gender differences in mathematics achievement favouring boys among grade 6 pupils in Mozambique (Saito, 2004, 2010). Although gender issues and affective factors in mathematics education have received considerable attention in the western countries, a review of the literature revealed that there is a lack of research in this field in primary schools in Mozambique. Thus, this study was aimed at filling this gap. A convenience sample composed of 300 Grade 7 pupils (134 boys and 166 girls), 225 parents or guardians of these children (98 fathers, 96 mothers, and 31 guardians), and five principals (3 males and 2 females) from participating schools took part in the study. The ages of the children varied from 11 to 16 and the mean age was 12. 9. The dependent variables examined included: perceived achievement; occupational aspirations; confidence in learning mathematics; perceived usefulness of mathematics; causal attributions for success and failure in mathematics; gender stereotyping of mathematics; and parent involvement in education. These variables were examined due to their relationships with task-choices, persistence, and achievement (Eccles et al., 1983). Pen-and-paper surveys and interviews were used to gather quantitative and qualitative data. The main findings of the study were: • Boys and girls viewed mathematics as the most difficult subject. Similarly, parents believed mathematics was the worst subject for their children. • The children’s perceived usefulness of mathematics was strongly associated with age, education of parent, geolocation, and number of siblings. Having electricity, piped water, television set, computer, and internet access were positively associated with perceived usefulness of mathematics and confidence, but not with perceived achievement in mathematics. • Having calculators, cell phones, textbooks, and language spoken at home were not associated with children’s affect towards mathematics. • Boys and parents tended to view mathematics learning as a male domain reflecting the traditional belief, identified in the 1970 s, that mathematics is a male preserve (Fennema & Sherman, 1976). In contrast, girls tended to view mathematics learning as a gender-neutral domain. • Boys’ and girls’ attributions for success and failure in mathematics were not functional (Meyer & Koehler, 1990) as they believed that the most plausible cause for their success was environment (e. g., teacher, help) and for their failure it was task difficulty (e. g., hard mathematics). Parents’ attributions in regard to failure were consistent with those of their children but for success were not. Parents believed success in mathematics is achieved through effort. • Consistent with the literature, girls preferred to engage in ‘people-oriented’ occupations and boys preferred ‘things-oriented’ occupations. Parents’ occupational aspirations for their daughters and sons followed the same pattern. This study was conducted only in one province in Mozambique. Thus, further research is necessary to substantiate the findings from this study in other Mozambican Provinces.
