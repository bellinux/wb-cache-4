First, Eshebly-Mori-Tanaka method {{was used to}} study Thermal Stress Field of rod-shaped oxide eutectic ceramics, and then average strain of rod-shaped oxide eutectic ceramics aroused thermal inconsistency is obtained.

Rod-shaped oxide eutectic ceramics is transverse isotropy and has two independent <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The results show that the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of rod shaped oxide eutectic ceramics are dependent on the diameter of nano-fiber.

The most commercially important of these have {{the distinction of being}} impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero.

25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). <b>Thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{influence}} of Blue and white porcelain of the Yuan and Ming dynasties {{is evident in}} many ceramics made by Muslim potters. İznik pottery from around İznik in Anatolia {{was supported by the}} Ottoman court and produced the finest Ottoman work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration. [...] A characteristic bold red was developed. [...] İznik ware had a major influence on European decorative arts: for example, on Italian Maiolica. [...] The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by Miletus ware from the same region. Its best period lasted until the late 16th century. [...] It consists of a body, slip, and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.” The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain lead oxide as well as soda”; the lead oxide would help reduce the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the ceramic. Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles. Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The linear <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> of <b>coefficients</b> of {{unidirectional}} composites are systematically {{studied by}} the Finite Element Method (FEM). <b>Thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> coeffi-cients are first determined for composites with perfectly bonded interface between fiber and matrix. Results are compared with available experimental and analytical results. Next cracks caused by debonding along the fiber-matrix interface are studied {{to investigate the}} effects of interface cracking on the transverse <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Due {{to the presence of}} cracks and shearing along the debonded interface, the principal direction of transverse ther-mal expansion changes. The obtained results show that the transverse <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> co-efficients change significantly due to the presence of thin interfacial cracks.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{temperature}} versus thermal deformation (strain) {{with respect to}} time, of different coating films were studied by a non-destructive technique (NDT) known as shearography. An organic coating, i. e., epoxy, a white enamel, and a yellow Acrylic Lacquer on a metallic alloy, i. e., carbon steels, were investigated at a temperature range simulating the severe weather temperatures in Kuwait especially between the daylight and the night time temperatures, 20 - 60 0 C. The investigation focused on determining the in-plane displacement of the coatings, which amounts to the thermal deformation (strain) {{with respect to the}} applied temperature range. Furthermore, the investigation focused on determining the <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of coatings (1 & 2), the slope of the plot of the thermal deformation (strain) versus the applied temperature range.
