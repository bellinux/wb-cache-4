We demonstrate that in vitro-generated pDCs stimulated with CpG or virus impaired the development of human autologous CD 34 (+) CD 1 a(-) <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> cells into the T-cell lineage. Rescue by addition of neutralizing type I interferon (IFN) antibodies strongly implies that endogenously produced IFN-alpha/beta is responsible for this inhibitory effect. Consistent with this notion, we show that exogenously added IFN-alpha had a similar impact on IL- 7 - and Notch ligand-induced development of thymic CD 34 (+) CD 1 a(-) progenitor cells into T cells, because induction of CD 1 a, CD 4, CD 8, and TCR/CD 3 surface expression and rearrangements of TCRbeta V-DJ gene segments were severely impaired. In addition, IL- 7 -induced proliferation but not survival of the developing <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> cells was strongly inhibited by IFN-alpha. It is evident from our data that IFN-alpha inhibits the IL- 7 R signal transduction pathway, although this could not be attributed to interference with either IL- 7 R proximal (STAT 5, Akt/PKB, Erk 1 / 2) or distal (p 27 (kip 1), pRb) event...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytokine}} IL- 15 and the inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) 2, which negatively {{regulates the}} activity of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, {{have been shown to}} play key roles in NK cell development. Consistent with this, exogenous IL- 15 added to human <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> cells stimulated their development into NK cells at the expense of T cells both in fetal thymic organ culture and in coculture with stromal cells expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like 1. Overexpression of Id 2 in <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> cells stimulated NK cell development and blocked T cell development. This, in part, is attributed to inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the E protein HEB, which we show in this study is the only E protein that enhanced T cell development. Notably, Id 2 increased a pool of lineage CD 1 a(-) CD 5 (+) progenitor cells that in synergy with IL- 15 furthered expansion and differentiation into NK cells. Taken together, our findings point to a dualistic function of Id 2 in controlling T/NK cell lineage decisions; T cell development is impaired by Id 2, most likely by sequestering HEB, whereas NK cell development is promoted by increasing a pool of CD 1 a(-) CD 5 (+) NK cell progenitors, which together with IL- 15 differentiate into mature NK cells.

In the present work, we analyze the effect of transient stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway in the differentiation potential of Lin–CD 34 CD 1 a – human <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors,</b> a multipotent and heterogeneous cell population that has the capacity to develop into T cells, NK cells, monocytes, cDC, and pDC. Our results demonstrate that giving a boost to ca-nonical Wnt signaling, triggered by transient exposure to Wnt 3 a or LiCl, the differentiation capacity of <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> changes, enhancing NK cell production. On the contrary, Wnt 3 a- or LiCl-pretreated thymic progeni-tors generate a significantly lower number of myeloid lineage cells, monocytes, and cDC and exhibit a re-duced capacity to differentiate into pDC lineage. As a possible mechanism for this effect, we show that Wnt 3 a- and LiCl-pretreated progenitors change their membrane levels of receptors for cytokines pivotal for their expansion and differentiation, such as Flt 3 L. More-over, canonical Wnt pathway stimulation modifies the transcription factor profile of CD 34 CD 1 – thymocytes, increasing Hes- 1 and ID 3 expression levels. J. Leukoc.

Modulation of niche size can be a useful therapeutic tool, and {{a better understanding of}} the factors that control the size of immune cell niches can lead to more targeted therapies. Here bone marrow and thymic niches were modulated with tyrosine kinase inhibition to achieve increased engraftment following stem cell transplantation (SCT). SCT resulting in mixed chimerism is curative for several benign blood diseases, but toxicities associated with myeloablative and cytotoxic conditioning regimens limit the application of SCT. Sunitinib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases including KIT, an essential survival signal within the hematopoietic stem cell and <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> niches. Sunitinib therapy diminishes hematopoietic and <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> cells in mice and enhances accessibility of marrow and thymic niches to transplanted bone marrow. This provides a novel, non-cytotoxic approach to accomplish mixed hematopoietic chimerism. The observation that T cells undergo increased proliferation and accumulate in IL- 7 R deficient mice compared to other lymphopenic hosts raised questions about the factors that control the size of the T cell niche. Understanding these factors is useful in designing therapeutics to increase T cell responses for treatment of many diseases including cancer. Dendritic cells (DCs) are well known for their ability to modulate T cell responses; however, very little is known about the role of IL- 7 R signaling on DCs. The data presented here show that bone marrow derived DCs treated with IL- 7 were less able to induce T cell proliferation in coculture. In vivo systems using CD 11 cDTR mice showed a role for IL- 7 signaling on CD 11 c+ cells in T cell homeostasis. Together these data suggest that IL- 7 R signaling on DCs is important for regulating the size of the T cell niche. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E

We studied <b>thymic</b> settling <b>progenitors</b> from murine embryonic day 13 and 18 thymi by two complementary in vitro and in vivo techniques, both based on the "hanging drop" method. This method allowed colonizing irradiated fetal thymic lobes with E 13 and/or E 18 <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> distinguished by CD 45 allotypic markers and thus following their progeny. Colonization with mixed populations allows analyzing cell autonomous differences in biologic properties of the progenitors while colonization with either population removes possible competitive selective pressures. The colonized thymic lobes can also be grafted in immunodeficient male recipient mice allowing the analysis of the mature T cell progeny in vivo, such as population dynamics of the peripheral immune system and colonization of different tissues and organs. Fetal thymic organ cultures revealed that E 13 progenitors developed rapidly into all mature CD 3 (+) cells and gave rise to the canonical γδ T cell subset, known as dendritic epithelial T cells. In comparison, E 18 progenitors have a delayed differentiation and were unable to generate dendritic epithelial T cells. The monitoring of peripheral blood of thymus-grafted CD 3 (-/-) mice further showed that E 18 <b>thymic</b> settling <b>progenitors</b> generate, with time, larger numbers of mature T cells than their E 13 counterparts, a feature that could not be appreciated in the short term fetal thymic organ cultures...|$|R

Culture of purified murine CD 3 - 4 - 8 - thymocytes on HTSC for 1 d resulted in the appearance of CD 4 + 8 + cells, which did not occur when the sorted cells were maintained in medium alone. It is remarkable that when the culture period was extended to 2 d, CD 3 - 4 - 8 - progenitors differentiated further to CD 4 + 8 - and CD 4 - 8 + cells, which also expressed high levels of TCR-CD 3. This rapid differentiation on stroma in vitro appears to outpace parallel development in vivo. The differentiation potential of a subset of CD 3 - 4 - 8 - thymocytes that express high levels of a marker of normal and neoplastic <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors,</b> the 1 C 11 antigen, was examined next. 1 C 11 hiCD 3 - 4 - 8 - cells also gave rise to CD 4 - 8 + and CD 4 + 8 + populations after 1 d of culture on HTSC. Extending the culture period to 2 d resulted in a significant percentage of CD 3 - expressing cells that were CD 4 + 8 +, CD 4 + 8 - and CD 4 - 8 + cells. These results suggest that in the in vitro HTSC culture system, various subsets of immature thymocytes can differentiate into all the mature phenotypes of cells normally found in the adult mouse thymus.

Progenitor {{entry into}} the thymus is selective, but the molecular basis of this selectivity is incompletely understood. The chemokine receptor CCR 9 has been demonstrated {{to be important in}} this process. However, progenitors lacking CCR 9 can still enter the thymus, suggesting a role for additional molecules. Here we report that the chemokine receptor CCR 7 is also required for efficient thymic settling. CCR 7 is selectively expressed on bone marrow progenitors previously shown to have the capacity to settle the thymus, and CCR 7 −/− progenitors are defective in settling the thymus. We further demonstrate that CCR 7 sustains thymic settling in the absence of CCR 9. Mice deficient for both CCR 7 and CCR 9 have severe reductions in the number of early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors,</b> and in competitive assays CCR 7 −/−CCR 9 −/− double knockout progenitors are almost completely restricted from thymic settling. However, these mice possess near-normal thymic cellularity. Compensatory expansion of intrathymic populations can account for at least a part of this recovery.

Surprisingly CD 5 was also expressed on these in vitro generated ILCs.

40|$|Although {{transcriptional}} programs {{associated with}} T-cell specification and commitment have been described, the functional hierarchy and {{the roles of}} key regulators in structuring/orchestrating these programs remain unclear. Activation of Notch signaling in uncommitted precursors by the thymic stroma initiates the T-cell differentiation program. One regulator first induced in these precursors is the DNA-binding protein T-cell factor 1 (Tcf- 1), a T-cell-specific mediator of Wnt signaling. However, the specific contribution of Tcf- 1 to early T-cell development and the signals inducing it in these cells remain unclear. Here we assign functional significance to Tcf- 1 as a gatekeeper of T-cell fate and show that Tcf- 1 is directly activated by Notch signals. Tcf- 1 is required at the earliest phase of T-cell determination for progression beyond the early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> stage. The global expression profile of Tcf- 1 -deficient progenitors indicates that basic processes of DNA metabolism are down-regulated in its absence, and the blocked T-cell progenitors become abortive and die by apoptosis.

40|$|SummaryThe TCF- 1 and LEF- 1 {{transcription}} {{factors are}} known to play critical roles in normal thymocyte development. Unexpectedly, we found that TCF- 1 -deficient (Tcf 7 −/−) mice developed aggressive T cell malignancy, resembling human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LEF- 1 was aberrantly upregulated in premalignant Tcf 7 −/− early thymocytes and lymphoma cells. We further demonstrated that TCF- 1 directly repressed LEF- 1 expression in early thymocytes and that conditional inactivation of Lef 1 greatly delayed or prevented T cell malignancy in Tcf 7 −/− mice. In human T-ALLs, an early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> (ETP) subtype was associated with diminished TCF 7 expression, {{and two of the}} ETP-ALL cases harbored TCF 7 gene deletions. We also showed that TCF- 1 and LEF- 1 were dispensable for T cell lineage commitment but instead were required for early thymocytes to mature beyond the CD 4 −CD 8 − stage.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} thymus {{provides an}} inductive environment for T-cell development. Within the thymus, Notch signals are indispensable for imposing the T-cell fate on multipotential hematopoietic progenitors, but the downstream effectors that impart T-lineage specification and commitment {{are not well}} understood. Here we show that transcription factor, T-cell factor 1 (TCF- 1), is a critical regulator in T-cell specification. TCF- 1 is highly expressed in the earliest <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors,</b> and its expression is upregulated by Notch signals. Most importantly, when TCF- 1 is forcibly expressed in BM progenitors, it drives the development of T-lineage cells {{in the absence of}} T-inductive Notch 1 signals. Further characterization of these TCF- 1 -induced cells revealed expression of many T-lineage genes, including T-cell specific transcription factors Gata 3, Bcl 11 b, and components of the T-cell receptor. Our data suggest a model where Notch signals induce TCF- 1, and TCF- 1 in turn imprints the T-cell fate by upregulating expression of T-cell essential genes. Within the thymus, Notch 1 signals drive development through sequential steps during which alternative lineage potentials are lost and T-lineage specific gene expression (specification) occurs 1 – 4. Notch is necessary for early T-cell development but its downstream effectors remain unclear 5 – 7. We found that HMG box transcription factor, TCF- 1, is highly upregulated in early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> (ETPs) (Fig. 1 a). Indeed, TCF- 1 expression is upregulated when progenitors are exposed to Notch 1 signals 8.

We studied whether sunitinib, a multityrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits KIT, enhances engraftment after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice. Sunitinib diminished hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers, and sunitinib enhanced marrow, peripheral myeloid, and lymphoid engraftment after BMT in Rag 1 −/− mice. Sunitinib augmented HSC engraftment because recipients displayed increased myeloid and lymphoid engraftment and because sunitinib-treated recipients of purified HSCs showed enhanced engraftment of secondary hosts. However, sunitinib preferentially augmented T-cell engraftment with lesser effects on myeloid and HSC engraftment. Consistent with this, sunitinib preferentially depleted the early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> subset in the thymus. Sunitinib did not increase engraftment in mice with deficient KIT signaling, and the pattern of more potent effects on T cell compared with HSC engraftment observed in sunitinib-treated hosts was also observed after BMT into KITW/Wv mice.

We show that decreased androgen signaling leads to enhanced immigration of bone marrow T-cell precursors, as manifested by both an early increase of early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> (ETP) and improved uptake of adoptively transferred quantified precursors into congenic castrated hosts. We provide evidence that the ETP niche is enhanced after androgen withdrawal by proliferation of UEA+ thymic epithelial cells (TEC) and increased TEC production of CCL 25, a ligand critical for ETP entry. Moreover, the greatest increase in CCL 25 production is by UEA+ TEC, linking function of this subset with the increase in ETP immigration. Furthermore, blockade of CCL 25 abrogated the effects of castration by impairing ETP entry, retarding immature thymocyte development, limiting increase of thymic size, and impairing increase of thymopoiesis. Taken together, these findings describe a cohesive mechanism underlying increased thymic productivity after androgen withdrawal...|$|R
40|$|The thymus plays a {{critical}} role in the maturation and production of T lymphocytes and is a target of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Using the SIV/macaque model of AIDS, we examined the early effects of SIV on the thymus. We found that thymic infection by SIV resulted in increased apoptosis 7 – 14 d after infection, followed by depletion of thymocyte progenitors by day 21. A marked rebound in thymocyte progenitors occurred by day 50 and was accompanied by increased levels of cell proliferation in the thymus. Our results demonstrate a marked increase in <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> activity very early in the course of SIV infection, long before marked declines in peripheral CD 4 � T cell counts. Key words: AIDS • T cell homeostasis • apoptosis • animal model • pathogenesis The thymus plays {{a critical}} role in the maturation and production of T lymphocytes (1, 2) and is a target of infection for HIV (3 – 5). Infection of the thymus by HIV is thought to contribute to the depletion of CD 4 � T lymphocytes and the development of AIDS (6 – 9). This i...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the phenotypic and molecular {{characteristics of a}} rare human adult bone marrow (ABM) CD 34 +CD 38 -/loCD 7 +CD 10 - population that comprise 0. 04 % of the total bone marrow mononuclear cells {{in search of a}} human committed T cell progenitor (hCTP). Using multi-color flow cytometry, we investigated our putative hCTP for its cell surface phenotype and sorted cells for molecular analysis. We observed that our putative hCTP population expresses low levels of T cell lineage associated surface markers CD 1 a and CD 5; the chemokine receptors implicated with progenitor migration to the thymus CCR 7, CCR 9, CXCR 6; and lymphoid associated surface markers CD 127, CD 45 RA, and CD 24. Using the comparative CT quantitative PCR method, we established a gene expression profile of our putative hCTP. Molecular analysis reveals that the putative hCTP population lacks expression of T cell lineage genes (Gata- 3, CD 7, CD 3) and the lymphoid lineage associated gene Rag- 1. However, expression of PU. 1 and Id 2 is present in this population, similar to early thymocytes. Based on our results, we conclude that this population resembles the human early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor,</b> and is capable of seeding the thymus...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} 1 (IGF- 1) enhances thymopoiesis {{but given the}} broad {{distribution}} of IGF- 1 receptors (IGF- 1 Rs), its mechanism of action has remained unclear. To identify points of thymic regulation by IGF- 1, we examined its effects on T-cell precursors, thymocytes, and thymic epithelial cells (TECs) in normal and genetically altered mice. In thymus-intact but not thymectomized mice, IGF- 1 administration increased peripheral naive and recent thymic emigrant (RTE) populations, demonstrating its effect on T-cell production, not peripheral expansion. IGF- 1 administration increased bone marrow LSK (lineage−, Sca- 1 +, c-kit+) precursor proliferation and peripheral LSK populations, increased thymocyte populations in a sequential wave of expansion, and proportionately expanded TEC subpopulations and enhanced their chemokine expression. To separate IGF- 1 's effects on thymocytes and TECs, we generated mice lacking IGF- 1 R on thymocytes and T cells. Thymocyte and RTE numbers were decreased in these mice, but IGF- 1 treatment produced comparable thymocyte numbers to similarly treated wild-type mice. We additionally separated thymic- from LSK-specific effects by demonstrating that IGF- 1 increased thymocyte numbers despite impaired early <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitor</b> (ETP) importation in PSGL- 1 KO mice. These results indicate the critical point thymic function regulation by IGF- 1 involves TEC expansion regulating thymocyte precursor entry and facilitating thymocyte development...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{number in}} the mouse thymus {{increases}} steadily {{during the first two}} weeks after birth. It then plateaus and begins to decline by seven weeks after birth. The factors governing these dramatic changes in cell production are not well understood. The data herein correlate levels of High mobility group A 2 protein (Hmga 2) expression with these temporal changes in thymopoiesis. Hmga 2 is expressed at high levels in murine fetal and neonatal early T cell progenitors (ETP), which are the most immature intrathymic precursors, and becomes almost undetectable in these progenitors after 5 weeks of age. Hmga 2 expression is critical for the initial, exponential expansion of thymopoiesis, as Hmga 2 deficient mice have a deficit of ETPs within days after birth, and total thymocyte number is repressed compared to wild type littermates. Finally, our data raise the possibility that similar events occur in humans, because Hmga 2 expression is high in human fetal <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> and falls in these cells during early infancy...|$|R
40|$|T-cell {{differentiation}} {{is driven}} by a complex network of signals mainly derived from the thymic epithelium. In this study we demonstrate in the human thymus that cortical epithelial cells produce bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) and BMP 4 and that both thymocytes and thymic epithelium express all the molecular machinery required for a response to these proteins. BMP receptors, BMPRIA and BMPRII, are mainly expressed by cortical thymocytes while BMPRIB is expressed {{in the majority of}} the human thymocytes. Some thymic epithelial cells from cortical and medullary areas express BMP receptors, being also cell targets for in vivo BMP 2 / 4 signalling. The treatment with BMP 4 of chimeric human–mouse fetal thymic organ cultures seeded with CD 34 + human <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> results in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of the differentiation of human thymocytes from CD 4 − CD 8 − to CD 4 + CD 8 + cell stages. These results support a role for BMP 2 / 4 signalling in human T-cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|A novel conditional-lethal {{transgene}} {{system is}} defined in which a mutated influenza A virus ion-channel protein, which is permeable to monovalent cations, is lethal to cells on heterotypic expression and whose activity can be blocked by an antiviral drug (amantadine), is used to reversibly disrupt T-cell development. In vivo expression of the M 2 ion channel, as a transgene under control of the T-cell specific p 56 (Lck) proximal promoter, resulted in total ablation of T-cell development with the accumulation of three distinct populations of early progenitor cells (CD 44 (+) CD 25 (-); CD 44 (+) CD 25 (+); CD 44 (+) CD 25 (hi)) in the thymic rudiment. In vitro development of transgenic fetal <b>thymic</b> <b>progenitors</b> to single-positive T cells could be rescued by antiviral drug treatment. Moreover, there was a radical reduction in B-cell lymphopoiesis, evident at the pre-B-cell stage, with a twofold increase of lymphoid cells 'in cycle' in transgenic bone marrow, indicative of major changes in haematopoietic homeostasis. This system may provide a generic protocol for conditional, lineage-specific cell ablation with available tissue-specific promoters for any eukaryotic developmental system, and provide a window on early T-cell development...|$|R
