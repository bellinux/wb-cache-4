It was found that 39 chemical compounds repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins) and three terpene compounds attracted bees.

They are strongly aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy. Some have medicinal uses: for example, thymol is an antiseptic and was once used as a vermifuge (anti-worm medicine).|$|E

Sesquiterpenes are <b>terpenes</b> composed of three isoprene units and therefore have 15 carbon atoms. Sesquiterpenes are widely distributed in nature and are found in plants as well as animals, for example in the juvenile hormone of insects. Plants use sesquiterpenes as a defense compound against insects. According to some studies, sesquiterpenes have antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, or immunostimulant effects.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of {{phosphorus}} fertilisation on foliar <b>terpene</b> concentrations and foliar volatile <b>terpene</b> emission rates in six half-sib families of Pinus pinaster Ait. seedlings. Half of the seedlings were resistant to attack of the pine weevil Hylobius abietis L., a generalist phloem feeder, and the remaining seedlings were susceptible to this insect. We hypothesised that P stress could modify the <b>terpene</b> concentration in the needles and thus lead to altered <b>terpene</b> emission patterns relevant to plant-insect signalling. The total concentration and emission rate ranged between 5732 and 13, 995 Î¿gÂ·g - 1 DW and between 2 and 22 Î¿gÂ·g - 1 DWÂ·h - 1, respectively. Storage and emission were dominated by the isomers Î±- and Î²-pinene (77. 2 % and 84. 2 % of the total <b>terpene</b> amount amassed and released, respectively). In both resistant and susceptible families, P stress caused an increase of 31 % in foliar <b>terpene</b> concentration with an associated 5 -fold decrease in <b>terpene</b> emission rates. A higher <b>terpene</b> content in the leaves implies that the 'excess carbon', available under limiting growth conditions (P scarcity), is allocated to <b>terpene</b> production. Sensitive families showed a greater increase in <b>terpene</b> emission rates with increasing P concentrations, which could explain their susceptibility to H. abietis. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis.

5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to <b>terpenes,</b> derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of extracting three major <b>terpene</b> lactones and flavonoids from Ginkgo leaves by using supercritical carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and R 134 a. A semi-batch extraction and absorption process was employed to collect and sequentially dissolve solutes precipitated from supercritical fluids. The extraction conditions ranged from 24. 2 to 31. 2 MPa and from 333 to 393 K. A reverse-phase HPLC system coupled with RI and UV detectors was also used to individually quantify the level of <b>terpene</b> lactones and flavonoid aglycones in the extracts. Experimental data showed that Soxhlet ethanol extraction had the best performance on total yield {{and the amount of}} <b>terpene</b> lactones and flavonoids. Our results further indicated that three dry supercritical fluids, individually at the density of 0. 84, 0. 83 and 1. 13 g/ml, could not extract <b>terpene</b> lactones and flavonoids. However, when ethanol was added to supercritical fluid extraction, the extracted amount of <b>terpene</b> lactones increased with the mole fraction of ethanol addition.

As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing <b>terpenes</b> that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants.

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and <b>terpenes,</b> which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E

40|$|<b>Terpene</b> synthases are {{a family}} of enzymes largely {{responsible}} for synthesizing the vast array of terpenoid compounds known to exist in nature. Formation of terpenoids from their respective 10 -, 15 -, or 20 -carbon atom prenyl diphosphate precursors is initiated by divalent (M 2 +) metal ion-assisted electrophilic attack. In addition to M 2 +, monovalent cations (M+) have {{also been shown to}} be essential for the activity of certain <b>terpene</b> synthases most likely by facilitating substrate binding or catalysis. An apple α-farnesene synthase (MdAFS 1), which has a dependence upon potassium (K+), was used to identify active site regions that may be important for M+ binding. Protein homology modeling revealed a surface-exposed loop (H-αl loop) in MdAFS 1 that fulfilled the necessary requirements for a K+ binding region. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of specific residues within this loop then revealed their crucial importance to this K+ response and strongly implicated specific residues in direct K+ binding. The role of the H-αl loop in <b>terpene</b> synthase K+ coordination was confirmed in a Conifer pinene synthase also using site-directed mutagenesis. These findings provide the first direct evidence for a specific M+ binding region in two functionally and phylogenetically divergent <b>terpene</b> synthases.
