5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> look away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of}} the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing {{to understand what the}} vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

25|$|Thurman's {{involvement}} {{in identifying the}} fragment later proved controversial because of a 1997 report on the FBI Laboratory, unrelated to the PA 103 investigation, written by U.S. Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, which concluded that Thurman had altered lab reports in ways that had rendered them inaccurate, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be transferred to a position outside the FBI lab (The Wall Street Journal, September 26, 1997). Thurman was not called to testify. Potentially also damaging to the Crown's case as presented at the trial, the testimony of Thurman's UK counterpart, DERA's Alan Feraday, has now been called into question. In three separate cases where Feraday had been the expert witness, men against whom he gave evidence have had their convictions overturned. And, thirdly, Dr Thomas Hayes was castigated for his failure to test the timer fragment for explosives residue, even though at the trial he maintained that the fragment {{was too small to}} test. Defence counsel contrasted Hayes' testimony with that of two of his colleagues (Elliott and Higgs) at DERA's forensic laboratory who, as revealed in the notorious Maguire Seven trial, had tested minute samples from underneath the fingernails of the suspects for explosives residue. In another important development, a retired senior Scottish police chief added fuel to the timer fragment fire by claiming that the CIA planted this crucial piece of evidence.|$|E
25|$|England's innings – like Australia's – {{revolved}} around their opener, {{in this case}} Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891–92. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved {{the ball to the}} leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.|$|E
500|$|For {{the trials}} match between the Probables and the Possibles on 18 December 1910 at Colombes, Guillemin {{played for the}} Probables and was then {{selected}} for France. G. Neumeyer writing in la Culture physique, considered that the selectors had {{made the right choice}} of XV, with the exception of Guillemin. In his opinion, it was deplorable that he should be selected, noting his [...] "remarkable brutality", proof of which he demonstrated in the trials match, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be thrown out of the national team for all time.

500|$|Bradley {{develops}} {{a theory about}} Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between [...] "traditional" [...] and [...] "critical" [...] conscience: [...] "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem : [...] "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;" ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{was deeply}} {{depressed}} {{in the months}} following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968.

The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and [...] "told him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> get this woman to write a book". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a [...] "covert hand" [...] in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use [...] "a little reverse psychology", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: [...] "It's just as well", he said, [...] "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible". [...] Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After [...] "closeting herself" [...] in London, it took her two years to write it. [...] She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication.|$|E

500|$|In the House, as {{the session}} began at 4:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a leading {{opponent}} of the Orders, {{drew attention to the}} Prime Minister's absence and remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) {{on his way to the}} House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed [...] "I am murdered!" [...] before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said [...] "Murder" [...] or [...] "Oh my God".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.|$|E
500|$|At his peak in 1882, Crossland was {{considered}} one of the fastest bowlers in England, and his yorker were described as W. G. Grace as being [...] "exceedingly difficult to play."

[...] Grace was scarcely kinder, noting that he was [...] "inclined to think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have been no-balled in every over." [...] Despite the widespread opinion against his action, the umpires, themselves professional, were reluctant to no ball him. There was a feeling in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that [...] "no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [...] their disapproval of it." [...] As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he {{was considered}} a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51.|$|E

2500|$|By nightfall on 6 July, the Austrians, still {{capable of}} action, had broken contact with their pursuers and Charles had managed to {{reestablish}} a cohesive, albeit irregular front. The remarkable combat-worthiness shown during the evening fighting left Napoleon wondering whether the Austrians would actually renew battle the next day. The Emperor rose early on 7 July and reconnoitred the battlefield in person, noting the huge losses in men {{on both sides and}} seeing that the Austrians had withdrawn. He then returned to more practical matters and, after receiving MacDonald's report, he suddenly embraced the general and elevated him to the dignity of Maréchal d'Empire, the only Marshal to receive the title on a field of battle. The Emperor also criticised Marmont for his slowness in arriving on the battlefield and told Oudinot <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have him shot for attacking without orders. The French resumed their pursuit towards 14:00, as the extreme exhaustion of the army prevented an early start. Their artillery had fired somewhere between 90,000 and 100,000 rounds during the battle, which left the caissons empty and it took some time before they could be refilled. Among the rank and file, there were even instances of severe breakdown in troop discipline, as the army moved through county packed with vines and wine cellars. When an incensed Oudinot, sabre in hand, tried to restore discipline among a group of drunken cavalrymen from his army corps, he was almost attacked by his own men. Pursuit was further complicated by the absence of reliable information about the exact direction of the Austrian retreat. Contradictory intelligence collected by the various Corps confusingly stated that the Austrians were retreating either towards to Brünn or to Znaim and other reports were actually indicating a retreat towards Moravia. The French tried to close the gap through sustained march. Spearheading the pursuit were the army corps of Masséna to the west, Marmont in the centre and Davout to the east, while the [...] "Army of Italy" [...] was detailed {{to keep an eye on}} Archduke John's army.|$|E
2500|$|Viewing the {{battlefield}} from horseback {{on the hill}} at Jebel Surgham, Kitchener commented: [...] "Well, we have given them a damn good dusting". As the British and Egyptians advanced in columns, the Khalifa attempted to outflank and encircle the columns; this led to desperate hand-to-hand fighting. Churchill wrote of his own experience as the 21st Lancers cut {{their way through the}} Ansar: [...] "The collision was prodigious and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds, no man heeded his enemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men, sprawling in heaps, struggle dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted and looked about them". The Lancers' onslaught carried them through the 12-men-deep Ansar line [...] with the Lancers losing about 70 dead while killing hundreds of the enemy. Following the annihilation of his army, the Khalifa ordered a retreat and early in the afternoon, Kitchener rode in triumph into Omdurman and immediately ordered that the thousands of Christians enslaved by the Ansar were now all free people. Kitchener lost fewer than 500 men while killing about 11,000 and wounding 17,000 of the Ansar. Burleigh summed the general mood of the British troops: [...] "At Last! Gordon has been avenged and justified. The dervishes have been overwhelming routed, Mahdism has been [...] "smashed", while the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been stripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability." [...] Kitchener promptly had the Mahdi's tomb blown up and his bones scattered. Queen Victoria, who had wept when she heard of General Gordon's death, now wept for the man who had vanquished Gordon, asking whether it had been really necessary for Kitchener to desecrate the Mahdi's tomb. In a letter to his mother, Churchill wrote that the victory at Omdurman had been [...] "disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and...Kitchener is responsible for this". There is no evidence that Kitchener ordered his men to shoot the wounded Ansar on the field of Omdurman, but he did give before the battle what the British journalist Mark Urban called a [...] "mixed message", saying that mercy should be given, {{while at the same time}} saying [...] "Remember Gordon" [...] and that the enemy were all [...] "murderers" [...] of Gordon. The victory at Omdurman made Kitchener into a popular war hero, and gave him a reputation for efficiency and as a man who got things done. The journalist G. W. Steevens wrote in the Daily Mail that [...] "He [...] is more like a machine than a man. You feel <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be patented and shown with pride at the Paris International Exhibition. British Empire: Exhibit No. 1 hors concours, the Sudan Machine". The shooting of the wounded at Omdurman, along with the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb, gave Kitchener a reputation for brutality that was to dog him for the rest of his life, and posthumously.|$|E
