5|$|As the {{political}} conflict escalated into full-scale rebellion in 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. <b>The</b> <b>opposition</b> stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to <b>the</b> <b>opposition,</b> Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of this is the FC Barcelona team, who use a fluid (meaning the players are free to move around and {{exchange}} positions) 4-3-3 formation to use the channels created by <b>the</b> <b>oppositions</b> formation to gain an advantage, e.g. Xavi with the ball in midfield, passing to one of the front three players who start either in <b>the</b> <b>oppositions</b> defensive zone, and drops back towards his midfield, or starting in <b>the</b> <b>oppositions</b> midfield zone, and moves forward. Barcelona's formation, as well as taking advantage of opposition’s channels, also looks to cancel out the chance of their own team creating them, with the use of Sergio Busquets as a defensive midfielder, who looks to occupy the space between his back four and midfield three.|$|R
