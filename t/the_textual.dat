This paper {{describes}} the Bar-Ilan system participating in <b>the</b> Recognising <b>Textual</b> Entailment Challenge. <b>The</b> paper proposes first a general probabilistic setting that formalizes <b>the</b> notion of <b>textual</b> entailment. We then describe a concrete alignment-based model for lexical entailment, which utilizes web co-occurrence statistics {{in a bag}} of words representation. Finally, we report {{the results of the}} model on <b>the</b> Recognising <b>Textual</b> Entailment challenge dataset along with some analysis. ...|$|R

5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by <b>the</b> <b>textual</b> research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to <b>the</b> <b>textual</b> family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people.

The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E

But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers.

5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to <b>the</b> <b>textual</b> summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to <b>the</b> <b>textual</b> Family Π. Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E

5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to <b>the</b> <b>textual</b> summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E
