5|$|Attachment <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} to adult romantic {{relationships in the}} late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E

No evidence of a second manother than a former prison cellmate's claim that Chandler said another man, whose identity the cellmate claimed to know but would not reveal has ever surfaced. The second-suspect <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> belied by Chandler's approach of the two Canadian female touriststhat he was willing to approach more than one potential target by himself.|$|E

He contends, however, that past <b>theories</b> <b>were</b> partly true, and that present <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> largely true. I argue that Alai’s discrimination {{between past and present}} <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> subject to his own criticism against realists’ discriminations between past and present theories, and also subject to other criticisms that philosophers have raised against scientific realism and pessimism...|$|R

40|$|Different {{approaches}} to axionatic field <b>theory</b> <b>are</b> investigated. The main notions of semiclassical <b>theory</b> <b>are</b> the following: semiclassical states, Poincare transformations, semiclassical action form, semiclassical gauge equivalence and semiclassical field. If the manifestly covariant approach is used, {{the notion of}} semiclassical state is related to Schwinger sourse, while the semicalssical action is presented via the R-function of Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann. Semiclassical perturbation <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> constructed. Its relation with the S-matrix <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> investigated.

40|$|First-order shear {{deformation}} theories, one proposed by Reissner {{and another one}} by Mindlin, are widely in use, even today, because of their simplicity. In this paper two new displacement based first-order {{shear deformation}} theories involving only two unknown functions, as against three functions in case of Reissners and Mindlin's <b>theories,</b> <b>are</b> introduced. For static problems, governing equations {{of one of the}} proposed <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> uncoupled. And for dynamic problems, governing equations of one of the <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> only inertially coupled, whereas those of the other <b>theory</b> <b>are</b> only elastically coupled. Both the <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> variationally consistent. The effectiveness of the <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> brought out through illustrative examples. One of the theories has striking similarity with classical plate theory...|$|R
5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} combat. In this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using intimidation displays to cow its rival. If intimidation failed, the Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, striking the rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded upon by Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E
50|$|In model theory, a {{complete}} <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> called stable {{if it does}} not have too many types. One goal of classification <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> not stable then its models are too complicated and numerous to classify, while if a <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> stable there might be some hope of classifying its models, especially if the <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> superstable or totally transcendental.|$|R

The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} {{examples of}} how social <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> used in systematic reviews of complex interventions to inform production of Cochrane guidance. Study Design and SettingSecondary analysis of published/unpublished examples of theories of social phenomena for use in reviews of complex interventions identified through scoping searches, engagement with key authors and methodologists supplemented by snowballing and reference searching. <b>Theories</b> <b>were</b> classified (low-level, mid-range, grand). ResultsOver 100 <b>theories</b> <b>were</b> identified with evidence of proliferation over the last 5  years. New low-level theories (tools, taxonomies, etc) {{have been developed for}} classifying and reporting complex interventions. Numerous mid-range <b>theories</b> <b>are</b> used; one example demonstrated how control theory had changed the review's findings. Review-specific logic models are increasingly used, but these can be challenging to develop. New low-level and mid-range psychological theories of behavior change are evolving. No reviews using grand theory (e. g., feminist <b>theory)</b> <b>were</b> identified. We produced a searchable Wiki, Mendeley Inventory, and Cochrane guidance. ConclusionsUse of low-level <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> common and evolving; incorporation of mid-range <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> still {{the exception rather than the}} norm. Methodological work is needed to evaluate the contribution of theory. Choice of theory reflects personal preference; application of <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> a skilled endeavor...|$|R
