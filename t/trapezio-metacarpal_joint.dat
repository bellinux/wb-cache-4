40|$|Osteoarthritis of the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> is a {{disabling}} {{condition is}} seen very frequently {{in every day}} practice. It is more common among women than men.

40|$|The tendon of flexor pollicis longus angulates at the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> level. The {{degree of}} {{angulation}} varies with extent of radial/ulnar deviation (Rack and Ross [[1984]] J. Physiol. 351 : 99 - 110). We report a fibrous pulley {{at this level}} that helps stabilize the tendon and facilitates its action. The morphology of the pulley is described. We believe that it has {{an important role to}} play in the unique function of the tendon facilitating the movement of the thumb perpendicular to the plane of the thumbnail...|$|E
40|$|Arthritis {{affecting}} the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> (TMJ) of the thumb {{is a very}} common condition, and in the upper limb represents the site most often requiring surgery for symptomatic osteoarthritis. The condition predominantly affects women, espe-cially those who are post menopausal. Management of the condition initially entails the use of conserva-tive measures. Many of these are administered in the community by general practitioners as well as occupational therapists, surgery being reserved for disabling symptoms and loss of function resistant to these measures. From {{a review of the}} currently available literature, we present an overview of this common condition, commenting on its clinical presentation, pathophysi-ology and the treatment options available. A treat-ment algorithm is presented, to aid practitioners in the management and referral of patients with symptomatic thumb TMJ arthritis...|$|E
30|$|Viscosupplementation by {{intra-articular}} injection(s) of {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) is a symptomatic treatment, widely used for treating osteoarthritis {{of the knee}} (Legré-Boyer 2015; Bruyère et al. 2014; Bannuru et al. 2015) and, to a lesser extent, of the hip, ankle, shoulder, and <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b> Whatever the joint to be treated, the therapeutic protocol is usually the same: 3 – 5 injections, 1  week apart, if a linear viscosupplement is used (initial structure of the HA molecule) or 1 – 3 injections when using a cross-linked HA. To date cross-linking is the main means for increasing the intra-articular residence time of the viscosupplement and therefore for {{reducing the number of}} injections (Lindenhayn et al. 1997; Lindqvist et al. 2002). The injected HA is assumed to induce synthesis of endogenous hyaluronic acid (Bagga et al. 2006) which properties are primarily anti-degradative and slightly anti-inflammatory. (du Souich 2014; Henrotin et al. 2013; Li et al. 2012). Compared to corticosteroids, HA acts in a more prolonged but also more delayed way (Bannuru et al. 2009). Therefore, it is common that a steroid is injected with the HA, for pain relief the first 4  weeks during which the HA has not yet had time to act. Although a synergistic effect of the two molecules has been suggested (Grecomoro et al. 1992; Ozturk et al. 2006; de Campos et al. 2013) the impact of corticosteroids on the behavior of HA solutions has never been studied. Some practitioners also use a local anesthetic, as an analgesic to alleviate pain due to the injection, or in a goal to ensure the proper intra-articular needle position when the injection is performed using anatomical landmarks or under ultrasound guidance (Qvistgaard et al. 2001). Again there is no data on the impact of local anesthetics on the visco-elastic behavior of HA.|$|R
40|$|Scapho-trapezoid {{osteoarthritis}} may accompany osteoarthritis of the CM {{joint of}} the thumb. If the scapho-trapezoid joint is not excised when performing an excision of the trapezium with ligament reconstruction and interposition of the tendon of the FCR, the procedure may be unsuccessful. We describe three patients with four thumbs in which scapho-trapezoid steoarthritis {{was associated with}} basal joint arthritis. In one patient, it was not recognised pre-operatively and persistent post-operative pain dictated further surgery. In the other patients, the scapho-trapezoid joint was excised primarily, with resolution of the pain. In the pre-operative assessment, the scapho-trapezoid joint should be carefully studied to prevent failure of the procedure. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B: 3 : 346 - 352 When non-operative treatment fails and pain is present at rest, and interfering with work and social activity, surgery is an option {{for the treatment of}} <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> (TM) <b>joint</b> degenerative and inflammatory arthritis. Several techniques have been described, includ-ing excision arthroplasty (Gervis, 1949; Goldner and Clippinger, 1959), arthrodesis (Carroll and Hill, 1973), resection arthroplasty with tendon interposition with o...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{a realistic}} kinematic {{model of the}} <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> (TM) <b>joint</b> in the human thumb that involves two non-orthogonal and non-intersecting rotation axes. The estimation of the model parameters, i. e. the position and orientation of the two axes with respect to an anatomical coordinate system, {{was carried out by}} processing the motion of nine retroreflective markers, externally attached to the hand surface, surveyed by a video motion capture system. In order to compute the model parameters, prototypical circumduction movements were processed within an evolutionary optimization approach. Quality and reproducibility in assessing the parameters were demonstrated across multiple testing sessions on 10 healthy subjects (both left and right thumbs), involving the complete removal of all markers and then retesting. Maximum errors of less than 5 mm in the axis position and less than 6 in the orientation were found, respectively. The inter-subject mean distance between the two axes was 4. 16 and 4. 71 mm for right and left TM joints, respectively. The inter-subject mean relative orientation between the two axes was about 106 and 113 for right and left TM joints, respectively. Generalization properties of the model were evaluated quantitatively on opposition movements in terms of distance between measured and predicted marker positions (maximum error less than 5 mm). The performance of the proposed model compared favorably with the one (maximum error in the range of 7 – 8 mm) obtained by applying a universal joint model (orthogonal and intersecting axes). The ability of in vivo estimating the parameters of the proposed kinematic model represents a significant improvement for the biomechanical analysis of the hand motion...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} unique {{prospective}} study {{to estimate the}} median sustained stage-related improvement in pain and hand function in patients with <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> osteoarthritis after administration of a single corticosteroid injection. Response to the corticosteroid injection was assessed using Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores. Self assessment scores revealed a reduction in pain and improvement in hand function. All patients reported a significant improvement in pain and hand function (p ≤ 0. 05), regardless of the disease stage. Additionally, we observed a marked difference in the duration of improvement in hand function between early and late stages of the disease (p = 0. 0046). In conclusion, {{it is possible to}} predict the period of symptomatic improvement at each of the four radiological stages of the disease. This would allow the treating clinician to judge the outcome of treatment with reasonable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} short term review of twenty-one De La Caffini~re trapezio-metacarpal {{prostheses}} inserted into twenty patients {{with an average}} review time of fifteen months. Only one case was of rheumatoid arthritis and the main indication for operation was pain. From a functional and symptomatic point of view the results are similar to other series with surgery for trapezio-metacarpal rthritis but due to cup loosening 24 ~ have needed revision, 24070 have loose cups and a further 19070 have lucent cement lines around the cup. This review {{draws attention to the}} worrying frequency of loosening with this prosthesis. Many different types of operation have been devised to treat arthritic changes at the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> and their number demonstrates that none {{have been found to be}} entirely satisfactory. For this reason De La Caffini 6 re developed a cemented total joint replacement and it has been in use since 1971. Apart from his original article in 1979 there has been little published in the English literature so we present our figures of...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the de la Caffinibre cemented prosthesis for arthroplasty of the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint,</b> short-term and intermediate results have been reported by Caffiniere himself (1973), Caffiniere and Aucouturier (1979) Wyss and Segmuller (1980), August et al. (1984) and Boeckstyns et al. (1989). Caffiniere has published the only long-term follow-up, of 22 operations with encouraging results after ten years (Caffiniere and Rothe, 1985). We report a long-term clinical and radiographic evaluation. Full opposition 19122 Can flatten hand 18 / 22 kPa = kilopascals (1 pascal = 1 newton/m&e 2 = 1 kilogramme/metre second. Materials and methods 20 patients with 22 Caffiniere prostheses in the trapezia-metacarpal joint were evaluated at a median of nine years after operation. The indication was degenerative osteoarthrosis in 20 cases and rheumatoid arthritis in two cases. We formd 18 of the 22 (82 %) original prostheses still in place, with satisfactory pain relief and good function. Three hands had been revised due to aseptic loosening, with replacement of two cups and one total prosthesis. Two of the revised prostheses were functioning well 63 and 10 years after the revision. We conclude that function does not deteriorate within the first nine years, that late loosening is not a significant problem with this prosthesis and that, if aseptic loosening occurs, it is possible to obtain good results by replacing the loose component...|$|E
40|$|Several treatments, {{conservative}} or surgical, {{have been proposed}} for painful arthritis of {{the base of the}} thumb with various outcomes. Swanson trapezium implant, arthrodesis of the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> (T. M.) <b>joint</b> and suspension arthroplasty are three of the most used techniques for treatment of this condition. Two hundred patients operated on using one of the three techniques were reviewed for a retrospective study to assess {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each method of treatment and their indications. Patient satisfaction rate is high whatever the technique used. Complete pain relief was obtained more often with the Swanson implant (Alnot 0) but differences between the three methods decrease when patients with pain only for particular strains (Alnot 1) are included. Swanson implants (patient satisfaction Alnot 0 and 1 : 85. 5 %) provide excellent subjective and objective results for patients with light activity of daily living causing little stress to the implant. Complication rate with reoperation is equal to other techniques. Surgical treatment is well come through and recovery is fast and not painful. Suspensioplasty (patient satisfaction Alnot 0 and 1 : 78. 2 %) have a low complication and reoperation rate when the technique is well applied. Patient satisfaction rate is high but duration of recovery is long (strength, nimbleness). T. M. arthrodesis is the only type of surgery providing a good strength identical to the opposite side at the price of a limited decrease of range of motion. In conclusion, we propose the following algorithm: for patients over years of age: Swanson trapezium implant; for young and active patients presenting a radiological stage less than Dell III and an intact Scaphotrapezial joint: T. M. arthrodesis; for other patients: suspensioplasty using the A. P. L...|$|R
40|$|Trapeziometacarpal {{osteoarthritis}} is {{a common}} entity, often bilateral and predominantly affecting postmenopausal women. In the case of failure of conservative treatment, surgery is a good option. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare three surgical procedures. 63 patients (74 thumbs) with osteoarthritis of the <b>trapezio-metacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> were surgically treated; 54 patients were seen for follow-up, 7 had died and 2 were lost to follow-up. The patients were stratified according to treatment; resection arthroplasty (the joint surface’s of the metacarpal and the trapezium are resected) (18 thumbs), trapeziectomy with tendon interposition (17 thumbs) or trapezio-metacarpal arthrodesis (28 thumbs). Baseline characteristics were comparable in the three groups for mean age at operation, Eaton classification, left right distribution and dominant hands operated. The average follow-up was 13 years for the resection group, 8 years for the trapeziectomy group and 9  years for the arthrodesis group. No statistically significant difference between the three groups was found for the visual analogue pain and satisfaction scale, pain frequency nor DASH score. Patients in the trapeziectomy group had significantly less pain compared to the arthrodesis group (p= 0. 025). Statistically, radial abduction was significantly better after trapeziectomy compared to resection arthroplasty (p< 0. 01) or arthrodesis (p= 0. 01). There was no difference among the three groups in grip and tip pinch strength nor in pain on palpation. None of the patients in the trapeziectomy group needed a re-operation, one patient in the resection arthroplasty group had a re-operation, and 22 patients in the arthrodesis group had one or more re-operations for hardware removal or because of a complication. This study shows that the resection arthroplasty has equally good long term results compared to trapeziectomy combined with tendon interposition or arthrodesis. Resection arthroplasty is performed through a single incision and is technically simple. In our clinic resection arthroplasty is therefore the preferred technique for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint...|$|E
