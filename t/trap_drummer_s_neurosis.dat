5000|$|Eventually, Brown {{became the}} third {{member of the}} trio, Gravity 180, which he {{considers}} to be his greatest artistic achievement to date. [...] The {{other members of the}} trio are: Clydene Jackson on keyboards with phenomenal vocals, and Harold Payne on acoustic guitar with superb vocals. Payne and Jackson are the main songwriters for the group. Brown has stated that the group has given him the opportunity to express percussion in a way that could be said to be a percussionist’s dream. Gravity 180 was conceived without the aid of <b>trap</b> <b>drums</b> or a bass player; Jackson plays left hand keyboard bass. This gave Brown the opportunity to cover all the territory of <b>trap</b> <b>drums</b> and percussion in the arrangements of their music (driven by percussion).|$|R

5000|$|... "On My Mind" [...] {{is a song}} by English singer Ellie Goulding {{from her}} third studio album Delirium (2015). It was {{released}} as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015. It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh. [...] "On My Mind" [...] is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, <b>trap</b> <b>drums,</b> slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica. Lyrically, [...] "On My Mind" [...] talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head. Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's [...] "Don't".|$|R
5000|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Idle Delilah," [...] a glitchy mid-tempo track that {{contains}} [...] "tropical, thuggish and quirky" [...] sounds and {{was compared to}} the work of Lauryn Hill due to its use of both rapping and singing, which were noted for being rugged and velvety."Gimme a Chance" [...] contains feather-light synths, an '80s-style sample, bold brass instruments and haphazard DJ scratches. The song's production changes towards the end and takes influence from a bachata groove, while Banks sings in Spanish. [...] "Ice Princess" [...] is an uptempo song that juxtaposes a sample of Morgan Page's 2011 dance song [...] "In The Air" [...] against a heavy <b>trap</b> <b>drum</b> pattern.|$|R

The song moves at a tempo of 134 beats per minute in common time, while Mars' vocals span from A3 to D5, while also reaching up to F5 in the ending adlibs. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone noted that the track [...] "brings the silky vibes of 12 Play-era R. Kelly into the boom of modern trap". In the album review provided by Vulture, Craig Jenkins said that [...] "It's one of the album's best and most modern-sounding cuts by some distance, thanks to a killer vocal and tasteful <b>trap</b> <b>drums</b> (although to be fair, it carries {{more than a passing}} resemblance to Beyoncé and the Neptunes’ B'Day sleeper 'Kitty Kat')".|$|R
5000|$|Wilkerson's best-documented {{ensemble}} as {{a leader}} is 8 Bold Souls, an octet initiated in January 1985 {{with a series of}} Thursday-night concerts at the Chicago Filmmakers performance space. The popularity of the concerts led Wilkerson to establish 8 Bold Souls as a working band, and since their formation, four Souls CDs have been issued: 8 Bold Souls on Sessoms Records, Sideshow and Ant Farm on Arabesque Records, and Last Option on Thrill Jockey. Influenced by the small groups of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford, 8 Bold Souls also makes plenty of room for adventurous experimentation in the AACM spirit, drawing fully on the unusual sonic possibilities of the group's instrumentation of two woodwinds, trumpet, trombone, cello, tuba, bass, and <b>trap</b> <b>drums.</b> Overall, Wilkerson's work may be heard on 14 recordings, including two film soundtracks.|$|R

5000|$|On March 28, 2016, it was {{revealed}} that the album will feature the productions from Key Wane, Detail and Tommy Brown. Big Sean and Jhene Aiko explain what fans might expect on the project. According to Uproxx, the album conjures 90's R&B and 70's experimental rock and soul. It also mixes neo-soul, ambient beats, and <b>trap</b> <b>drums</b> courtesy of producers like Da Internz. As a whole, Twenty88 is a departure from each artist's individual sounds. [...] "It's a wide range. It gets turned up, then it gets melodic, then it gets vibed out. It touches all these things, but it sounds very cohesive. We've created another world. Both me and Sean are super into fantasy-driven movies and so combining stuff like robots and sex, that pretty much sums us up. Robots are sexy as shit. We've created these characters that are extensions of ourselves, it's highly sexual." ...|$|R
