5|$|Styloolithus, another fossil enantiornithine egg {{from the}} Gobi, differs from Gobioolithus {{in that it}} is larger and has a <b>thicker</b> eggshell with a proportionately smaller mammillary layer. Laevisoolithids, which are also eggs of enantiornithines, are also larger than Gobioolithus, but they have a much <b>thicker</b> mammillary layer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thicker</b> {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its <b>thicker</b> end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the <b>thicker</b> end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the <b>thicker</b> end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

5|$|Gromoboi was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} repeat of , but a design modification for <b>thicker</b> armour and improved engines made that unfeasible. The use of Rossias hull design meant that the ships looked alike.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for <b>thicker</b> armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and <b>thicker</b> armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, <b>thicker</b> armour and a steel hull.|$|E

5|$|Ponies often exhibit <b>thicker</b> manes, tails, {{and overall}} coat. They also have {{proportionally}} shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and <b>thicker</b> necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses {{and also a}} high level of intelligence {{that may or may not}} be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} <b>thicker</b> tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes <b>thicker</b> tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is <b>thicker</b> necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and <b>thicker</b> necked than is the catbird.|$|E

5|$|Later British super-dreadnoughts, principally the , {{dispensed}} with the midships turret, so weight and volume were freed for larger, oil-fired boilers.
