5|$|The tomb of Amenemhat IV has {{not been}} identified. He is {{nonetheless}} often associated with the ruined Southern Mazghuna pyramid. No inscriptions have been found within the pyramid <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> identity of its owner, but its architectural similarity with the second pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara led egyptologists to date the pyramid to the late 12th or early 13th Dynasty. Less likely, Amenemhat IV could have been interred in Amenemhat III's first pyramid in Dashur, since his name has been found on an inscription in the mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> {{meaning of}} the glyphs, Dietrich matched {{traditional}} Polynesian names for stars & astronomical bodies with the pictorial representations of rongorongo.

Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations are identified with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC.

5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage.

The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.

Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{request to}} be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth. Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587. Her entrails, removed as part of the {{embalming}} process, were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle. Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey, in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many of her other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.|$|E

In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system was taken from the Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A radiation detector was to be installed to determine if a satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and gravimetric sensors <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>the</b> mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E

On 29 August, the frigates reached Panka at the easternmost point of Java and the following day captured a merchant ship from Batavia which revealed that the Dutch ships of the line were anchored at Griessie near Surabaya and had deteriorated beyond repair. With their mission complete, the frigates separated to raid Dutch shipping, Psyche sailing west along the coast until Pellew reached the port of Semarang.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col.
