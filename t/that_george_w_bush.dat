5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> was unfit to be president.|$|E

25|$|Democratic {{and liberal}} {{supporters}} of McCain included some elected officials, retired elected officials, journalists, and some supporters of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful primary campaign. According to exit polls on Election Day, 10% {{of those who}} identified themselves as Democrats voted for John McCain, approximately the same percentage of Democratic votes <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> won in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Phyllis Bennis, {{a senior}} analyst with the {{think-tank}} Institute for Policy Studies {{and founder of the}} U.S. Campaign to End Israeli occupation, told Paul Jay of The Real News Network that Clinton's orders of spying on U.N. leaders shows <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> style is still around.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{critics argue}} that America's policy of advocating {{democracy}} may be ineffective and even counterproductive. Zbigniew Brzezinski declared that [...] "he coming to power of Hamas {{is a very good}} example of excessive pressure for democratization" [...] and argued <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> attempts to use democracy as an instrument against terrorism were risky and dangerous.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas Lemann, {{writing in}} New Yorker {{magazine}} in 2015, wrote <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> [...] "description of himself, in the 2000 campaign, as a 'compassionate conservative' was brilliantly vague - liberals heard it as 'I'm {{not all that}} conservative,' and conservatives heard it as 'I'm deeply religious.' It was about him as a person, not a program." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1969 in The Emerging Republican Majority, Kevin Phillips {{argued that}} support from Southern whites and {{growth in the}} South, among other factors, were driving an {{enduring}} Republican electoral realignment. Today, the South is again generally solid in state elections, and mostly solid in presidential contests, but now for the Republicans. Exit polls in 2004 showed <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> led John Kerry 70% to 30% among whites, who constituted 71% of Southern voters.|$|E
25|$|Some of Horowitz's {{accounts}} of U.S. {{colleges and universities}} as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed. For example, Horowitz alleged that a University of Northern Colorado student received a failing grade on a final exam for refusing to write an essay arguing <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> is a war criminal. A spokeswoman for the university said that the test question was not as described by Horowitz {{and that there were}} nonpolitical reasons for the grade, which was not an F.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Lott argued, using a {{regression}} analysis, <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> lost at least 10,000 votes in Florida after the media incorrectly called {{the state for}} Al Gore while voting was still on-going in the more conservative parts of the state. Lott's argument {{is used in the}} influential social science methodology textbook Rethinking Social Inquiry (edited by Henry Brady and David Collier) as an example of poor methodology, and showed how the number of lost Bush votes ranged from 28 to 56.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2006, an ABA {{task force}} under then President Michael S. Greco {{released}} a report <b>that</b> concluded <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> use of [...] "signing statements" [...] violates the Constitution. [...] These are documents attached by the President when signing bills, in which the President states {{that he or she}} will enforce the new law {{only to the extent that}} he or she feels the law conforms to the proper interpretation of the Constitution.|$|R

25|$|In early 1999, Rove {{sold his}} 20-year-old direct-mail business, Karl Rove & Co., which {{provided}} campaign services to candidates, along with Praxis List Company (in whole or part) to Ted Delisi and Todd Olsen, two young political operatives {{who had worked}} on campaigns of some other Rove candidates. Rove helped finance {{the sale of the}} company, which had 11 employees. Selling Karl Rove & Co. was a condition <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> had insisted on before Rove took the job of chief strategist for Bush's presidential bid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, O'Donnell {{suffered}} a staph infection after she accidentally cut the middle finger of her left hand with a knife while cutting a price tag off a fishing pole. The infection incapacitated her for weeks, and nearly resulted in doctors amputating her hand. She later quipped <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> was {{to blame for the}} infection, saying that she was preparing to go on a fishing trip at the time in order to avoid seeing Bush on television during the then-ongoing 2000 Republican National Convention.|$|E
500|$|The Spiegel article accuses von Bülow of {{accepting}} without due scrutiny any fragment or urban legend that fits his suspicions of foul play, and describes {{him as a}} [...] "dreamer". However, {{in his analysis of}} von Bülow's book and the response to it in Germany, Stefan Theil has contended that Der Spiegel is, itself, not unknown to publish speculative or conspiratorial theories, and suggests that the surprisingly strenuous article had deeper motivations than high feelings over journalistic quality. He speculates that the fact that Germans who claimed to believe <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> masterminded 9/11 were not actually demonstrating in the streets was a sign that they simply regarded the conspiracy theorist literature as [...] "political entertainment". With American difficulties in Iraq intensifying, and the possibility of Europe becoming dragged in, politicians and journalists alike were being forced to turn away from the escapism the plots offered.|$|E

5000|$|Caldwell {{offered the}} benediction at Bush's 2001 inauguration. His prayer {{triggered}} controversy; Caldwell prayed in [...] "the name that's above all other names, Jesus the Christ.

Alan Dershowitz wrote, [...] "The plain message conveyed {{by the new}} administration is <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> America is a Christian nation, and that non-Christians are welcome into the tent {{so long as they}} agree to accept their status as a tolerated minority rather than as full equal citizens". Caldwell denies proselytizing, saying that he always prayed in the name of Jesus.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2000 United States Republican Party primaries, it was alleged <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> {{campaign}} used push polling {{against the}} campaign of Senator John McCain. Voters in South Carolina reportedly were asked [...] "Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?" [...] This hypothetical question seemed like a suggestion, although without substance. It was heard by thousands of primary voters.

2500|$|February 2004: Trudeau {{used his}} strip {{to make the}} {{apparently}} genuine offer of USD$10,000 (to the USO in the winner's name) for anyone who could personally confirm <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> was actually present during {{a part of his}} service in the National Guard. Reuters and CNN reported {{by the end of that}} week that despite 1,300 responses, no credible evidence had been offered.

2500|$|After {{it became}} known <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> {{authorized}} NSA wiretaps without warrants, Dean asserted that Bush is [...] "the first President to admit to an impeachable offense". On March 31, 2006, Dean testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during hearings on censuring the president over the issue. Senator Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who sponsored the censure resolution, introduced Dean as a [...] "patriot" [...] who put [...] "rule of law above {{the interests of the}} president." [...] In his testimony, Dean asserted that Richard Nixon covered up Watergate because he believed it was in the interest of national security. This sparked a sharp debate with Republican South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who repeatedly asserted that Nixon authorized the break-in at Democratic headquarters. Dean finally replied, [...] "You're showing you don't know that subject very well." [...] Spectators laughed, and soon the senator was [...] "sputtering mad".|$|E

2500|$|During a BBC {{interview}} in 2001, Harīrī {{was asked by}} Tim Sebastian why he refused to hand over members of Hezbollah that were accused by America of being terrorists. He responded that Hezbollah were the ones protecting Lebanon against the Israeli occupation and called for implementation of passed United Nations resolutions against Israel. He was further accused of making the American coalition {{in the war on}} terrorism worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> had said: [...] "Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists." [...] He replied that he had hoped there would be no consequences, but would deal with them if they arrive. Hariri further said that he opposed the killing of all humans – Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese – and believed in dialogue as a solution. He further went on to say that Syria would have to stay in Lebanon for protection of Lebanon until they are no longer needed and Lebanon asks them to leave.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} offered for Yale's representation in national elections {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating [...] "a laboratory for future leaders," [...] an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: [...] "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [...] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes [...] "an ethos of organized activity" [...] at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: [...] "It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [...] CNN suggests <b>that</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> benefited from preferential admissions policies for the [...] "son and grandson of alumni", and for a [...] "member of a politically influential family". New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.|$|E
