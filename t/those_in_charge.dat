25|$|A state's {{tax system}} often {{reflects}} its communal {{values and the}} values of those in current political power. To create a system of taxation, a state must make choices regarding {{the distribution of the}} tax burden—who will pay taxes and how much they will pay—and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the public does not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.|$|E
25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the fleet and/or mission had {{to be careful not to}} completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E

25|$|A {{sense of}} {{complacency}} fell upon <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was {{considered by the}} Americans to be superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75-mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to a growing awareness that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient Intelligence data processing and forward thinking {{to understand that there}} was an ongoing arms race in tanks and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance {{from the rest of the}} army, concentrated its efforts in tank development mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. By contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British begin development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank would reach service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, a full-blown tank arms race was underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.|$|E

500|$|Another {{concern was}} the health and medical care of the internees. [...] Although medical {{facilities}} were inadequate, the internees counted amongst them about 40 doctors, two dentists, six pharmacists, 100 trained nurses, {{and a large number}} of volunteer auxiliary nurses. Because of this, according to historian G. B. Endacott, no major epidemic occurred. The most common sickness amongst the internees were malaria, malnutrition and its associated diseases, beriberi, and pellagra. [...] The shortage of medical supplies and equipment posed a challenge for <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of medical care, with the lack of soap and disinfectant being a particularly troublesome concern.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{confinement}} to {{a psychiatric}} institution had become the most commonly used method of punishing leaders of the political opposition. In the 1960s and 1970s, the trials of dissenters and their referral for [...] "treatment" [...] to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals under MVD control and oversight came out into the open, and the world learned of a wave of [...] "psychiatric terror" [...] which was flatly denied by <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Serbsky Institute. The bulk of psychiatric repression spans the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. As CPSU General Secretary, from November 1982 to February 1984, Yury Andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic dissafection and continued the Brezhnev Era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the central}} tenets of Elton's thesis {{have since been}} questioned, it has {{consistently}} provided {{the starting point for}} much later work, including that of J. J. Scarisbrick, his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy. For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who [...] "wore regality with a splendid conviction". The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> worthy of blame more than praise. Even among more recent biographers, including David Loades, David Starkey and John Guy, there has ultimately been little consensus {{on the extent to which}} Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea to have}} Scully {{abducted}} originated when Gillian Anderson {{became pregnant}} {{in the middle of}} the first season. While initially upset, <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the show never considered dropping the actress from the show. Ideas such as having Scully give birth to an alien baby were dismissed and ultimately the writers decided to work around the pregnancy by closing the X-Files, separating Mulder and Scully, and eventually having her be abducted. This permitted the producers to have an explanation for Scully's absence (she appears in only two scenes in [...] "Ascension" [...] and not at all in the next episode, [...] "3"). Series creator Chris Carter commented that both the censors and the producers were reluctant on showing Scully in the trunk, but he [...] "fought for that image" [...] as he considered it conveyed the sense of danger to the character. Carter added the scenes of the experiment were meant to be ambiguous on whether Scully was abducted by aliens, the military, or both.|$|E
500|$|When female team members, AOC members, and U.S. Army {{athletes and}} {{officials}} accompanying the team were assigned first-class cabins {{and the balance}} of the male athletes were relegated to troop quarters on lower decks, grumbling from team members quartered belowdecks began almost immediately.

When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River.

500|$|The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition {{was open}} from July2 to August4, 1923. [...] The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in Exposition Park, {{just to the}} east of the brand-new Los Angeles Coliseum, where every evening a {{complimentary}} show for exposition visitors, [...] "Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs", was given. [...] Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge.
