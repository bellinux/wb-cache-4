He also showed that all countable dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in <b>their</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

5|$|The White House Passover Seder was {{an annual}} private dinner {{held at the}} White House on the Jewish holiday of Passover during the {{presidency}} of Barack Obama.

Obama hosted and attended the Seder each year from 2009 to 2016. It was the first Passover Seder to be conducted by a sitting U.S. president in the White House.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using <b>their</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
