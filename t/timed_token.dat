40|$|Abstract. <b>Timed</b> <b>token</b> medium access {{protocols}} {{are widely}} adopted in real-time multiple access networks because of bounded access time. However, <b>timed</b> <b>token</b> protocols inadequately provide periodic commu-nication service, {{although this is}} crucial for hard real-time systems. We propose an algorithm to guarantee periodic communication service on a <b>timed</b> <b>token</b> protocol network. In this algorithm, we allocate band-width to each node so that the summation of each bandwidth allocation is the Target Token Rotation Time (TTRT). Upon receiving the token, a node consumes, at most, pre-allocated time for message transmission, and then passes {{it to the next}} node. If the node cannot consume the allo-cated time, the residual time is allocated to other nodes for non-periodic service using a timer which contains the unused time value and is ap-pended to the token. This algorithm can always guarantee transmission of messages before their deadlines when network utilization is less than 50 %. ...|$|E

First of all, the reservation protocol of IEEE 802. 5 suffers from the lower priority messages that may experience starvation, which is caused by large amounts of enqueued higher-priority packets. To solve that, we propose a protocol that allows the transmission of low priority messages after a high priority message. Secondly, our improved <b>timed</b> <b>token</b> protocol [1] suffers from {{the high number of}} enqueued non real-time messages.
