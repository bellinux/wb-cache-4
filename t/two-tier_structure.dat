30|$|Drawing on {{data from}} the Wage Dynamics Network (see Section  2), Boeri {{provides}} five pieces of {{evidence in support of}} his critique. First, he reports that there {{does not seem to be}} any strong bias in favor of insiders at the plant level as compared with two-tier bargaining. Second, labor costs as a share of total costs are significantly higher in companies practicing two-tier bargaining. Third, <b>two-tier</b> <b>structures</b> provide significantly less performance-related pay than other bargaining forms and especially plant-level bargaining. Fourth, the labor costs of countries with <b>two-tier</b> <b>structures</b> (identified as Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal) have failed to deliver moderation in unit labor cost development vis-à-vis Germany, 2000 – 2013. Finally, he contends that there is little evidence on adjustment mechanisms to suggest that two-tier bargaining can better cope with aggregate shocks. Boeri therefore concludes that <b>two-tier</b> <b>structures</b> do not allow for micro flexibility in wage setting, employment, and hours adjustment that decentralization under two-tier bargaining was supposed to achieve. The problem is that in his consideration of regimes, Boeri again risks putting too much into one basket.|$|R
40|$|Debate over {{labor market}} {{flexibility}} focuses mainly on firing costs, while largely ignoring wage determination {{and the need}} for collective bargaining reform. Most countries affected by the euro debt crisis have <b>two-tier</b> bargaining <b>structures</b> in which plant-level bargaining supplements national or industrywide (multi-employer) agreements, taking the pay agreement established at the multi-employer level as a floor. <b>Two-tier</b> <b>structures</b> were intended to link pay more closely to productivity and to allow wages to adjust downward during economic downturns, while preventing excessive earning dispersion. However, these structures seem to fail precisely on these grounds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Two-tier</b> {{bargaining}} <b>structures,</b> {{in which}} plant-level wage negotiations supplement industry-level wage setting, {{are present in}} a number of EU countries, as unions resist pressures for greater decentralization in wage determination. In principle, these <b>two-tier</b> <b>structures</b> could reconcile macroeconomic stability with a closer link between productivity and pay. Evidence from an ECB firm-level survey suggests, however, that two-tier regimes may end up getting the worst of either fully centralized and fully decentralized systems, as they do not allow incentive schemes to operate downwards, reduce the participation of firms to collective bargaining, and do not seem to improve either microeconomic and macroeconomic adjustment to shocks...|$|R
25|$|In {{some areas}} the {{commission}} {{may wish to}} recommend {{a continuation of the}} existing <b>two-tier</b> <b>structure.</b> But the government expects that to be the exception, and that the result will be a substantial {{increase in the number of}} unitary authorities in both urban and rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Like most English shire counties, Warwickshire has a <b>two-tier</b> <b>structure</b> {{of local}} government.

40|$|In this work, we have {{modified}} the experimental setup for a vapor-solid (VS) process to synthesize Zinc oxide (ZnO) microtubes (MTs) with lengths up to 3 mm during a 90 -min growth period. The critical idea behind this modification is {{to control the}} distribution of Zn vapor along the Si substrates. The morphology evolution of ZnO structures with the increasing reaction time was particularly explored. We found that, within the 90 -min growth period, four different types of ZnO microstructures appeared in this synthesis process: microrods (MRs), short MTs, <b>two-tier</b> <b>structures,</b> and long MTs. Growth mechanisms were proposed to interpret the formation of these structures...|$|R

25|$|In 1974 the {{non-metropolitan county}} of Shropshire was constituted, {{covering}} the entire county. There was a two-tier system of local government, constituting a county council (as the upper tier) and six district councils – Bridgnorth, North Shropshire, Oswestry, Shrewsbury and Atcham, South Shropshire and The Wrekin. In 1998 The Wrekin became a unitary authority, administratively {{separate from the}} county council, and became Telford and Wrekin.

The existing colleges became constituent institutions and the two new member institutions became university colleges. In 2003, both of these colleges became full constituent institutions and in 2004 UWCN received permission from the Privy Council to change {{its name to the}} University of Wales, Newport.|$|E
25|$|Northampton {{was granted}} modern borough status in 1974, {{when it was}} reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district, a {{subdivision}} of its non-metropolitan county (Northamptonshire). The town retains a <b>two-tier</b> <b>structure</b> of local government: the non-metropolitan district of Northampton is administered by both Northampton Borough Council and Northamptonshire County Council, which are both controlled by the Conservative Party. The borough failed to become an unitary authority in the 1990s local government reform and again, in 2011, when the motion was voted down by the council. However, in 2016, the borough council and all seven Northamptonshire MPs proposed to draw up plans for Northampton to become an unitary authority.|$|E

25|$|The <b>two-tier</b> <b>structure</b> {{established}} {{was also}} seen as problematic. In particular, {{the division of}} planning between districts and counties {{was a source of}} friction between the new councils. Thamesdown Borough Council called for a further reform and complete abolition of counties as they felt Wiltshire County Council was unable to respond to the needs of an expanding urban area. Further complaints surrounded the loss of water supply and sewerage powers to regional water authorities created by the Water Act 1973. This was felt to reduce the ability of district councils to plan new housing developments. It was also felt that the boundaries of the metropolitan counties were too tightly drawn, leaving out much of the suburban areas of the conurbations. The leading article in The Times on the day the Act came into effect noted that the new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively.|$|E

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II halted Test cricket {{at the ground}} after this 1935 tour, however domestic cricket continued. 1939 represented {{the last year of}} the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and throughout the war years the Queen's Park Oval hosted several first-class games between Trinidad and either Barbados or British Guiana. International cricket would not return to the ground until 1947 when the MCC returned and played Trinidad twice at the ground in the lead up to the first post-war Test at the Queen's Park Oval on 11 February 1948. England drew with the West Indies—under Clyde Walcott—despite centuries from both West Indian openers. In 1952, the original pavilion was replaced with a <b>two-tier</b> <b>structure</b> as part of an extensive renovation of the ground. In 1953 India toured the West Indies and played the First and Third Tests at the ground. On 17 May 1954, the Oval then hosted England once more and the home team scored 681/8d, which remains the highest team score at the ground. Everton Weekes scored 206 of the runs, the second of two double centuries scored by him at the Oval, following a knock of 207 during the aforementioned tour by India. This was the final match played on the clay surface with matting laid on top. From then on greater effort was made to prepare turf wickets in an attempt to balance batting and bowling at the Oval. More advanced techniques were introduced and a new pitch laid in 1955. Later that year the ground hosted the second Test of an Australian tour. Pakistan came in 1957, followed by England two years later. On 28 January 1960, during the latter tour, England faced the West Indies at the Oval. Batting in front of a 30,000-strong home crowd on the third day, the West Indies fell from 22 for no loss to 98/8. The crowd began to throw bottles onto the pitch, some ran on to the field, and general disorder spread until the game had to be halted. Wisden called the match one of [...] "most dramatic Test matches for many years" [...] and labelled the disorder [...] "unfortunate" [...] and [...] "remarkable", remarking that the situation [...] "became so bad that a riot developed." [...] Officials of the ground and the West Indies team had to apologise to the MCC, as had the Governor of Trinidad, Eric Williams and Learie Constantine. The match resumed and England went on to victory, and took the series 1:0. India returned to the West Indies 1961 and played two further Tests at the Oval.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{proposed}} {{a case for}} a short term CSP peaking system of plants for South Africa in a previous study. A virtual hybrid system including planned Open Cycle Gas Turbines and a spatial-size optimized fleet of CSP plants suggests a number of benefits. A progressive rollout exceeding 3, 000 MW of CSP in 15 years: mitigates cost of capital; incrementally reduces fuel dependency; leads to a local CSP learning rate; adds reserve margin; and leads to a lower system LCOE. In this paper, we study {{the effect that the}} two tier tariff introduced in the Independent Power Producer programme of the Department of Energy has on a 3, 300 MW capacity of CSP plants that is {{proposed a}}s a peaking CSP system. We use the same spatial-temporal analysis approach as conducted in the earlier study. Two scenarios are developed and presented in this study {{in order to determine the}} implications of the <b>two-tier</b> tariff <b>structure.</b> The profitability – Levelized Profit of Energy of the CSP system is used as criteria for validation. Scenario 1 is based on the previous peaking CSP study load profile. It shows that the <b>two-tier</b> tariff <b>structure</b> generates 29  % less revenue than the fixed tariff. Scenario 2 is based on the re-optimized energy delivery from CSP system. This scenario shows that re-optimized energy delivery approach of CSP systemmakes the CSP system more profitable under the <b>two-tier</b> tariff <b>structure...</b>|$|R
