5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda,</b> although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered administrative hierarchy since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E
25|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, Tutsi began {{leaving the country}} to escape the Hutu purges, settling in the four neighbouring countries: Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. These exiles, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial era, were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. They formed armed groups, known as inyenzi (cockroaches), who launched attacks into Rwanda; these were largely unsuccessful, and led to further reprisal killings of Tutsi and further Tutsi exiles. By 1964, more than 300,000 Tutsi had fled, and were forced to remain in exile for the next three decades. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued in Rwanda itself, although the indiscriminate violence against the Tutsi did decrease somewhat following a coup in 1973, which brought President Juvenal Habyarimana to power.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land as a way to gain wood for housing and space for their farming/living areas. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations: one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady from neighboring regions, with incoming groups bearing high genetic similarity to the established ones and integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was not a racial one, but principally a class or caste distinction in which the Tutsi herded cattle while the Hutu farmed the land. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa of Rwanda share a common language and are collectively known as <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>Banyarwanda</b> {{refers to}} Rwandan colonials or {{nationals}} who, {{between the end}} of World War I and 1960 emigrated to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The term is used to distinguish them from Banyamulenge, Rwandans who emigrated in a wave in the 19th century.|$|R

500|$|Rwanda {{has been}} a unified state since pre-colonial times, and the {{population}} is drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda; this contrasts with most modern African states, whose borders were drawn by colonial powers and did not correspond to ethnic boundaries or pre-colonial kingdoms. Within <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> people, there are three separate groups, the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The CIA World Factbook gives estimates that the Hutu made up 84% {{of the population in}} 2009, the Tutsi 15% and Twa 1%. The Twa are a pygmy people who descend from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants, but scholars do not agree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi. Anthropologist Jean Hiernaux contends that the Tutsi are a separate race, with a tendency towards [...] "long and narrow heads, faces and noses"; others, such as Villia Jefremovas, believe there is no discernible physical difference and the categories were not historically rigid. In precolonial Rwanda the Tutsi were the ruling class, from whom the kings and the majority of chiefs were derived, while the Hutu were agriculturalists. The current government discourages the Hutu/Tutsi/Twa distinction, and has removed such classification from identity cards. The 2002 census was the first since 1933 which did not categorise Rwandan population into the three groups.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{stratification}} {{promulgated by}} these ideas, Rwanda {{was still very}} much a unified society. Notwithstanding association with different groups in the sociopolitical hierarchy, the inhabitants all considered themselves part of the same nation, <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda,</b> which means “people of Rwanda.” They spoke the same language, practiced the same cultural traditions, and worshiped the same God. However, the arrival of European colonizers would later exploit group divisions as a means of securing control.|$|E
2500|$|The Tutsi ( [...] ; [...] ), or Abatutsi, are {{an ethnic}} group inhabiting the African Great Lakes region. Historically, they were often {{referred}} to as the Watutsi, Watusi, Wahuma, Wahima or the Wahinda. The Tutsi form a subgroup of <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> and the Barundi peoples, who reside primarily in Rwanda and Burundi, but with significant populations also found in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. They speak Rwanda-Rundi, a group of Bantu languages.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two groups of}} Tutsi in the Congo (DRC). There is the Banyamulenge {{that live in the}} southern tip of South Kivu. They are descendants of migrating Rwandan, Burundian and Tanzanian pastoralists. And secondly there are Tutsi in North Kivu and Kalehe in South Kivu - being part of <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> (Hutu and Tutsi) community. These are not Banyamulenge. Some of these Banyarwanda are descendants of people that lived long before colonial rule in Rutshuru - on what's currently Congolese territory. Others migrated or were [...] "transplanted" [...] by the Belgian colonists from Rutshuru or from Rwanda and mostly settled in Masisi in North Kivu and Kalehe in South Kivu.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Barundi, <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> of South Kivu did {{not have}} their own Native Authority and they were thus reliant upon the local chiefs of the area that they had settled. [...] The pastoralists were located within three territoires: Mwenga, {{inhabited}} by the Lega people; Fizi of the Bembe people; and Uvira, inhabited by the Vira people, Bafuliro and Barundi. The term [...] "Banyamulenge" [...] translates literally as [...] "people of Mulenge", a groupement on the Itombwe plateau. The name [...] "Banyamulenge" [...] was chosen in the early 1970s to avoid being called [...] "Banyarwanda" [...] and seen as foreigners. Ethnic tensions against Tutsi rose {{following the end of}} the colonial period, as well as the 1972 mass killing of Hutu in Burundi. [...] In response the Tutsi appear to have attempted to distance themselves from their ethnicity as Rwandans and lay claim to a territorial identity as residents of Mulenge. [...] As they moved, they continued this practice, so that some Tutsi Banyarwanda in South Kivu call themselves the Banya-tulambo and Banya-minembwe, after the places they were located.|$|E
2500|$|The 1991 Sovereign National Conference (CNS) {{was a sign}} of the {{increasing}} coherence of the anti-Mobutu forces and came as the Congolese Banyarwanda were in a state of heightened tension. [...] Following the beginning of the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, many young Tutsi men in Kivu decided to cross the border to join the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its fight against the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. [...] In response, the Mobutu government implemented Mission d'Identification de Zaïrois au Kivu to identify non-Zairean Banyarwanda, using the end of the Berlin Conference as the division point. [...] Many Banyarwanda whose families had come as colonial labourers were classified as aliens, resulting in yet more youth joining the RPF. [...] The overall effect of the CNS was to strengthen the tendency of [...] "indigenous" [...] Congolese to differentiate between Tutsi from Hutu, and lump together all Tutsi Banyarwanda as [...] "Banyamulenge". [...] It also underlined the fragility of their political position to the Banyamulenge. [...] Within <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> in the Kivus, the Hutu began defining themselves as [...] "indigenous" [...] in comparison to the Tutsis, who were increasingly seen as owing their allegiance to the foreign groups.|$|E
50|$|In August 1998 {{he joined}} the {{political}} board of the RCD and in October 2000, {{in the middle of}} the Second Congo War, he was appointed Governor of North Kivu by the Congolese Rally for Democracy. The appointment of a Hutu Banyarwanda was designed to bring them into an alliance with <b>the</b> predominantly Tutsi <b>Banyarwanda</b> led RCD and their Tutsi Rwandan government backers against the anti-Tutsi Army for the Liberation of Rwanda and indigenous Congolese ethnic groups such as the Hunde, Nyanga and Tembo.|$|R
50|$|After the war, {{the group}} took {{advantage}} of a favourable political environment to expand. Some went south towards Moba port and Kalemi, while others moved onto the Ruzizi plain, where a few became chiefs among the Barundi through gifts of cattle. Still others {{went to work in}} the Bukavu, the provincial capital, or Uvira, a town experiencing a gold rush economic boom. These urban dwellers were able to make a fair living selling meat and milk from their herds to the gold diggers, though the group lacked the political connections to Kinshasa and the large educated class that <b>the</b> North Kivu <b>Banyarwanda</b> possessed.|$|R
50|$|The Hutu set up {{camps in}} eastern Zaire {{from which they}} {{attacked}} both the newly arrived Rwandan Tutsi as well as <b>the</b> Banyamulenge and <b>Banyarwanda.</b> These attacks were the cause of about one hundred deaths a month {{during the first half}} of 1996. Furthermore, the newly arrived militants were intent on returning to power in Rwanda and began launching attacks against the new regime in Kigali, which represented a serious security threat to the infant state. Not only was the Mobutu government incapable of controlling the former génocidaires for previously mentioned reasons but actually supported them in training and supplying for an invasion of Rwanda, forcing Kigali to act.|$|R
2500|$|In {{reaction}} to the apparently growing influence of the Banyamulenge, the majority ethnicities, particularly the Nande and Hunde of North Kivu, focused on dominating the 1977 legislative elections. [...] Once accomplished, they passed the 1981 Citizenship Bill, stating that only people who could prove descent from someone resident in Congo in 1885 would qualify for citizenship. [...] From {{the perspective of the}} [...] "indigenous" [...] ethnicities, such as the Bafuliro, the name [...] "Banyamulenge" [...] was thus a claim to indigeneity in Mulenge, of which the Bafuliro themselves claimed [...] "ownership". [...] However, the bill proved difficult to implement {{by the time of the}} 1985 provincial assembly elections, so the [...] "indigenous" [...] Kivutian majority came up with an ad hoc measure: Banyarwanda were allowed vote in elections but not run for political office. [...] This appeared to aggravate the situation as those Banyarwanda who actually qualified as citizens under the 1981 law found their political rights curtailed. [...] The response of some Banyarwanda, particularly Tutsi, was to smash ballot boxes in protest. Others formed Umoja, an organisation of all Congolese Banyarwanda. [...] However, the increasingly tensions within <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda</b> led to the division of the organisation into two Tutsi and Hutu groups in 1988.|$|E

5000|$|One has to {{understand}} the ambiguity around the Mobutu regime in regards <b>the</b> <b>Banyarwanda.</b> The word Banyarwanda simply means [...] " [...] people of Rwandan origin".

40|$|This thesis redresses a major {{gap in the}} {{literature}} on population movement, especially population studies in Tanzania where there have been few attempts to study and understand the movement of people within and between rural areas. Largely owing to political concerns for rural - urban movements, more money has been made available for scholars to study this phenomenon. As a consequence, explanations of movement have focused on rural poverty, privileged economic based models of analysis, and ignored the dynamic nature of the bulk of the population who live in contiguous rural areas not only of Tanzania but also neighbouring Kenya and Uganda. This urban bias is reinforced by a methodological unwillingness to study population movements that do not fit this economic rationale. I argue that to understand population movement in and between rural areas, attention needs to be refocused on non-economic motives, give more emphasis to cultural continuity and to understanding the meanings of movement as the people engaged in it see it for themselves. In this study, I use an ethnographic approach to explore the movement of people in Karagwe rural district. This district receives movers from Ankole (Southern Uganda) and Rwanda inspired by cultural considerations that become understood by listening and seeing the movement in their own worldview. <b>The</b> Banyankole and <b>Banyarwanda</b> perceive movement as a "homeward journey" best described by the metaphor of 'omuka/oweitu' (home to home) as people move within their cultural territory to live with relatives of consanguinity, affinity and African blood pacts. The network of these relationships evolved out of historical movements, intermarriages, norms and customs created and shared over many years to give a sense of oneness or common identity in a shared cultural space. During the field study in 2000, these homeward movements revealed in the family life histories were part of a strategy to cement the bonds of kinship and a return to the roots/ ancestral homes. This understanding and interpretation of movement in a constructed cultural space is revealed through listening to the life histories of family movement and experiences as well as the language used to express the event of movement. In this cultural space where they negotiate a living, long-term movement is perceived, as 'okutaha' (to go home) and 'okutura' (to settle or stay) while short-term movements are captured by the metaphors that revolve around the theme of 'visits'. The origin and destination points for these movements are "home" meaning a place where one resides or where one is born. In both meanings the mover has relatives of kin and is in a familiar environment/cultural territory. Movement is one that leads a person outside the created cultural space often disassociated with and considered as disappearing into the unknown. This suggests that intra-rural and inter-rural movements are culturally inspired and are strategies to maintain and activate relationship networks between people as described in a language and the worldview of the movers - the world they live in...|$|R
