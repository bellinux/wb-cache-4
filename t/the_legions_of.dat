5|$|After Marius, {{the legions}} were drawn largely from {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. <b>The</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the late Republic remained, unlike <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Crassus, and the realization that <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E

5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak about the Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by the brilliance of the banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Syria, however, had proclaimed Pescennius Niger emperor.

25|$|Foreign invasions (Assyrians, Greeks, Romans and Arabs) were {{to bring}} an end to the great dynastic era of Egypt. However the prowess of the Sudanic {{infantry}} (variously known in writings as 'Kushites', 'Ethiopians', 'Nubians', 'Napthans' or 'Meroeites'), still made a distinctive mark in the region, and beyond, especially the archers. Several strong polities arose in the southern Nile Valley after the decline of the pharaonic period, ushering in the eras of Kush, Christian Nubia and other smaller groupings. Besides a process of internal conflict, fighting men from this region were to clash with several major external enemies - <b>the</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> Rome, the armies of Persia, and the forces of Islam.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>legions</b> <b>of</b> {{the late}} Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate {{by saying that}} in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (scutum).|$|E

When the guardian of balance, Ariel, dies at the hands of a mysterious, malevolent entity, her lover Nupraptor the Mentalist turns his powers against his fellow Circle members, tainting the incumbent guardians with irrevocable madness and leaving the Pillars corrupt. To restore balance to Nosgoth, Kain must overcome the Legions and kill the insane sorcerers; as each Circle member is purged and their token returned, their respective Pillar is cleansed, and when he heals all nine Pillars, replacement guardians can be born.|$|E
