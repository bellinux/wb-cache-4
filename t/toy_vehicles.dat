5|$|Corgi International Limited made 5-inch {{action figures}} and gadgets (such as a {{voice-activated}} briefcase), {{as well as}} its traditional die-cast <b>toy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.|$|E
25|$|Changing fashions in the toy industry, {{international}} {{competition and the}} switch to cheap labour in lower wage countries meant that the days of British-made <b>toy</b> <b>vehicles</b> like Dinky Toys were numbered. After attempts at simplifying the products {{as a means of}} saving costs, the famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool finally closed its doors in November 1979. By comparison, Corgi Toys managed to struggle on until 1983. Matchbox was taken over by Universal International of Hong Kong in 1982 (McGimpsey & Orr 1989, p.28). Thus ended the era when UK-made die-cast toy models were dominant.|$|E
25|$|Children {{have played}} with {{miniature}} versions of vehicles since ancient times, with toy two-wheeled carts being depicted on ancient Greek vases. Wind-up toys have {{also played a}} part in the advancement of <b>toy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Modern equivalents include toy cars such as those produced by Matchbox or Hot Wheels, miniature aircraft, toy boats, military vehicles, and trains. Examples of the latter range from wooden sets for younger children such as BRIO to more complicated realistic train models like those produced by Lionel, Doepke and Hornby. Larger die-cast vehicles, 1:18 scale, have become popular toys; these vehicles are produced with a great attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|No toys were {{produced}} {{to tie in}} with The Last Crusade in 1989, but in 1993 Horizon released highly detailed vinyl model kits of Indiana and Henry Jones, while in 1995 Micro Machines produced a set of ten die-cast <b>toy</b> <b>vehicles</b> from all three films. Micro Machines also considered a mini. playset, but this was never made available. In 1999, Toys McCoy released a Japanese-market-only limited edition 12-inch figure of Indiana and his horse from Raiders. In 2001, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts sold new, exclusive action figures and model vehicles, and a second wave followed in August 2003. This included G.I. Joe versions of Jones, including an African-American styled toy, to honor the black performers at their stunt shows.|$|E

50|$|A model <b>vehicle</b> or <b>toy</b> <b>vehicle</b> is a {{miniature}} representation of an automobile. Other miniature motor vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or even ATVs, etc. are often {{included in this}} general category. Because many miniature vehicles were originally aimed at children as playthings, there is no precise difference between a model car and a toy car, yet the word 'model' implies either assembly required or the accurate rendering of an actual vehicle at smaller scale. The kit building hobby became popular through the 1950s, while the collecting of miniatures by adults started to pick up momentum around 1970. Precision-detailed miniatures made specifically for adults are {{a significant part of}} the market since the mid-1980s (Gibson 1970, p. 9; Harvey 1974; Johnson 1998, p. 5).|$|R
