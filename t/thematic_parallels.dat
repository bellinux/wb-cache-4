500|$|Reviewer Ian Watson {{states that}} the Athshean forest itself {{is a metaphor for}} {{consciousness}} in the novel. The Terrans, distanced from their own tangled subconscious, are afraid of the forest, and seek to tear it down. The Athsheans, in contrast, are integrated with it at a subconscious level. The entire forest is also seen as a collective Athshean consciousness. Although the forest in The Word for World is Forest is not actually sentient, Le Guin explores the idea of a sentient forest further in the short story [...] "Vaster than Empires and More Slow", which shares many <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> with the former.|$|E

Literary {{connections}} {{have also}} been suggested: Philip French of the Guardian has perceived <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> with Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (1939). Many critics have also suggested that the film derives in part from A. E. van Vogt's The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950), particularly its stories [...] "The Black Destroyer", in which a cat-like alien infiltrates the ship and hunts the crew; and [...] "Discord in Scarlet", in which an alien implants parasitic eggs inside crew members which then hatch and eat their way out. O'Bannon, however, denies that this was a source of his inspiration for Alien story. Van Vogt in fact initiated a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox over the similarities, but Fox settled out of court.|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of horror works was highlighted by critics and Brooker himself. Lambie found {{aspects of the}} forest scene reminiscent of 1970s exploitation films. He also felt there are several visual and <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> to The Wicker Man and Kill List. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy affirmed it is reminiscent of zombies and slasher films [...] "and even has that unsettling Wicker Man feel with its notion of 'society gone wrong'." [...] Brooker commented it is indeed [...] "a Wicker Man-style horror", and noted that someone who likes the original Wicker Man would appreciate [...] "White Bear" [...] very much. Because they have similar concepts, 28 Days Later and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were also mentioned by reviewers as possible influences. Paul Brian McCoy of Comics Bulletin stated it [...] "recalls any number of zombie apocalypse dramas, including Brooker's own Dead Set at times" [...] and The Signal. While Brooker said the hunters' design {{was inspired by the}} horror video game Manhunt, McCoy felt its opening echoed another game, Resident Evil.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{parallels}} are perhaps with the Biblical and post-Biblical narrative of John the Baptist. Here we find {{not only a}} beheading, but a problematic marriage (with suggestions of incest rather than exogamy), defiant denunciation of tyranny, a centrally-important young woman and presentation of the head to a third party. Here, however, {{the threat to the}} faith community seems to come from inside. The <b>thematic</b> <b>parallel,</b> nevertheless, was strong enough for the builders to back St Valerie's shrine in St Michel des Lions with a fine stained glass window depicting John the Baptist.|$|R

These three songs, Leng continues, constitute a cycle of [...] "sheer unhappiness" [...] in the singer's life that was only alleviated by the positive presence of Arias, who, following their marriage in 1978, remained Harrison's life partner until his death in November 2001. Leng also compares [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] to the posthumously released [...] "Stuck Inside a Cloud", which he terms the lyrical [...] "blood brother" [...] to this 1975 song, due to its [...] "harrowing" [...] description of the cancer that would claim Harrison's life.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{began writing}} in January 1973, [...] "eight hours a day, {{five days a}} week", by taking small notes, inventing odd names and {{assigning}} them possible characterizations. Lucas would discard many of these {{by the time the}} final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels. He revived others decades later when he wrote his prequel trilogy. He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled Journal of the Whills, which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a [...] "Jedi-Bendu" [...] space commando by the legendary Mace Windy. Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> with Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress.|$|E
40|$|Shakespeare's Othello, a play {{written on}} the cusp of the modern era, is manifestly {{concerned}} with the destructive consequences of racial intolerance. This <b>thematic</b> <b>parallel</b> could provide grounds for a reading of the play informed by Horkheimer and Adorno’s Dialectic of Enlightenment. However, if one attends to the concerns about hypostatization and its relationship to instrumental reason tacit in the play, a more nuanced reading, which takes into account not only what the Dialectic can tell us about the play, but also how the play presages the Dialectic, is possible; it is this reading that I will here undertake and that will hopefully allow us to penetrate the reasons behind the intolerance to that which does not fit into pre-conceived categories, of which Othello and Desdemona—not to mention the exiled Horkheimer and Adorno—were victims...|$|R
40|$|The Romantic novelist Mary Robinson had {{a life-long}} sentimental {{attachment}} to Marie Antoinette, transforming {{her into a}} persecuted heroine whose story paralleled Robinson's own. What has been overlooked in the critical literature is her similar engagement with the obscure Angevin princess, Eleanor of Brittany, in her third novel Angelina (1796). The inset history of Eleanor functions as a <b>thematic</b> <b>parallel</b> to the romantic travails of Sophia Clarendon, who struggles to avoid a forced marriage. Eleanor also functions as {{a means by which}} Robinson can think through ideas relating to tyranny and the need for liberal reform. Eleanor, a long-term prisoner of King John, becomes the muse through which Robinson invites the reader to contemplate a rejuvenated social order in which merit is valued above arbitrary privilege.

2500|$|In 1971, Universal Studios made a {{contract}} for George Lucas to direct two films. In 1973, American Graffiti was completed, and released to critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Original Screenplay for George Lucas. Months later, Lucas started work on his second film, by starting the script draft, The Journal of the Whills told {{the tale of the}} training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a [...] "Jedi-Bendu" [...] space commando by the legendary Mace Windy. After Universal rejected the film, 20th Century Fox decided to invest on it. On April 17, 1973, Lucas felt frustrated about his story being too difficult to understand, so he began writing a 13-page script with <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> to Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, this draft was renamed The Star Wars. By 1974, he had expanded the script into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller.

5000|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker says Hemingway {{captured}} {{the theme of}} [...] "the three ages of man," [...] and in writing the book he finally objectified his own youthful traumatic war experiences. [...] Baker sees a <b>thematic</b> <b>parallel</b> between Thomas Mann's Death in Venice and Across the River and into the Trees, presented {{in a series of}} commonalities and differences. Death in Venice is set in the summer on Venice's Lido; Hemingway puts Cantwell in Venice in the winter. Mann's protagonist is a writer; Hemingway's a soldier. Both face death, and in the face of death seek solace in a much younger character. Cantwell reminisces about the past while Renata (an 18-year-old countess with whom Cantwell spends the last days of his life) lives in the present. Cantwell says that [...] "Every day is a new and fine illusion" [...] where a kernel of truth can be found. Cantwell is a character in opposition: a tough soldier yet a tender friend and lover. The two Cantwells at times overlap and bleed into one another. Hemingway added yet another layer in the characterization: 50-year-old Cantwell in his dying day is [...] "in an intense state of awareness" [...] of his younger self of 1918 to the point that meld - yet retain the differences wrought by time.|$|R

50|$|Thorns {{has several}} <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels</b> with Silverberg's {{contemporaneous}} novel The Man in the Maze.

The approximation between these two works permits us, despite their differences – one, a video work, the other, a literary text, - explore issues associated with the instant, dead, memory, and the relations inscribing the factual and the fictional, writing and image, as well as conceive new forms of temporality proceeding through the fragmentation and the interruption of the univocal diegetic structures. We try to suggest, by this mean, the privilege of processes related with editing and cut, assessing the emergence of  points and singular instants which, being normally attached to the consideration of the still image, ultimately participate and profusely determine the reconstitution and reevaluation of the filmic structure and the image in motion...|$|R

40|$|While it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that Un Coup de dés served Huidobro directly as a formal, thematic and linguistic model for Altazor, the essential connection between the two poems lies in a parallel effort to repeat the act of the original Creation.

The fall, destruction and resurrection of Adam and Orpheus is simultaneously the fall, destruction and resurrection of language. Huidobro has taken up the challenge of Mallarmé to spin out of nothingness the abyss, the primordial sea of potential in which all reality is dissolved, another constellation/poem, which is at once the same and unique, another configuration of the eternal Poem: a parallel Orphic explanation of the earth.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} a {{political}} risk analysis using two indigenous models to review foreign direct investment in South Africa. Focus is placed on South Africa as it positions itself favourably for foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and participates actively in the global economy. While {{there have been numerous}} studies on the determinants of FDI flows to developing countries, {{there is a lack of}} research surrounding the political dynamics and the impact this has on FDI. This is surprising as an absence of a clear understanding of how political risk analysis is approached may result in understating corporate risk strategies, foregoing opportunities, or the prospects of international capital flows that would otherwise add towards the growth of world trade. In spite of the recommendations and forecasts made, commercial political risk models do not explain or fully capture the politics behind risk analysis. The result is that they are not able to convey nuanced information that is likely to be captured in an indigenous model of political risk. In South Africa Albert Venter (2005) set out to develop a locally informed approach towards the study of political risk analysis. The Venter (2005) model draws on the sterling findings of Howell and Chaddick (1994) to reconfigure a model for political risk analyses and moreover, to assemble a model that is responsive to the South African context. In addition, although not branded as a political risk analysis model, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) forms an indigenous approach towards assessing elements of political risk through a self-appraisal mechanism designed to benchmark governance and accelerate socio-economic development. Focus is placed on findings made on the state of South Africa based on its four <b>thematic</b> areas. <b>Parallels</b> will be made based on the results from the Venter (2005) model, and those obtained from the APRM.

5000|$|The final {{lines of}} the poem differ {{somewhat}} from the preceding stanzas, and arguably even move beyond the strict theme of prayer: 'To the world you might be one person, But to one person you {{just might be the}} world.' In terms of broader <b>thematic</b> <b>parallels,</b> such a play on the words 'one person' and 'world' can be compared with the notion of microcosm in universality, which also expresses something of the cultural contribution of, and human interest in, the small nation of Nauru.

40|$|Revival: Memories, Identities, Utopias {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of revivalism in art, architecture and design from the nineteenth century to the present. Essays from leading scholars investigate the meanings and impacts of revivalism across {{a wide array of}} global contexts. The book?s three sections are prefaced by critical interventions, which consider the significance of ?nostalgia?, ?anachronism? and ?historicism? as philosophical, cultural, and artistic categories that are as productive as they are problematic. A <b>thematic</b> framework invites <b>parallels</b> between apparently disparate projects, such as resurgences of techniques or materials, medievialism, utopian futurism, empire and style, and the persistence of ?neo? {{in the midst of an}} ever-urgent quest for originality. Revivalism?s political, religious and economic dimensions are considered from a variety of perspectives, and the differing registers of revivalism are foregrounded in innovative and sophisticated ways. Revival: Memories, Identities, Utopias is the first book to consider these complex processes of historical layering and the stimulating dialogues struck up between materials, objects and ideas that take place across periods and places, often with surprising and controversial results. From Neo-Victorian typography and tattooing to idyllic urban planning and divine revelations, the cultural heft of revivalism is revealed as a constant and paradoxical companion of modernity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four main sections:  The Text: a new edition and translation of the medieval Irish text known as Fingala Chlainne Tanntail (FCT), ‘The Kinslayings {{of the family of}} Tantalus’, which contains versions of several Classical narratives concerning Tantalus and his descendants down to Orestes. The Classical Context: a comparative analysis between the retrospective contents of FCT and analogues from the Classical tradition from the time of Homer until the approximate date of composition of FCT. The Medieval Irish Context: an assessment of the material in FCT which is unique to it among accounts of the Classical narratives which the text relates.   This unique material is both compared with examples found within the wider corpus of medieval Irish literature and examined from a <b>thematic</b> perspective. A <b>Parallel</b> Text to FCT : FCT is found in two manuscripts alongside several other vernacular works dealing with Classical material. The sources for several of these texts are, {{as in the case of}} FCT, unknown.   Only one, Merugud Uilix meic Leirtis, ‘The Wandering of Ulysses son of Laertes’ (an abridged, and idiosyncratic, version of part of the narrative of Homer’s Odyssey) is found in both manuscripts, which also contain FCT.   The content of Merugud Uilix meic Leirtis is compared to its analogues found in the Classical tradition, with reference to the findings in (ii) in relation to FCT. The thesis concludes by drawing together the findings of all four sections, with particular reference to the findings in (ii) concerning both the most likely types of source for the Classical material contained in FCT, and its unique content and apparent thematic preoccupations as discussed in (iii).   These results are placed in the context of those found in (iv) in relation to Merugud Uilix meic Leirtis.

40|$|The {{literature}} of James K. Baxter features many <b>thematic</b> and stylistic <b>parallels</b> {{with that of}} his father, Archibald. The material used in this thesis, most of which is previously unpublished, will illustrate how this is apparent from the outset of James's literary career. Substantial use is also made of a personal interview conducted with James's brother, Terence. Archie's unpublished work contains many expressions of his beliefs and principles, and attention to these is essential {{in order to achieve}} a better understanding, not only of his own literature, but also to appreciate how these beliefs came to be realised in James's verse from a very early period. Archie's poetry, traditionally ignored by critical opinion, will be discussed in some detail, particularly in relation to theme and style. Much of his verse is Romantic, while the remainder is often an expression of pacifist or socialist beliefs. A significant amount of James's early verse reiterates these beliefs also, as the World War II period had a dramatic effect on him and coincided with the beginning of his literary career. Archie's unpublished, factually based novel is important to this discussion as it is evidence that a tradition of ancestral mythology was well established by previous Baxter generations. Therefore James, rather than beginning this mythology himself, as has been thought, actually had a substantial body of myth and legend at his disposal should he choose to use it His posthumously published novel, Horse, is not only indebted to this legacy, but also illustrates his conscious desire to make himself a part of that same mythology. The extent and obvious nature of many literary parallels and similarities in work of Archie and James highlight the fact that, although much of Archie's material remains unpublished, it is a useful source for developing a greater understanding of James's literature...|$|R
