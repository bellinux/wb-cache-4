40|$|Abstract — The finite {{frequency}} bandwidth of ultrasonic transducer {{is the most}} significant factor that limits the time resolution of the ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) signals. Consequently, in order to remove the <b>transducer</b> <b>effect</b> from the received signal and minimize the effects of noise, deconvolution techniques should be applied. In this study we apply a model-based deconvolution approach on received signals from thin layer sheets to estimate the time of arrival (TOA) of the echoes and subsequently obtain an accurate estimation of thickness. In this approach the transducer wavelet is modeled by some Gaussian echoes as preliminary stage and then deconvolution of superimposed echoes is carried out using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm as a parameter estimation problem. A simulation study was performed to assess the merit of this algorithm in separating the superimposed echoes and finally the algorithm was applied on experimental data to estimate the reflectivity accurately for thickness measurement.

40|$|In {{materials}} characterization, a material’s {{transfer function}} is calculated from experimental data. Sometimes, {{the transfer function}} of the measurement device, such as an ultrasonic transducer, must be known for this calculation. One of the common methods of obtaining a material transfer function is to measure an elastic waveform before and after it propagates through a material. Then, the transfer function is calculated by deconvolving the two waveforms. We illustrate this process in Fig. 1, where two transducers are placed with a section of plate material between them. The material transfer function is measured by deconvolving the signal at the first transducer from the signal at the second identical transducer. Ideally, this deconvolution would remove the <b>transducer</b> <b>effects.</b> Likewise, if the transducers were placed at the same location (d= 0), the transfer function of one transducer could be calculated using a reference transducer...|$|R
40|$|In modal testing, the {{measured}} frequency response functions (FRFs) are often affected by <b>transducer</b> mass <b>effects.</b> Especially when multiple sensors are employed, <b>transducers</b> mass <b>effects</b> are more significant. This paper deals with removing sensors mass effects from {{the measured}} FRFs in hammer impact testing. The proposed method offers some advantages over the available techniques in that extra FRFs measurements with different configurations are not required during the correction process. Firstly, correction method for single accelerometer case is discussed. Further, general correction formulation for multiple accelerometers case is derived. Then, validations of the proposed method are demonstrated using simulated and experimental data. It shows good effectiveness in experimental validation for single accelerometer case. Numerical simulation also demonstrates a good performance for multiple accelerometers case. However, further simulations with noisy-polluted data show that the accuracy of correction results will be affected to some extent by the noise. It is suggested that the measured FRFs be preprocessed using the curve-fitting procedure or noise reduction processing before applying the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Finite {{amplitude}} {{sound propagation}} undergoes nonlinear distortion due to continuous path {{interaction with the}} propagation medium. This distortion tends to defocus the beam causing significant lateral and contrast resolution degradation. Fundamental understanding of this interaction requires development of computational models that accurately predict the nonlinear interaction - development of media-borne harmonics - as well as produce an ultrasound image - introduction of <b>transducer</b> <b>effects,</b> interface transitions, and innovative image processing to extract harmonics. Most computational models of ultrasound propagation assume axial symmetry for computational expediency. Two notable exceptions are the K-Z-K and NLP models. A new endto- end model, NUPROP, is introduced that also incorporates non-axially symmetric geometries and simplified transducer responses to accurately predict ultrasound RF signals for image reconstruction. Nonlinearities are modeled using either the Fubini solution or Burgers 2 ̆ 7 Equation coupled with angular spectrum propagation or Lommel formulation, appropriately masked by the transducer frequency response. Comparative analyses are performed on NUPROP results with high correlation with the literature.

AOX-poly(nBA-NAS) microspheres were deposited on a pH transducer {{made from a}} layer of photocured and self-plasticized polyacrylate membrane with an entrapped pH ionophore coated on a Ag/AgCl screen printed electrode (SPE). Oxidation of formaldehyde by the immobilized AOX resulted {{in the production of}} protons, which can be determined via the pH <b>transducer.</b> <b>Effects</b> of buffer concentrations, pH and different amount of immobilization matrix towards the biosensor’s analytical performance were investigated.

40|$|Advanced {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive evaluation}} techniques require well characterized transducers. This need may arise, for example, because modern, cost-efficient fabrication procedures necessitate high reliability inspection through non-planar surfaces {{and for which}} careful control of the beam pattern in needed. An {{example of this is}} the developing procedure for inspection of titanium billet material for subtle flaws, such as hard-alpha inclusions [1]. Large aperture, bicylindrical focusing transducers are being developed, and characterization procedures are also being formulated for that activity. Methods are required to relate design parameters, such as crystal and lens shape, to the ultrasonic fields that will be generated in the billet. Advanced signal processing methods, such as characterization of noise due to ultrasonic scattering from grains, require precise knowledge of probe characteristics, as well. For example, model-based approaches to calculating a grain scattering “figure of merit” [2] require the ability to deconvolve <b>transducer</b> <b>effects</b> from measured noise signals. Knowledge of transducer characteristics is also essential for the application of ultrasonic measurement models [3, 4] to the prediction of flaw signal amplitudes as measured through curved component surfaces and in a variety of materials.

This thesis {{describes the}} design of low frequency, high power capability class-I flextensional, otherwise known as the barrel-stave, flextensional transducer. Piezoelectric ceramic rings are inserted inside the shell. Under an electric drive, ceramic rings vibrate in the thickness mode in the longitudinal axis. The longitudinal vibration of the rings is transmitted to the shell and converted into a flexural motion. Low amplitude displacements on its axis create high total displacement on the shell, acting as a mechanical transformer.

Critical analysis of the transducer is performed using finite element modeling (FEM).

In that study, the angular distribution of the scattered acoustic field from an insonifying source {{directly related to the}} distribution of surface fibrillatory changes. In the current study, we demonstrate a more sensitive method to quantify surface roughness, the effect of global surface curvature in estimating surface roughness and the utility of using focused transducers in circumventing this potential problem for in vivo work. Phantoms composed of acrylic rods with and without sandpaper grit (about 15 to 72 [mu], mean particle size) applied to the surface were scanned. A more robust angular scattering technique to measure the angle dependent data was employed, in which the integrated squared pressure amplitude over a finite time window (mean power) was measured as a function of incident acoustic angle for varying surface roughnesses and radii of curvature. We show that the potential dynamic range for making roughness discriminations diminishes with decreasing radius of curvature of the acrylic rod phantoms using an unfocused <b>transducer.</b> This <b>effect</b> is minimized with use of a focused <b>transducer.</b> Roughness <b>effects</b> are most evident at sufficiently large angles where incoherent scattering dominates.

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse-echo method}} aims {{to use the}} measured echo-signals to characterize defects — their location, orientation and size. The solution of this inverse problem requires the availability of good models of the forward problem, that is an understanding of radiation and reception of ultrasonic waves by realistic transducers {{as well as of}} the processes of scattering by arbitrary defects. This in itself is very complicated and requires simplifications and approximations. This paper aims to extend a previous model dealing with the case of propagation in fluids [1, 2]. Modeling the actual propagation in solids as a propagation in fluids is a simplification commonly made in the considerable literature. A solution for solids requires account to be taken of both compression and shear waves. Since the two types of wave propagate with different velocities, a solution for fluids is acceptable if the defect is sufficiently distant from the transducer, that is, if the arrival-times of the respective echoes are well separated in time. When this condition is not fulfilled, compression and shear waves as well as their mode-conversion at interfaces must be considered. The earlier solution for fluids has shown the paramount importance of <b>transducer</b> diffraction <b>effects</b> in the echo-forming mechanism. The solution explicitly used the impulse-response theory for calculating <b>transducer</b> diffraction <b>effects</b> both in radiation and reception. The first step to extend the work to solids was to dispose of a solution for the transient radiation in a solid medium. Such a solution has been developed. It is based on the approximation that Rayleigh and head waves contributions generated by the transducer are negligible at field-points of interest [3, 4], i. e., the solution is suitable at field-points not too close to the interface where the transducer radiates. In using this solution for modeling the behavior of the transducer both in radiation and reception, the complete solution for radiation, scattering and reception will not apply for modeling echo-responses from defects close to or at the interface, e. g., surface breaking cracks.
