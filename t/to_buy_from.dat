Hollyer sold the reproductions both via printsellers around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2017, Milan {{confirmed}} the loan signing of Ocampos {{for the remainder}} of the season, with Genoa retaining the option <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> Marseille at the end of the loan spell. He was signed as a replacement for Frenchman M'Baye Niang who had moved on loan to Premier League side Watford. Ocampos made his debut for the club on 5 February, coming on as a late second-half substitute for Andrea Bertolacci in a 1–0 defeat to Sampdoria. He featured sporadically for the club, however, and at the end of the season returned to Marseille having played 29 matches and scored 3 goals across all competitions during his stints with Genoa and Milan.|$|E

5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The Free State began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the Free State launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the Free State authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the Free State to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

40|$|The key {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to address the gaps by building a theoretically based conceptual model to examine the influence of consumer regiocentrism and its moderators, and community involvement on consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> products <b>from</b> their own region. A mail survey of 2000 consumers from the Western Australian metropolitan area, supported four of the five proposed hypotheses. The results revealed that consumer regiocentric tendencies and community involvement positively influenced consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> products <b>from</b> their own region. Community involvement was also found to positively influence consumer regiocentric tendencies. Although perceived product necessity moderated the relationship between consumer regiocentrism and consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> products <b>from</b> their own region, perceived economic/personal threat did not moderate the relationship between consumer regiocentrism and consumers 2 ̆ 7 willingness <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> products <b>from</b> their own region.

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E

25|$|Emerson Bainbridge died in 1892 and {{his sons}} took over the business. In that same year, Bainbridge's {{employed}} a staff of 600 in Newcastle, and the store had 11,705 square yards of floor space. In 1897 the business became a private limited company. During the Depression, which hit the Newcastle area badly, the store introduced agents who operated in less prosperous areas, collecting payments in weekly instalments. This meant that people on low incomes could continue <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> the shop and it kept the Bainbridge name and reputation known in areas where otherwise it might have faded away.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was often}} shipped {{out to the}} troops, but {{shortages}} owing to problems with shipping became a common occurrence, and it was therefore much easier to live off the land on which they were stationed, or <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> locals. Vegetables were also grown and livestock procured to help feed the troops, but there were many reports of soldiers sickening {{due to a lack}} of proper nourishment. The level to which troops were adequately fed varied, being dependent on the nature of the terrain the army was operating in and on the skill of their senior commanders.|$|E

However, the Rock brothers underestimated the newcomers. Eventually, the elder brother, John Rock, agreed to cooperate, but younger brother Joe refused. One night the Noe-Schultz gang kidnapped him. They beat him and hung him by his thumbs from a meat hook and then allegedly wrapped a gauze bandage smeared with discharge from a gonorrhea infection over his eyes. His family reportedly paid $35,000 and he was released. Shortly after his return, he went blind. From then on, the Noe-Schultz gang met little opposition as they expanded to control the beer supply for the entire Bronx.|$|E

25|$|Investors may not {{be members}} of stock exchanges. Rather they must buy and sell {{securities}} through broker-dealers which are registered with the appropriate regulatory body for that purpose. In accepting investors as clients, broker-dealers take on the risks of their clients {{not being able to}} meet their financial obligations. Hence retail (individual) investors generally are required to keep their investment assets in custody with the broker-dealer through which they buy and sell securities. A broker-dealer would normally not accept an order <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> a retail clients unless there is sufficient cash on deposit with the broker-dealer {{to cover the cost of}} the order, nor sell unless the client already has the security in the broker-dealer's custody.|$|E
25|$|Sales of {{additional}} ICTS systems went nowhere, {{and the government}} began to worry about UTDC's continued successes. The government pushed any potential deployment <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> UTDC, but with only one product, and that product having many problems in Toronto, there was little interest from other cities. At the same time, the buy-UTDC clause locked Hawker Siddeley Canada out of many local projects, and they had formerly been a major supplier in the local market. The solution was to form a 50-50 combined company, Can-Car Rail, who marketed the combined product line. Hawker {{had a number of}} successful products, notably their Bombardier BiLevel Coach, and as these other products were selling well through this period, interest in actively selling ICTS waned.|$|E
25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000. Recorded coltan production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999 to 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and coltan was the country's biggest single export earner in 2001. At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>from</b> the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E
