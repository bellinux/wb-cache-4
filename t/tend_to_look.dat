5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E
25|$|One {{common theme}} in much {{traditional}} African architecture {{is the use}} of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.|$|E
25|$|The community, {{while in}} theory {{should be more}} liberal than other {{communities}} in Western and Southern Asia, has some paternal aspects that clash with liberal western youth values. A number of second generation have commented on how their first generation parents <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down on many elements of western youth culture (binge drinking, illegal drugs, promiscuity, etc.), and issues such as mental illness, homophobia, and misogyny have often received minor vocal opposition from first generation Sri Lankans.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the former}} town's {{political}} ties to Nakatsu City, it is geographically closer to Hita City to its west. It also <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> bordering Fukuoka Prefecture {{more than to}} the distant prefectural capital of Oita City.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{difference}} between program assurance and program quality management or audit, is that program assurance <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{the potential impact}} of the program's approach.|$|R
5000|$|Pickle (voiced by Nat Faxon) is a green monster truck who is Crusher's sidekick despite Crusher's {{indifference}} towards him. He <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> on {{the brighter}} {{side of things}} and is quite goofy.|$|R
25|$|A {{low-cost}} denture {{starts at}} about $300–$500 per denture, or $600–$1,000 {{for a complete}} set of upper and lower dentures. These tend to be cold cured dentures, which are considered temporary because of the lower quality materials and streamlined processing methods used in their manufacture. In many cases, there is no opportunity to try them on for fit before they are finished. They also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> artificial and not as natural as higher quality, higher priced dentures.|$|E
25|$|Shaiva {{approaches}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon Parvati as the Shiva's submissive and obedient wife. However, Shaktas {{focus on}} Parvati's equality or even superiority to her consort. The {{story of the}} birth of the ten Mahavidyas (Wisdom Goddesses) of Shakta Tantrism. This event occurs while Shiva is living with Parvati in her father's house. Following an argument, he attempts to walk out on her. Her rage at Shiva's attempt to walk out, manifests in the form of ten terrifying goddesses who block Shiva's every exit.|$|E
25|$|Most {{contemporary}} {{scholars of}} antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and most biblical scholars and classical historians see {{the theories of}} his nonexistence as effectively refuted. There {{is no indication that}} writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus. However, there is widespread disagreement among scholars on the details of the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings. Scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus, and historians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon supernatural or miraculous claims about Jesus as questions of faith, rather than historical fact.|$|E
50|$|While {{same-sex}} {{sexual activity}} between consenting adults in private had been legal since 1887, {{there were no}} civil rights laws designed to protect LGBT people, and public opinion <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down upon LGBT people.|$|R
50|$|Rugby came to Morocco in {{the early}} 20th century, mainly by the French who {{occupied}} the country. As a result, Moroccan rugby was tied to the fortunes of France during the two world wars, with many Moroccan players going away to fight. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Moroccan rugby <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Europe for inspiration, {{rather than to the}} rest of Africa.|$|R
50|$|Libyan rugby is of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{although it has}} been played in neighbouring countries such as Italy and Malta, {{and to a lesser extent}} Tunisia. It is believed that the first rugby in Libya was played by British troops or possibly Italians. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Libyan rugby <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.|$|R
25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down on the use of blue {{because of the fact that}} judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E
25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this rhythm to the rest of the boat, and particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the blades on their side of the boat to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E
500|$|The cap is [...] in diameter, convex to cushion-shaped. The cap {{surface is}} dry, and younger {{specimens}} {{are covered with}} characteristic spikes; as the spikes break up with age, they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more hairy or woolly. Older specimens typically have the surface features worn off. The cap margin tends to be rolled inwards when young, gradually becoming straight with maturity. The color of the cap is bright or pale yellow, increasing in intensity towards {{the center of the}} cap. C.asprata has a web-like ring that soon disappears.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{complexity}} of the rules of word-breaking is that different [...] "dialects" [...] of English <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> differ on the rule: American English <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> work on sound, while British English <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the origins of the word and then to sound. There are also a large number of exceptions, which further complicates matters.|$|R
50|$|It is very important, as Cain explains, {{for police}} {{officers}} to experience relationships with their colleagues. The relationship <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like the following - experienced police officers exert power over the recruits, experienced officers <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> exert power over the cadets, senior officers <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> exert over experienced officers and the government exerts power over the senior officials.|$|R
500|$|The ultras who had {{allegedly}} plotted {{to exploit}} the post-13 May chaos were now {{in control of the}} country. Razaleigh, the Finance Minister, was hailed as the [...] "Father of the Bumiputra Economy" [...] Musa Hitam and Mahathir, both rising stars on the political scene, maintained their image as [...] "ultras", although it is unclear if this was their intention. Journalist K. Das once claimed Musa had told him [...] "that a young Malaysian politician has to play the race card to the hilt even if {{there was not a single}} chauvinistic bone in his body." [...] After retiring, Musa said that [...] "the national leaders <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a scapegoat when faced with a desperate crisis situation" [...] and use racial tactics to fill their [...] "empty stomach".|$|E
500|$|After {{the arrest}} in Toronto, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a file on Hendrix, which grew to seven pages, {{including}} {{documents related to}} his previous arrests for stealing cars {{at the age of}} 19. Yorke and Fong-Torres wrote, [...] "The populace of Toronto are a very conservative lot, and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> with suspicion upon anybody who looks and dresses a little different from themselves. Hendrix looks a lot different." [...] Lawrence commented: [...] "The prevailing political attitude in Canada regarding Hendrix was 'We have to make an example of this fuzzy-haired black weirdo'." [...] Shapiro and Glebbeek asserted their suspicion regarding the presence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who did not typically make arrests at the airport. They also speculated that Canadian authorities had anticipated a public spectacle, intentionally searching the Hendrix entourage in plain view of people at the airport.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, the {{character}} of Nancy Drew was used in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, which lasted until 1997. The Nancy of the Files series is also interested in romance and boys, a fact which led to much criticism of the series: [...] "Millie [...] purists <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> askance upon the Files series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi." [...] Cover art for Files titles, such as Hit and Run Holiday (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or breasts, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often chloroformed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against chokeholds. The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships.|$|E
50|$|He {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} improving the wealth of both his own family and his voivodeship. He {{was known to be}} a shrewd investor, something not common among the szlachta, who <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down upon merchants and people dealing with non-agricultural trade.|$|R
50|$|Many Balochis {{have not}} <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> favourably on Pakistan and the army's {{intervention}} in politics {{as they see}} the military as dominated by Punjabis {{and the interests of}} the Punjabis (who make up 45% of Pakistan's population) and lacking Baloch representation.|$|R
50|$|Traditional: A {{catch-all}} {{term for}} styles {{that do not}} fit with above. Traditional <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more like a family-shot video; it can be edited, but usually lightly. Everything is edited in a linear progression and usually in its entirety. These videos <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be 2 to 3 hours, or longer, in length.|$|R
500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising {{was not a good}} idea for most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur". Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version.|$|E
2500|$|In general, item {{information}} functions <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> bell-shaped. Highly discriminating items have tall, narrow information functions; {{they contribute}} greatly but over a narrow range. [...] Less discriminating items provide less information but over a wider range.|$|E
50|$|Like rugby {{union in}} Morocco, {{and many of}} the other North African countries, Tunisian rugby is a legacy of French {{colonialism}} after the First World War. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Tunisian rugby <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Europe for inspiration, rather than to the rest of Africa.|$|R
50|$|Like many North African countries, the {{historical}} connection with France {{is a mixed}} blessing. For a number of years, Algerian rugby players would leave to play there, which deprived Algerian rugby of any real competition. There are at least sixty Algerians playing in English and French rugby. Like many other Maghrebi nations, Algerian rugby <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> Europe for inspiration, {{rather than to the}} rest of Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Historian Dannielle Horan {{claims that}} while {{many in the}} US deride the French system as [...] "socialized medicine", the French do not {{consider}} their mixed public and private system [...] "socialized" [...] and the population <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down upon British- and Canadian-style socialized medicine.|$|R
2500|$|Both serif and {{sans-serif}} fonts {{have their}} own advantages and disadvantages. Serif fonts usually create lesser confusion among homoglyphs; whereas sans-serif fonts often <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> indistinguishable (such as uppercase ai (I) and lowercase eL (l) [...] ). The serifs or appendages help to recognize the letter easily. [...] But at the same time, serif fonts sometimes have a trend to bring multi-letter homoglyphs into action, due to fusion of appendages, especially if ink imprint on paper is not neat enough.|$|E
2500|$|After {{dissolution}} of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief {{is a very}} important process which leads to the acceptance of loss and eventually usually allows the person to move on. During this process people tend to use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for support, which is the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and {{pay more attention to the}} experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals [...] (Pistole, 1995).|$|E
2500|$|Gieseker {{showed that}} there is a coarse moduli scheme for {{surfaces}} of general type; this means that for any fixed values of the Chern numbers [...] there is a quasi-projective scheme classifying the surfaces of general type with those Chern numbers. It remains a very difficult problem to describe these schemes explicitly, and there are few pairs of Chern numbers for which this has been done (except when the scheme is empty). There are some indications that these schemes are in general too complicated to write down explicitly: the known upper bounds for the number of components are very large, some components can be non-reduced everywhere, components may have many different dimensions, and the few pieces that have been studied explicitly <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> rather complicated.|$|E
50|$|In general, Scully respects other {{officers}} of the LAPD, but <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> down on the FBI, Homeland Security or other agencies who try to squash {{the authority of the}} LAPD. Scully <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> dislike the media (comparing them to maggots in Cold Hit) as well as most bureaucracy as he sees them as interfering with his work.|$|R
25|$|The union, {{like most}} unions within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) at the time, had a largely {{decentralized}} structure, {{with a number}} of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated.|$|R
50|$|While {{some ancient}} (and modern) writers {{considered}} Abrupolis's routing by Perseus a {{primary cause of}} the Third Macedonian War, other, later Roman writers, and modern scholars, <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon it {{as an act of}} self-defense, with Rome merely using it as one pretext for a quarrel with Perseus.|$|R
