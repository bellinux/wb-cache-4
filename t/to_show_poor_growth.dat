30|$|Control of the monomeric {{composition}} of MCL-PHA in a fed-batch fermentation using a β-oxidation inhibitor is novel and challenging. Bacterial cultivation using fatty acid substrates {{in the presence}} of acrylic acid has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> produce <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> and MCL-PHA accumulation both in our chemostat studies (Jiang et al. 2012) and in the literature (Huijberts et al. 1994; Qi et al. 1998; Ward and O’Connor 2005). This is because β-oxidation is the only mechanism of energy production from aliphatic fatty acids. Thus, the strategy of co-feeding a carbon and energy source (glucose in this study) and a PHA precursor (nonanoic acid in this study) is essential to obtain a high cell density with high PHA content.|$|R
40|$|Background. Congenital {{disorders}} of glycosylation (CDG) are a {{group of}} rare disorders in which glycosylation required for proper protein-protein interactions and protein stability is disrupted, manifesting clinically with multiple system involvement and growth failure. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system {{plays an important role}} in childhood growth and has been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be dysfunctional with low IGF- 1 levels in children with CDG type Ia (PMM 2 deficiency). Case report. A 3 -year-old Caucasian male with failure to thrive was diagnosed with PMM 2 -CDG at 5 months of age. Initially, his length and weight were less than − 2 standard deviation score, IGF- 1 < 25 ng/mL (normal 55 - 327 ng/mL), IGFBP- 3 1. 0 µg/mL (normal 0. 7 - 3. 6 ng/mL), and acid-labile subunit 1. 3 mg/L (normal 0. 7 - 7. 9 mg/L). Despite aggressive feeding, he continued <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> linear <b>growth</b> and weight gain. At 17 months, he underwent an IGF- 1 generation test with growth hormone (0. 1 mg/kg/d) for 7 days; baseline IGF- 1 of 27 ng/mL (normal 55 - 327 ng/mL) stimulated to only 33 ng/mL. Recombinant human IGF- 1 (rhIGF- 1) therapy (up to 130 µg/kg/dose twice daily) was initiated at 21 months of age resulting in an excellent linear growth response with height increasing from − 2. 73 to − 1. 39 standard deviation score over 22 months. IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 levels also increased. Conclusion. This is the first case report of rhIGF- 1 therapy in a patient with PMM 2 -CDG. The child had an excellent linear growth response. These results provide additional in vivo evidence for IGF dysfunction in PMM 2 -CDG and suggest that rhIGF- 1 may be a novel treatment for growth failure in PMM 2 -CDG...|$|R
40|$|The {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) and O-antigen {{polysaccharide capsule}} structures of Francisella tularensis play significant roles in helping these highly virulent bacteria avoid detection within a host. We previously created pools of F. tularensis mutants that we screened to identify strains {{that were not}} reactive to a monoclonal antibody to the O-antigen capsule. To follow up previously published work, we characterize further seven of the F. tularensis Schu S 4 mutant strains identified by our screen. These F. tularensis strains carry the following transposon mutations: FTT 0846 ::Tn 5, hemH::Tn 5, wbtA::Tn 5, wzy::Tn 5, FTT 0673 p/prsA::Tn 5, manB::Tn 5, or dnaJ::Tn 5. Each of these strains displayed sensitivity to human serum, to varying degrees, when compared to wild-type F. tularensis Schu S 4. By Western blot, only FTT 0846 ::Tn 5, wbtA::Tn 5, wzy::Tn 5, and manB::Tn 5 strains did not react to the capsule and LPS O-antigen antibody 11 B 7, although the wzy::Tn 5 strain did have a single O-antigen reactive band that was detected by the FB 11 monoclonal antibody. Of these strains, manB::Tn 5 and FTT 0846 appear to have LPS core truncations, whereas wbtA::Tn 5 and wzy::Tn 5 had LPS core structures {{that are similar to}} the parent F. tularensis Schu S 4. These strains were also <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> within human monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). We examined the virulence of these strains in mice, following intranasal challenge, and found that each was attenuated compared to wild type Schu S 4. Our results provide additional strong evidence that LPS and/or capsule are F. tularensis virulence factors that most likely function by providing a stealth shield that prevents the host immune system from detecting this potent pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Yellow-eyed {{penguins}} {{have suffered}} major population declines and periodic mass mortality without an established cause. On Stewart Island a {{high incidence of}} regional chick mortality was associated with infection by a novel Leucocytozoon sp. The prevalence, structure and molecular characteristics of this leucocytozoon sp. were examined in the 2006 - 07 breeding season. In 2006 - 07, 100 % of chicks (n= 32) on the Anglem coast of Stewart Island died prior <b>to</b> fledging. Neonates <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> and died acutely at approximately 10 days old. Clinical signs in older chicks up to 108 days included anaemia, loss of body condition, subcutaneous ecchymotic haemorrhages and sudden death. Infected adults on Stewart Island showed no clinical signs and were in good body condition, suggesting adequate food availability and a potential reservoir source of ongoing infections. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) survey of blood samples from the South Island, Stewart and Codfish Island found Leucocytozoon infection exclusively on Stewart Island. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon infection in yellow-eyed penguin populations from each island ranged from 0 - 2. 8 % (South Island), to 0 - 21. 25 % (Codfish Island) and 51. 6 - 97. 9 % (Stewart Island). The high prevalence on Stewart Island represented the infection of 100 % of chicks and 83 % of adult yellow-eyed penguins when tested by PCR. Sequencing of Leucocytozoon sp. DNA found similarities between infections in yellow-eyed penguin adults and chicks, but differences to Leucocytozoon sp. DNA obtained from Fiordland crested penguins. These findings support the suggestion of cross infection between adults and chicks, and indicate that endemic infection in yellow-eyed penguins is unrelated to that in Fiordland crested penguins. Examination by histology and electron microscopy showed tissue megaloschizonts and circulating round gametocytes. Megaloschizonts up to 440 µm diameter showed an affinity for hepatic and splenic tissue and were observed releasing occasional intact cytomeres. Round gametocytes were observed within leucocytes in visceral sections, but not peripheral blood smears. The morphology of Leucocytozoon sp. in yellow-eyed penguins <b>showed</b> similarities <b>to</b> the pathogenic species L. simondi and L. sakharoffi but not L. tawaki. A successful treatment protocol for leucocytozoonosis has not been established, although treatment in a Fiordland crested penguin was able to suppress parasitaemia. The role of Leucocytozoon in yellow-eyed penguins as a cause of morbidity and mortality remains unclear. Further investigation into direct pathogenicity, and the interaction of concurrent disease and environmental influences is required. The findings of this thesis provide potential management recommendations and highlight areas requiring further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} studies {{designed}} {{to examine the}} production patterns of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) subject to defoliation. Dry matter yield estimates, seasonal distribution of production, plant disease and long term survival were considered for three sainfoin cultivars in a field trial run over a three year period. Assimilate partitioning and closer examination of plant morphology was studied using two of the cultivars grown under controlled environment conditions. Sainfoin was successfully established in the spring period and early growth rates and dry matter production were at least as good as those of lucerne. All cultivars grown showed a tendency towards relatively early flowering when compared to lucerne. Only Fakir, the earliest flowering of the three cultivars, regrew sufficiently to be harvested a second time under the conservative harvesting regime imposed to maximise uninterupted growth during the establishment year. The results of the two different cutting heights provided little {{evidence to support the}} higher of the two cuts (12 - 15 cm). The main outcome was to leave about 25 % of the dry matter behind as stem with little gain in residual leaf area to provide a photosynthetic surface for regrowth. Subsequent growth and regrowth cycles in the field gave yields of up to 12 t/ha of herbage dry matter in a single season. All cultivar and management combinations tended <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> autumn <b>growth,</b> with the plant adopting a rosette habit when lucerne was still actively growing. Also while the cultivar and. management combinations gave a variable number of harvests in a given season, there was no evidence to support any one management approach as being superior in production. The later maturing cultivar Melrose did provide some indication that higher yields may be possible from a later maturing plant, but also provided evidence of the potential for marked leaf loss when the plant was maturing under drying conditions. Leaf loss aggravated the situation of low leaf area indices that was shown for all three sainfoin cultivars. Plant losses in the field trial resulted in uneven stands and contributed to the sampling variability which reduced the sensitivity of the experiment. While some of the losses were possibly related to the plants consistently harvested at a vegetative stage, all sainfoin plants were susceptible to a crown-root rot complex. This was indicated by necrosis of the crown tissue and vascular tissue of the tap-root which was often extensive and extending well below ground level. Controlled environment studies provided further evidence of the poor regrowth ability displayed in the field. This would appear to be a result of a combination of the poor development of any new shoots to provide a start point for regrowth, little leaf area remaining {{at the base of the}} plant after harvest to provide a photosynthetic surface, and losses of root and nodule tissue from the plant after the stress of harvest. This tissue was subsequently replaced, possibly at the expense of top growth. Movement of assimilates to the root system did not tend to support any hypothesis of a build-up phase which may have interacted with management. Indication of the within-cultivar variation for sainfoin was clearly shown under the controlled environment conditions. Multivariate analysis of the data provided a preliminary estimate of the gains that might be possible if certain groups of attributes formed the base of a selection programme. Future prospects for sainfoin in grassland farming were proposed in the light of this information, and that gained from the field trial. These focused on the need to more fully evaluate sainfoin as a species, or group of species, and establish its demands rather than assume it will conform to the management model provided by other summer active forage crops...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{considerable}} {{efforts have}} been made to understand how nutrition impacts health and productivity during the postnatal period. While maternal nutrition during pregnancy plays an essential role in proper fetal and placental development, less is known about how maternal nutrition impacts the health and productivity of the offspring. Indeed, the prenatal growth trajectory is sensitive to the direct and indirect effects of maternal dietary intake from the earliest stages of embryonic life when the nutrient requirements for conceptus growth are negligible (Robinson et al., 1977). Not only is neonatal health compromised, but the subsequent health may be “programmed” as offspring from undernourished dams have been <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> exhibit <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> and productivity and also to develop significant diseases later in life (Barker et al., 1993; Godfrey and Barker, 2000). Fetal, or developmental programming, defined as the concept that a maternal stimulus or insult at a critical period in fetal development has long term impacts on the offspring, was originally coined by Dr. David Barker, at Southampton University in England (Barker et al., 1993; Godfrey and Barker, 2000). Barker and his colleagues studied birth records in the United Kingdom and Europe, and related different maternal stresses to infant weight and physical characteristics at birth and to subsequent health status in later life. Of interest was that they determined that maternal undernutrition {{in the first half of}} gestation, followed by adequate nutrition from mid-gestation to term, resulted in infants of normal birth weight, which were proportionally longer and thinner than normal. This early fetal undernutrition resulted in an increased incidence of health problems experienced by these individuals as adults, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In livestock production settings, undernutrition can often occur during gestation, particularly during the first two trimesters. This results from either low feed reserves and(or) management practices that result in cows losing weight during late fall and early winter (Sletmoen-Olsen et al., 2000 a,b). However, current data indicate that health and growth of offspring born from undernourished mothers are diminished (Godfrey and Barker, 2000; Vonnahme et al., 2003). This theory of developmental programming has been experimentally challenged and verified using several animal models. While variations in the duration and severity of maternal undernutrition do not always result in a reduced birth weight, physiologic alterations such as glucose intolerance, skewed growth patterns and even alterations in carcass characteristics have been reported. Therefore, birth weight in and of itself may not be the best predictor for calf survival and productivity. The objective of this paper is to review the literature on bovine fetal and placental development and how maternal nutrition impacts fetal, neonatal and postnatal health and performance of the offspring. While this work will concentrate on beef cattle, examples from other species will be added when appropriate...|$|R

In the present study, we investigated the underlying reason for this growth dependence of G. thermoglucosidans. Whole-genome sequences of 4 A. flavithermus strains and 4 G. thermoglucosidans strains were acquired, with special attention given to carbohydrate utilization clusters and proteolytic enzymes. Focusing on traits relevant for dairy environments, comparative genomic analysis revealed that all G. thermoglucosidans strains lacked the genes necessary for lactose transport and metabolism, <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> in skim milk, and produced white colonies on X-gal plates, indicating the lack of β-galactosidase activity. The A. flavithermus isolates scored positive in these tests, consistent with the presence of a putative lactose utilization gene cluster.

Adding glucose or galactose to liquid skim milk supported growth of G. thermoglucosidans isolates, in line with the presence of the respective monosaccharide utilization gene clusters in the genomes. Analysis by HPLC of A. flavithermus TNO- 09. 006 culture filtrate indicated that the previously described growth dependence of G. thermoglucosidans in skim milk was based on the supply of glucose and galactose by A. flavithermus TNO- 09. 006...|$|R

P. chrysogenum pex 5 disruptants {{appear to be}} highly unstable, <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth,</b> and are unable to sporulate asexually.

Detailed analysis demonstrated that the PTS 1 proteins dihydroxyacetone synthase and catalase were almost fully imported into microbodies. Surprisingly, alcohol oxidase, which also depends on Pex 5 p for import into microbodies, remained mainly in the cytosol. Thus, P. chrysogenum Pex 5 p has a different specificity of cargo recognition than its H. polymorpha counterpart.

40|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{designed}} to monitor psychotherapy outcome, in which feedback is generated based on how a client 2 ̆ 7 s rate of progress compares to an expected level of progress. Clients who progress at a much lesser rate than the average client are referred to as signal-alarm cases. Recent studies have shown that providing feedback to therapists based on comparing their clients 2 ̆ 7 progress to a set of rational, clinically derived algorithms has enhanced outcomes for clients predicted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> treatment outcomes. Should another method of predicting psychotherapy outcome emerge as more accurate than the rational method, this method would likely be more useful than the rational method in enhancing psychotherapy outcomes. The present study compared the rational algorithms to those generated by an empirical prediction method generated through hierarchical linear modeling. The sample consisted of 299 clients seen at a university counseling center and a psychology training clinic. The empirical method was significantly more accurate in predicting outcome than was the rational method. Clients predicted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> treatment outcome by the empirical method showed, on average, very little positive change. There was no difference between the methods in the ability to accurately forecast reliable worsening during treatment. The rational method resulted in a high percentage of false alarms, that is, clients who were predicted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> treatment response but in fact showed a positive treatment outcome. The empirical method generated significantly fewer false alarms than did the rational method. The empirical method was generally accurate in its predictions of treatment success, whereas the rational method was somewhat less accurate in predicting positive outcomes. Suggestions for future research in psychotherapy quality management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|For many decades, {{economists have}} {{discussed}} the role of agricultural productivity and natural resources in economic development. By the late 20 th century, various studies <b>showed</b> the <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> experience of resource-rich countries in the post- world war-II period. Doppellhofer (2000) concluded {{that none of the}} countries with extremely abundant natural resources in 1970 grew rapidly for the next 20 years, with the exception of Malaysia, Mauritius and Iceland. Other studies that yielded similar conclusions include Auty (1990), Gelb (1988), Sachs and Warner (1995, 1999), and Gylfason et al. (1999). This phenomenon of lower economic growth among resource abundant countries is known as a resource curse...|$|R
30|$|Pyruvate {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the central carbon metabolism of multiple organisms and is used as a raw material in the chemical, biochemical and pharmaceutical industries. To meet demand, large amounts of pyruvate are produced through fermentation processes. Here we describe a simple and efficient method for producing pyruvate in Escherichia coli. To stop carbon flux from pyruvate to fatty acids, the accBC genes, which encode the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis and is essential for vegetative growth, were manipulated within the genome; its native promoter was replaced with the tetracycline (or doxycycline)-regulated promoter and the corresponding transcriptional regulator genes. The resulting strain grew normally in the presence of doxycycline, but <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> upon withdrawal of doxycycline. Using this strain, we developed a high pyruvate producing strain (strain LAFCPCPt-accBC-aceE), in which the tetracycline-regulated promoter was also introduced upstream of aceE, and the ackA-pta, adhE, cra, ldhA, pflB and poxB genes were deleted. After determining the optimal culture conditions for this strain, the final pyruvate concentration reached 26.1  g L− 1 after 72  h with a theoretical yield of 55.6  %. These levels are high enough to indicate that the developed strain has the potential for application to industrial production of pyruvate.|$|R
40|$|Potassium (K) {{efficiency}} and physiological mechanisms of two cotton cultivars (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were studied in 2007 using a pot experiment at different K levels (-K and +K). The results showed {{significant differences in}} K efficiency between the two genotypes (Genotype 103, a high K {{efficiency and}} high yield potential genotype; and genotype 122, a low K efficiency and low yield potential genotype). Genotype 103 had higher boll numbers, lower boll shed rate and higher lint yield. The lint yield of genotype 103 was 1. 83 times that of genotype 122 at ＋K treatment, and 2. 57 times that of genotype 122 at －K treatment. However, K concentrations {{in different parts of}} genotype 103 were lower than that in genotype 122. This suggests that genotype 103 maintained its normal physiological function with low K concentration. Genotype 122 <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> with higher K concentration in the tissues yet lower ability to absorb and utilize soil K. In both genotypes, K application significantly increased fiber uniformity, strength, length and micronaire. At same K level, genotype 103 had higher lint percent and moderate fiber length, length uniformity, strength, elongation and micronaire, whereas genotype 122 had higher fiber length, micronaire and moderate lint percent, length uniformity, strength, and lower elongation...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this study showed that the growth of opihi did not {{correlate}} to increased dietary protein levels. Statistical analysis by One-way ANOVA showed that there was no significant (P >  0.05) difference in weight gain and SGR of opihi among the diets from 270 to 470  g kg− 1 protein. As stated above, no statistically significant difference in growth rates among the diets may be due to a low survival of animals. Therefore, it is premature to draw any conclusion from the Trial 1 and the data may be use as a preliminary for following trial. Better and significant data were obtained in Trial 2 (Table  3; Fig.  2). The highest weight gain was achieved with the 350  g kg− 1 protein diet, but {{there was no significant difference}} in weight gain with those animals fed with 210 and 300  g kg− 1 diets. This indicated that opihi could satisfy their needs with a low protein level above 210  g kg− 1. The trend of the growth rate suggests that when the protein level is too high it may be detrimental to growth. In fact, the results from the 500  g kg− 1 protein group in the second trial <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth,</b> significantly lower than the other diets, indicating that excess protein is not easily metabolized by opihi.|$|R
40|$|Bacteriocins {{are natural}} {{antibacterial}} peptides ribosomally biosynthesized by bacteria. Gassericin T {{which is a}} bacteriocin produced by many strains of Lactobacillus gasseri has a broad antibacterial spectrum against food spoilage and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria; therefore, the bacteriocin and its producers are predicted for use as safe food preservatives. However, probiotic Lb. gasseri strains <b>show</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> and minimally produce gassericin T in food-grade natural media such as reconstituted cheese whey, unlike in MRS broth. The growth of Lb. gasseri in reconstituted cheese whey was improved by adding proteose peptone as a nutrient factor. The production of gassericin T in MRS broth was specifically inhibited by adding divalent metal cations, and then the inhibition was removed using a chelator of divalent cations, trisodium citrate dihydrate. The production of gassericin T in reconstituted cheese whey was also restored by adding trisodium citrate dihydrate, and the activity was enhanced by a surfactant, Tween 80. In addition, trisodium citrate dihydrate led to over-production of and synergistic antibacterial effect with gassericin T. In this study, we developed a cheese whey-based medium containing proteose peptone, trisodium citrate dihydrate and Tween 80 for gassericin T production. The developed food-grade medium {{may contribute to the}} effective use of some bacteriocins from probiotic lactic acid bacteria for biopreservation of foods...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{possible}} role of plant parasitic nematodes as {{a driving force}} of change in natural vegetation is analysed using the succession at coastal foredunes as a model. In pot trials, when grown in natural substrates from mature stands, seedlings of dominant foredune plants <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> when compared <b>to</b> sterilised substrates. In natural substrates from preceding stages, growth reduction was far less, or even non- significant. Chemical soil treatment with nematicides resulted in enhanced growth of the seedlings. Inoculation of ectoparasitic nematodes reduced plant growth, but only at densities much higher than those occurring in control pots with unsterilised field soil. Identification at species level showed that endoparasitic nematodes are specifically associated with particular plant species. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the distribution of endoparasitic nematodes {{may be an important}} factor leading to the specific nature of soil pathogen complexes in coastal foredunes. We discuss the role of endoparasitic nematodes as possible key species in soil communities and compare {{the possible}} effects of specific vs. generalistic plant parasitic nematodes in soil communities on vegetation processes.

40|$|Four minor {{seed oils}} from Abroma augusta (AA), Annona {{squamosa}} (AS), Bombax ceiba (BC) and Ceiba pentandra (CP) plants were refined and refined seed oils were analyzed for their physicochemical properties. All the refined seed oils had normal physicochemical characteristics. The seed oils except CP also had usual fatty acid composition and contained {{a higher proportion}} of unsaturated fatty acids namely linoleic and oleic, a suitable criterion of edibility of vegetable oils. In addition to normal fatty acids, the refined CP seed oil also contained 10. 6 % cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFA), therefore, is not recommended as a dietary source of fat unless a suitable method is developed for its removal or detoxification. Nutritional evaluation of the refined seed oils were carried out in rats by feeding the respective oils and peanut oil as control at 10 % level in a 20 % protein diet with adequate vitamins and minerals. The refined CP seed oil <b>showed</b> <b>poor</b> <b>growth</b> performance, low FER, altered lipid metabolism and histopathological abnormalities in the liver which indicate the unsuitability of it for edible purpose. Growth performances, FER, serum and liver lipids, organ weights and histopathological findings of other three minor oils were satisfactory and comparable to that of peanut oil, therefore, they can be considered for edible use...|$|R
