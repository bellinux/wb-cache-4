Most of them, however, are actually lexical roots, in that they can be used as independent words and their relative order in a compound is determined by semantics, not grammar. They are called [...] "affixes" [...] mainly because they derive from affixes in Esperanto's source languages. Some are true affixes in that, although they may be used independently, their order within a word is fixed by the grammar. Only a few cannot be used independently and so correspond to how a typical affix behaves in English.|$|E

Because of his role in the disputed 1804 treaty, Quashquame was reduced from a principal leader of the Sauk to a minor chief. [...] "Quasquawma, was chief of this tribe once, but being cheated out of the mineral country, as the Indians allege, he was denigrated from his rank and his son-in-law <b>Tiama</b> elected in his stead." ...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of wood production, and {{particularly}} of diameter increment of trees, {{is central to}} forest management. This {{is one of the}} parameters contributing to determination of the length of the felling cycle as well as the maximum allowable cut without impoverishment of forest stands. Two techniques can be used to assess diameter increment of trees: analysis of growth rings and periodical measurements of circumference over a given period. The results obtained with several designs, in which trees have been periodically measured for more than ten years (Mopi, Irobo and La Téné in Cote de Ivoire, Mbaiki in Central African Republic and Oyane in Gabon), provide increments for each species. In the same way, several growth ring counts were carried out for species with visible annual growth rings, especially in Cameroon, Central African Republic and Gabon. This report describes the methodology used for growth ring analysis, the application of such analysis for each tree species, as well as a synthesis of the results obtained for the main species exploited in Central and West Africa. The following species are included: Ayous/Samba (Triplochiton sideroxylon), Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), Limba/Fraké (Terminalia superba), Sipo (Entandrophragma utile), Tali (Erythrophleum ivorense), <b>Tiama</b> (Entandrophragma angolensis), Kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei), Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) and Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma). It appears that the mean diameter increment of Meliaceae (Sapelli, Sipo, Kosipo and <b>Tiama</b> - Entandrophragma spp.) and Iroko (Milicia excelsa) is 4 - 5 mm/year. The increment is 2 - 3 mm/year for slow-growing species, such as Bossé clair (Guarea cedrata) and Kotibé (Nesogordonia papaverifera), while mean annual increment of Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) is slightly under 10 mm/year for trees with diameters from 20 to 100 cm...|$|E

The data are compared with {{the results of}} growth ring analyses carried out in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Gabon. The data were collected in a series of sampling trips to measure trunk girths in tree plots (Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana and Gabon). They will provide a basis for calculating rotations between potential successive logging operations within the framework of forest development projects...|$|E
