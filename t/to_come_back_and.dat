25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} {{about the real}} identity of {{the architect of the}} Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered {{at the foot of the}} tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.|$|E
