5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, {{the stars of}} Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E

5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E
5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E

40|$|Many terms exist <b>to</b> {{describe}} <b>radiating</b> leg pain or symptoms {{associated with}} back pain (e. g., sciatica or radiculopathy) {{and it appears}} that these terms are used inconsistently. We examined the terms used to describe, and the eligibility criteria used <b>to</b> define, <b>radiating</b> leg pain in randomized controlled trials of conservative treatments, and evaluated how the eligibility criteria compared to an international pain taxonomy. Eligible studies were identified from two systematic reviews and an updated search of their search strategy. Studies were included if they recruited adults with radiating leg pain associated with back pain. Two independent reviewers screened the studies and extracted data. Studies were grouped according to the terms used <b>to</b> describe <b>radiating</b> leg pain. Thirty-one of the seventy-seven included studies used multiple terms <b>to</b> describe <b>radiating</b> leg pain; the most commonly used terms were sciatica (60 studies) and disc herniation (19 studies). Most studies that used the term sciatica included pain distribution in the eligibility criteria, but studies were inconsistent in including signs (e. g., neurological deficits) and imaging findings. Similarly, studies that used other terms <b>to</b> describe <b>radiating</b> leg pain used inconsistent eligibility criteria between studies and to the pain taxonomy, except that positive imaging findings were required for almost all studies that used disc herniation <b>to</b> describe <b>radiating</b> leg pain.

5|$|Each November, the Andromedids {{meteor shower}} appears <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> from Andromeda. The shower peaks in mid-to-late November every year, {{but has a}} low peak rate of fewer than two meteors per hour. Astronomers have often {{associated}} the Andromedids with Biela's Comet, which was destroyed in the 19th century, but that connection is disputed. Andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself {{is considered to be}} diffuse, as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from Andromeda itself. Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red fireballs. The Andromedids were associated with the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second (a zenithal hourly rate of 10,000), prompting one Chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain. The Andromedids had another outburst on December 3–5, 2011, the most active shower since 1885, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 50 meteors per hour. The 2011 outburst was linked to ejecta from Comet Biela, which passed close to the Sun in 1649. None of the meteoroids observed were associated with material from the comet's 1846 disintegration. The observers of the 2011 outburst predicted outbursts in 2018, 2023, and 2036.|$|E

This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use.

25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Historically, two doctrines {{concerning}} {{executive power}} have developed that enable {{the president to}} exercise executive power {{with a degree of}} autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.|$|E

500|$|Excess {{infrared}} radiation from Beta Pictoris {{was detected by}} the IRAS spacecraft in 1983. Along with Vega, Fomalhaut and Epsilon Eridani, {{it was one of}} the first four stars from which such an excess was detected: these stars are called [...] "Vega-like" [...] after the first such star discovered. Since A-type stars like Beta Pictoris tend <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> most of their energy at the blue end of the spectrum, this implied the presence of cool matter in orbit around the star, which would radiate at infrared wavelengths and produce the excess. This hypothesis was verified in 1984 when Beta Pictoris became the first star to have its circumstellar disk imaged optically. The IRAS data are (at the micron wavelenghs): =2.68, =0.05, =--2.74 and =--3.41. The colourexcesses are: [...] E12=0.69, E25=3.35, E60=6.17 and E100=6.90.|$|E
500|$|As was {{explained}} by Leon Mestel in 1952, unless the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or other source, its radiation comes from its stored heat, {{which is not}} replenished.,§2.1. White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area <b>to</b> <b>radiate</b> this heat from, so they cool gradually, remaining hot for a long time. As a white dwarf cools, its surface temperature decreases, the radiation which it emits reddens, and its luminosity decreases. Since the white dwarf has no energy sink other than radiation, it follows that its cooling slows with time. The rate of cooling has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0.59 [...] with a hydrogen atmosphere. After initially taking approximately 1.5billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7,140K, cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6,590K takes around 0.3billion years, but the next two steps of around 500kelvins (to 6,030K and 5,550K) take first 0.4 and then 1.1billion years., Table 2.|$|E
