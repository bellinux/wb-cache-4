25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit.

Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with.

After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, that was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump {{at the beginning of}} the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown had a {{difficult}} childhood; after her divorce, his working mother received welfare benefits. Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole." ...|$|E

He is frequently cited as {{having one of}} the best serves among his contemporaries, along with Karlović and Isner. Some consider Raonic's serve to be among the best of all time. Sampras, Raonic's childhood idol, describes the Canadian's serve as [...] "bigger than big." [...] After a match against Raonic, Djokovic commented [...] "I can't recall <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was feeling so helpless returning. Even his second serve." [...] Women's tennis player Serena Williams has said that [...] "If she could take one thing from another player, it would be Milos Raonic's serve." [...] Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Raonic has one of the fastest recorded serves of all time.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!"

500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E

500|$|Alberto Contador had {{on various}} {{previous}} occasions {{announced that the}} 2016 {{would be his last}} as a professional racer. After his victory in the Tour of the Basque Country, however, he said [...] "I'm sure this isn't <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> come here" [...] and said that he would probably continue beyond the 2016 season. It was his first general classification victory since the 2015 Route du Sud; he dedicated the victory to his fans and to Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the Tinkoff team. Sergio Henao said that he had tried a different tactic in the time trial – holding back early on in order to give more effort later in the stage – and said that he was pleased both with his own performance and with how his team had ridden. He said that he was feeling strong ahead of his main objectives for the season, the Ardennes classics. Quintana said that his bike change in the time trial had helped, but that it was not quite enough to win the stage. He said that he was pleased with how he had ridden the race and in particular with how he had recovered from illness earlier in the week.|$|E
500|$|At Salon.com, Joyce Millman writes, [...] "there hasn't been a finer hour {{of drama}} on TV {{this year than}} ... 'The Body' ... You have {{to hand it to}} the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E
500|$|Billy Vaughn covered [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] on his 1967 Ode to Billy Joe {{instrumental}} album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album My Woman, My Woman, My Wife. Glen Campbell's version {{appeared on}} his 1971 album <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Saw Her, Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album Lonely People, and George Strait's on his 1992 album Holding My Own. Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 Here We Go Again album, {{but she did}} not include it on her 2007 duets album , which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of ABQ Journal. Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2. It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 Greatest Collection at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album The Red One.|$|E

500|$|Stereogum {{journalist}} Tom Breihan described [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "a squelchy, Prince-ly old-school sex-ballad" [...] {{in which}} the singer seemingly [...] "melt into the track". He stated that despite [...] "nothing remotely innovative about it... I can't remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard a ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging on {{a minute or two}} too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience. In the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, [...] "Rocket" [...] was ranked at number 424.|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting.

These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Battalion began {{landing on}} Gavutu at 10:00 on 8 August and {{assisted}} in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet, which {{was completed by}} 12:00. Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo. The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack. In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier-based dive bombers and naval gunfire bombardment were requested. After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled. San Juan, however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes. The Marine assault began at 16:15, both by landing craft and across the causeway, and, with assistance from two marine Stuart light tanks, began making headway against the Japanese defenses. One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support {{was surrounded by a}} [...] "frenzied mob" [...] of about 50 Japanese airmen. [...] The Japanese set fire to the tank, killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire. The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned-out hulk of the tank, including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots. One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported, [...] "I recall seeing my officer, Lieutenant Commander Saburo Katsuta of the Yokohama Air Group, on top of the tank.

He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E
