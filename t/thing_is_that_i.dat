As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have a lot of}} younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vocalist Anthony Green {{left the}} band Saosin, in 2004, later noting [...] "the big <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just scared. I {{was scared of}} committing". Green met up with Colin Frangicetto, a friend {{with whom he had}} [...] "jammed" [...] during his stay, and they decided to begin {{recording}} and recruiting. Thus, Circa Survive was born.|$|R
2500|$|Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy, {{appeared}} in 2014. Admitting to having {{paid little attention}} to Liddle's journalism, Will Self, in his review for The Guardian wrote: [...] "it's so much more authoritative to hear a man condemned out of his own mouth over 200-plus pages than it is to assay him on the basis of newspaper columns, which, by and large, favour polarised views tendentiously expressed." [...] Despite his serious reservations about Liddle's writing, Self concludes: [...] "The peculiar <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't find it in my heart of hearts to dislike the man, I think there's good in him and that he can change his bilious complexion." [...] Liddle responded to Self's review in an interview with Archie Bland of The Independent a few weeks later: [...] "He reviewed what he thought I was, not what the book was about. Bizarre. I think it's slightly deranged." ...|$|E

[...] "I've {{always had a}} low voice, but {{you can find a}} couple of shitty covers on YouTube from when I was 12 or whatever, and my voice is quite nasal. Strange tonally.
