[...] As a result, the poet repeats the phrase [...] "He cam also stylle" [...] {{in three of the}} five verses. [...] "Stylle" [...] had several implications – <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the conception of Mary and of the birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{art critic}} Tom Lubbock {{considered}} the painting [...] "one {{of the most}} striking" [...] chronophotography-inspired works, pointing to several features which create a comical effect: the [...] "abrupt close-up" [...] on a trivial subject—a [...] "twee prim sausage dog"—which {{might have been a}} single detail in an Impressionist street scene; the [...] juxtaposition of the word dynamism, [...] "with its connotations of heroism, of the mighty modern machine world" [...] against that subject; the cropping of the owner at the knee, giving a dog's view (and anticipating Tom and Jerry cartoons); and the apparently frenetic motion of the dog's limbs and tail coupled with <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> its body, suggesting little forward progress. Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as [...] "creating new sensations and new phenomena", and evoking the motion of shuffling cards and the embodiment of ghosts.|$|E

2500|$|John Gielgud {{calculated}} that his grandmother played about 100 roles in her short career. Her last stage appearance before her retirement was in October 1867 at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, in Tom Taylor's Plot and Passion. The Manchester Guardian ended its {{report on the}} performance: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with {{the memory of the}} peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ranney enjoyed duck hunting, {{which is}} {{reflected}} {{in some of his}} paintings on that theme, which are noted for their solidly constructed, almost sculpture-like figures. His most popular and requested work is his 1850 painting On the Wing, which portrays a sportsman with dead game at his feet, about to shoot down his next target. Ranney produced at least four different versions of this print, the most recognized of which was reserved for the Butler Institute of American Art. It was published in the gift book Ornaments of Memory in 1856 and 1857. This version is set in a more windblown environment, noted for the contrast generated with <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the human figures within it. The portrayal of the outdoorsman in On the Wing contributed to the era's nationalistic imagery. Mark Thistelthwaite of the Butler Institute, describes this piece as: ...|$|E

2500|$|Kate (1844–1924) was {{the first}} of the Terry {{children}} to make the family name famous on the English stage, beginning her career as a small child. According to the academic Nina Auerbach, Kate may have been the most accomplished actor among her siblings, quickly gaining praise in the plays of Shakespeare, among others. Contemporary critics thought the same: The Manchester Guardian ended its report of her last performance before her retirement: [...] "In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting ... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing <b>the</b> <b>stillness</b> <b>of</b> the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note." [...] She gave up acting when she married the businessman Arthur James Lewis (1824–1901) in 1867 when she was 23. She made only two later stage appearances, the first in 1898, in a small role supporting her daughter Mabel in a new play in the West End; the second was in 1906 at her sister Ellen's jubilee celebrations at Drury Lane. Of her four children, all daughters, only the youngest, Mabel, followed her into the theatrical profession. The two middle daughters were Janet and Lucy. Kate's eldest daughter, also named Kate, married Frank Gielgud; their four children included Val and John Gielgud.|$|E
