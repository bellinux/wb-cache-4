5|$|Among heterodontosaurids, only Heterodontosaurus {{itself is}} known from a {{complete}} skeleton. Fragmentary skeletal remains of Abrictosaurus are known {{but have not}} been fully described, while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments and teeth. Consequently, most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies (defining features) have been described from the <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> jaw bones. Heterodontosaurus measured just over 1meter (3.3ft) in length, while the fragmentary remains of Lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual.|$|E

5|$|The <b>teeth</b> <b>and</b> gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events.

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their <b>teeth,</b> <b>and</b> that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
