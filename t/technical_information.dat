It also contained two full scripts from the planned series.|$|E
5|$|According to On a Field of Red, {{a history}} of the Comintern (Communist International) by Anthony Cave Brown and Charles B.

Fuchs gave Gold <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> in January 1945 that was acquired only after two years of experimentation at a cost of $400 million. Fuchs also disclosed the amount of uranium or plutonium the Americans planned to use in each atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|After emigrating to the United States in 1941, she {{was granted}} a Carnegie Fellowship to {{continue}} her research and provided <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> on her polonium extraction methods to the Manhattan Project. Later in her career, she became a nuclear chemistry professor at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies and after 15 years there transferred to the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Miami. At both Oak Ridge and Miami, she continued her work on the geochronology of seabed elements and radiometric dating. She was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Women's Hall of Fame in 2015.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> is available about lenses, shutters {{and the speed}} of the photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E

5|$|On 27 October, {{the same}} day Rhys-Davids died in action, a British {{intelligence}} officer finally gained access to the wreckage after it had lain {{a month in the}} open. He verified it was a triplane, and noted that its upper surfaces were camouflage green and its bottom surfaces were blue. Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some small pieces from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points. The <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> that was reported gave the British their first insight into the new craft, although Voss had swapped in a French Le Rhone engine.|$|E

5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The British Library {{was created}} on 1 July 1973 {{as a result}} of the British Library Act 1972. Prior to this, the {{national}} library was part of the British Museum, which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the National Central Library, the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography). In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and <b>Technical</b> <b>Information</b> were taken over; in 1982 the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO Binderies became British Library responsibilities. In 1983, the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive, which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.|$|E
