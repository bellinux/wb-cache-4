40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} effect of columellar struts and cephalic trim on <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> and tip {{rotation}} using digitized photographs. METHODS: Using photographs of 62 patients who underwent external rhinoplasty, we retrospectively analyzed nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> (the Goode method) and rotation (nasolabial angle) before and after surgery. A cartilaginous strut was used in 36 patients, whereas 26 patients did not receive a strut. Patients were categorized into 4 subgroups, depending on the placement of a strut (placement, strut+ vs nonplacement, strut-) {{and the removal of}} the cephalic margin (removal, cephalic+ vs nonremoval, cephalic-) of the lateral crus: strut-/cephalic-, n = 17; strut+/cephalic-, n = 23; strut-/cephalic+, n = 9; strut+/cephalic+, n = 12. RESULTS: Nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection,</b> measured with the Goode method, increased from 0. 58 to 0. 60 (P =. 02) in the strut+ group; in the strut- group, nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> did not change significantly. Nasolabial angle increased from 93. 96 degrees to 100. 92 degrees in the strut+/cephalic- group and from 88. 30 degrees to 95. 06 degrees in the strut+/cephalic+ group. Removal of the cephalic margin alone (strut-/cephalic+) hardly affected tip rotation (P =. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The external rhinoplasty approach did not lead to a decrease in nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection.</b> A cartilaginous strut slightly increased nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> and also increased nasal tip rotation. This effect was accentuated by the removal of the cephalic margin of the lateral crus...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundNasal tip {{support is}} an {{essential}} consideration for rhinoplasty in East Asians. There are many techniques to improve <b>tip</b> <b>projection,</b> and among them, the columellar strut {{is the most popular}} technique. However, the conventional design is less supportive for rotating the tip. The amount of harvestable septal cartilage is relatively small in East Asians. For an optimal outcome, we propose an L-shaped design for applying the columellar strut. MethodsTo evaluate the anthropometric outcomes, the change in nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> and the columella-labial angle were analyzed by comparing preoperative and postoperative photographs.

40|$|AbstractDuring the G 1 {{phase of}} the cell cycle, cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe can be induced to mate by {{nitrogen}} starvation {{and the presence of}} mating pheromones. Polarised growth towards cells of the opposite mating type (P or M) leads to the formation of a <b>projection</b> <b>tip</b> and, upon contact, localised cell wall degradation results in conjugation and cell fusion [1]. Here, we have investigated the role of microtubules in this process. We describe a previously unidentified microtubule-organising centre (MTOC) that forms at <b>projection</b> <b>tips</b> upon cell-to-cell contact, before cells fuse. Treatment of mating cells with the microtubule-destabilising drug thiabendazole (TBZ) showed that microtubule integrity was required for mating at two distinct stages: during <b>projection</b> <b>tip</b> formation and cell fusion. <b>Projection</b> <b>tip</b> formation requires filamentous (F) actin function [2] and microtubules are required for the localisation of F actin to the <b>projection</b> <b>tip.</b> We also identify a role during mating for Mad 2 – a mitotic checkpoint protein that is required in all eukaryotes to maintain the mitotic state in response to microtubule depolymerisation [3]. S. pombe mad 2 mutant cells were compromised in their ability to mate upon removal of TBZ, indicating that in fission yeast, in the absence of microtubules, Mad 2 is also required to maintain mating competence...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{technique}} of vertical dome division or tip defining, involves incising the lateral crura and vestibular skin at or lateral to the dome or tip defining point. The incision divides the lower lateral cartilage into a lateral segment and a medial segment, which are advanced anteriorly and sutured together to increase <b>tip</b> <b>projection.</b> The present study aimed at assessing a new vertical dome division, {{which is a}} modified version of vertical dome technique to decrease nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection,</b> and increase or decrease nasal tip rotation and other tip deformities. Methods: The medical files of patients undergone rhinoplasty from 2003 to 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. The files were selected from a computerized rhinoplasty database of patients, who had been operated using a modified vertical dome technique and followed-up for one year or more after the surgery.

40|$|Background This study {{aimed at}} {{overcoming}} the disadvantages of septal extension grafts {{and keeping the}} nasal tip as natural as possible by using different forms of the graft and additional supporting methods depending on the case. Methods Among 458 patients who received a septal extension graft from March 2008 to September 2011, 107 patients were selected who underwent at least a 6 -month follow-up. Patients were categorized according to the primary objective of the operation; an upturned tip correction or tip lengthening, tip lengthening with <b>tip</b> <b>projection,</b> or retracted columella correction. Each group of patients received {{a different type of}} septal extension graft out of 3 different types of grafts based on the purpose of the operation. The evaluation of the results was made from by comparing preoperative and postoperative photographs of the tip angle, projection, and nasolabial angle. Results The average tip angle for the patients in the upturned tip correction group was reduced to 98. 3 from 124. 9 degrees. For the patients in the tip lengthening with <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> group, the average tip angle was reduced to 96. 8 from 122. 4 degrees and the average <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> was increased to 27. 5 from 23. 2 mm.

Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting: University-affiliated medical center. Methods: The charts and photographs of patients suffering from columellar retraction with acute columellar-labial angle were reviewed. The columellar-labial angle and the nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> were measured and calculated from the photos and the columellar show was measured using a fine caliper. Results: The study included 17 patients, 12 females and 5 males {{with a mean age of}} 30. 2 years ranging from 19 to 49 years, 14 patients had primary surgery while 3 were revision cases, Preoperative columellar-labial angle ranged from 75 ° to 86 ° with a mean 82. 06 ± 4. 08458 SD, while postoperatively it ranged from 92 ° to 105 ° with a mean 97. 12 °± 3. 9825 SD. Columellar show ranged preoperatively from 0. 4 to 1. 7 mm with a mean 0. 94 mm± 0. 38739 SD while postoperatively it ranged from 2. 5 to 3. 5 mm with a mean of 2. 65 mm± 0. 38098 SD.

30|$|We chose classic {{surgical}} methods {{with which}} to contour the nasal base, which is well embodied in the corresponding proportion indices. In the surgical group, {{the change in the}} nasal base shape between the preoperative and postoperative period is related to the change in the supporting structure. The domal stabilization suture provides a method {{with which to}} unify, align, and stabilize the individual domal segments (Corrado et al. 2009). Transdomal suturing decreases the width of the dome arch and provides a small amount of projection from each side dome (Wang et al. 2009). It decreases the domal distance, narrows the nasal tip, strengthens the upward support, and increases the tip support. Autogenous cartilages are transplanted to the tip as onlay grafts create a more projecting and natural tip contour. This increases the nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection.</b> Autogenous cartilage is transplanted between the medial crura and sutured together as a columellar strut, which adds the columellar length and provides support strength along the columella (Wang et al. 2009). Addition of medial crural support along the struts is commonly applied to increase <b>tip</b> <b>projection,</b> enhance tip strength, and correct buckling of the intermediate and medial crura (Kal et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Rhinoplasty {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{complicated}} aesthetic surgeries.

A questionnaire was designed for rating the pictures. Questionnaires were filled in by 3 different groups: rhinoplasty surgeons, general people, and artists. A total of 73 questionnaires were filled in. The analysis and comparison were done. Crumley 2 is the best NTP measurement method from the surgeons’ and artists’ view. Goode is the method preferred by general people. Powell & Humphreys method seems to be the worst method from all 3 groups’ view.

Traditionally, rhinoseptoplasty for nasal bone frac-ture is only considered after an unsatisfactory outcome from initial closed reduction. However, better surgical out-comes may be achieved if rhinoseptoplasty is performed at the same time as the nasal bone fracture reduction. This study investigated the surgical outcomes of patients who underwent rhinoseptoplasty concomitantly with nasal bone fracture reduction according to their computed tomography image-based nasal bone fracture classifications. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Academic tertiary care medical center. Subjects and Methods. Fifty-six patients who underwent rhi-noseptoplasty concomitantly with nasal bone fracture reduc-tion were enrolled in this study. Nasal bone fractures were classified into 6 types by computed tomography scans. Two independent facial plastic surgeons evaluated the outcomes 6 months postoperatively using a visual analog scale. The nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> and rotation were measured using the pre- and postoperative profile views. Results. The satisfaction scores of type I, IIo, and IIIo frac-tures without septal fracture were significantly higher than those of type II, III, and IV fractures with septal fractures.

INTERVENTION: The nasal septa of 6 children {{with a history of}} nasal septal abscess and partial or complete destruction of nasal septal cartilage were reconstructed with autologous cartilage grafts of the auricle or rib fixed on polydioxanone plate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nasal outgrowth was measured by the length of the nose and by the amount of nasal <b>tip</b> <b>projection</b> and was compared with standardized growth curves. Aesthetic outcome variables included nasolabial angle, columellar retraction, and development of saddle nose deformity and were classified as normal, mild, or severe. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up ranged from 10 to 68 months (mean follow-up, 38 months). Four children had complete loss of the cartilaginous septum.
