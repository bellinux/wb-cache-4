5|$|In 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation {{initiated}} a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its {{goal was to}} renovate and restore the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area {{to the left of}} worshipers facing <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} season's {{southern}} scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the Vatnajökull glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik on Höfðabrekkuheiði.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the perfect game, a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch at <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Mike Redmond grounded out to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a soft ground ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had to range far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe grounded out to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places {{by the end of}} lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{returned}} to green flag conditions on lap 26, de Silvestro held the lead ahead of Franchitti, Hunter-Reay and Kanaan with Tagliani in fifth position. De Silvestro {{kept the lead}} for a further two laps, with Hunter-Reay's Andretti Autosport car moving ahead of Franchitti on lap 27, repeating his move on Tagliani on the defending series champion. Not long after, Hunter-Reay moved ahead of de Silvestro as the pair were under braking for turn five. Hunter-Reay nearly lost control of his car as his car bottomed out on the straight, with lifted the car slightly airborne. Franchitti further demoted the young Swiss driver to third, moving ahead on lap 29. Behind them, Hideki Mutoh hit Vitor Meira which saw his retirement from the race, and Wheldon hit the back of Tagliani which sent him into Kanaan, resulting in the retirement of the Canadian driver. Rain started falling once again, more heavily than before {{and much of the}} field pitted to change from dry-weather tyres to wet-weather ones. Alex Lloyd aquaplaned into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second Dale Coyne car, bringing out the caution for the third time, and with rain falling relentlessly, series officials brought out the red flag to allow the weather conditions to pass. After a 36-minute red flag delay, cars returned to the circuit with slicks being the choice of tyre for the track, despite a few wet patches remaining on the circuit. Some cars gambled on wets thinking that the circuit would not dry quickly enough for their tyres to drop off compared to the slicks.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2008, {{a tractor}} trailer {{involved}} in a head-on collision near the west end fell from the bridge; the driver died in the crash. The incident has highlighted concern that the bridge may not be structurally safe, but the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) has discounted any structural or engineering problems with it. Inspections of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weeks following the accident revealed that there was deterioration {{in the form of}} corrosion of the steel reinforcements inside barriers; this prompted immediate repairs to the wall.|$|E
50|$|After {{the city}} fire of 1891, the {{south-western}} tower {{and parts of}} <b>the</b> western <b>wall</b> of <b>the</b> castle were torn down to provide stone for repairing fire-damaged houses.

5|$|A {{distinct}} feature noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire temple {{complex is}} the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry {{and finished with}} plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>the</b> niches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on <b>the</b> outer <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> temple have since been demolished.|$|R
50|$|After {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Prague went through {{tremendous}} growth. Construction near Prague’s city walls, however, was discouraged by the military administration, which enforced the demolition of buildings close to the fortifications because they threatened to allow a breach of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of war. After Austria’s defeat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prague was declared an open city and, after lengthy negotiations, the municipality of Prague began with <b>the</b> cutting of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> 1874. <b>The</b> area near Vitkov received the majority of the railways, allowing the smooth connection of Prague and Žižkov.|$|R
25|$|In the {{background}} of the series, the Children of the Forest fought a series of wars against the First Men (a civilization of primitive warriors wielding bronze weapons and riding horses), until the Pact of the Isle of Faces, wherein the First Men obtained control of the open lands and the Children that of the forests. The Pact was weakened after four thousand years by the emergence of the Others, who were vanquished by the combined use of obsidian, fire, the magic of the old gods, and the building of <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following centuries the Children gradually disappeared, and it was presumed that they left Westeros or became extinct. Little of their legacy is present in the series beyond their worship of nameless gods, still practiced by some in the North, and the remaining Weirwoods through which the Children communicated telepathically.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} game, the Dodgers took a 6–1 lead, thanks to A. J. Ellis who had four hits, {{including}} a home run. Clayton Kershaw, who only allowed two {{hits in the}} first six innings (two solo homers), hit <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventh. The Cardinals loaded the bases on three singles and then Matt Carpenter cleared the bases with a double to give the Cardinals the lead. A three-run home run by Matt Holliday off relief pitcher Pedro Báez put the game away, though the Dodgers did mount a rally to make the final score 10–9. Kershaw with 10 strikeouts joined Sandy Koufax as the only Dodgers in history with multiple 10 strikeout games in the post-season, though he was also the first pitcher in history to allow eight runs while striking out 10.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldinho scored {{his first}} goal for Flamengo in the 3–2 victory against Boavista on 6 February 2011. On 27 February, he {{converted}} a second-half free kick for Flamengo to beat Boavista 1–0 and win his {{first piece of}} silverware with the team, the Taça Guanabara. Ronaldinho lifted his first trophy with Flamengo after curling in a right-footed shot over <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 71st minute at Engenhão stadium. The goal gave Flamengo its 19th Taça Guanabara title, which earned the Campeonato Carioca title two months later, as the team also won the Taça Rio. On 27 July 2011, Ronaldinho scored a hat-trick in Flamengo's 5–4 away win against rivals Santos, after being 3–0 down inside the first 30 minutes. On 31 May 2012, after being absent for a few days, he sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and cancelled his contract with the club.|$|E

25|$|The mastaba of Mereruka is {{the largest}} and most {{elaborate}} of all the non-royal tombs in Saqqara with 33 rooms or chambers in total. Mereruka was the vizier to king Teti, who was the first pharaoh of the 6th dynasty Old Kingdom period of Egypt. Mereruka was married to Teti's daughter, princess Seshseshet Waatetkhethor. He was, therefore, the king's son-in-law. Princess Seshseshet Waatetkhethor is buried in Mereruka's mastaba tomb along with their son, Meriteti. The paintings on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the tomb show Mereruka painting the seasons and playing a board game. The first three chambers are decorated with scenes of furniture making, hunting and goldsmith working. A lifelike statue of Mereruka was found intact within the principal chamber {{at the far end of}} his mastaba tomb. This chamber is approached through the mastaba tomb's false door. Mereruka's mastaba tomb boasts vibrant and well preserved tomb decorations and numerous relief scenes. His mastaba tomb remained hidden from view until it was discovered and excavated by Jacques de Morgan, of the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1892. However, the first major publication on his tomb did not occur until over 40 years later in 1936 by Prentice Duell. Mereruka was also known by his 'beautiful' or chosen name of Meri.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{wings of}} almost equal size, one {{on either side}} of a central wash, which runs from east to west. The houses inside <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} half run roughly parallel with the wall, with a single exception near the east. The houses on the southern half, however, were constructed at right angles to the wall. This was due to the geographical conditions: the rooms to the south are situated on two long ridges, while those to the north are also built on high ground which runs along the wall. There are only three entrances to the pueblo's interior: one just south of the east end of the arroyo, one near the northeastern corner, and the third in the north wall. While there might have been additional entrances, the current ruins do not indicate their existence. The site was populated for a significant amount of time, as evidenced by the large refuse heap to the south. The pueblo was self-contained, with no significant structures outside the wall. To the north there are rectangles which indicate a graveyard. It is built in the Chacoan style of pueblo, covering approximately 30 acres, {{making it one of the}} largest pueblo sites in the southwest.|$|E
25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
