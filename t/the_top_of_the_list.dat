Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E

Bradford won the trophy with 1,726 total points, and McCoy finished second with 1,604 points in the Heisman voting.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} was {{signed and dated}} at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of signatories was Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem. He {{was followed by the}} four earls Lincoln, Pembroke, Surrey and Hereford, and five men of baronial families: Clifford, Payn Tybetot, Henry de Gray, John de Botetourt and John de Berwick. The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as a transcript made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale. Dugdale's transcript is believed to be based on an older document, which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731.|$|E

5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and Burt Reynolds. Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> {{in the event that}} Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E
