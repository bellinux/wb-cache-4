40|$|Abstract Aims: Cross-{{training}} is {{the process}} whereby training of one limb gives rise to enhancements {{in the performance of}} <b>the</b> opposite, <b>untrained</b> limb and may be dependent on type of muscle contractions performed. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether unilateral resistance training using eccentric contraction is more effective than concentric resistance training to improve time to task failure in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>untrained</b> limb. Methods:Subjects completed 12 weeks of resistance training consisting of 36 sessions, using unilateral leg exercise. Sustained isometric knee extension performed at 50 % of maxmal force until task failure for <b>the</b> contralateral <b>untrained</b> leg. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals were simultaneously recorded from contralateral untrained quadriceps (vastusmedialis, rectus femoris, and vastuslateralis). Results: Time to task failure of the contralateraluntrained leg and associated EMG activitiessignificantly increased after 12 weeks ofunilateral resistance training(p< 0. 05). However, percent increase in time to task failure and EMG amplitude after eccentric resistance training was significantly higher than concentric resistance training (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study concluded that unilateral eccentric resistancetraining is superior to concentric resistance training to increase time to task failure in <b>the</b> contralateral <b>untrained</b> limb...|$|R

In one study, 10% of participants showed no benefit after completing a 20-week conditioning program, although the other 90% of the test subjects all showed substantial improvements in fitness to varying degree.|$|R

40|$|Background: Cross-{{training}} is {{the process}} whereby training of one limb gives rise to enhancements {{in the performance of}} <b>the</b> opposite, <b>untrained</b> limb, most likely due to neural adaptations {{at the level of the}} motor cortex and/or spinal cord. Objective: To investigate whether unilateral resistance training can affect <b>the</b> ability of <b>untrained</b> homologous muscle in the contralateral limb to maintain force output over a sustained contraction. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects completed 12 weeks of resistance training consisting of 36 sessions, using the unilateral leg press exercise. Sustained isometric knee extension performed at 50 % of maximal force until task failure on both the ipsilateral trained leg and contralateral untrained leg. Surface electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the trained and contralateral untrained quadriceps (vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis). Results: Time to task failure of <b>the</b> contralateral <b>untrained</b> leg was significantly increased after 12 weeks of unilateral resistance training (p <. 05). Moreover, the EMG amplitude of <b>the</b> contralateral <b>untrained</b> quadriceps was significantly higher during the post training sustained contractions with respect to pre training condition (p <. 05).

25|$|To <b>the</b> <b>untrained</b> eye, these mites are {{generally}} not a very noticeable problem for a strongly growing hive- as the bees may appear strong in number, and may even be very effective at foraging. However, the mite reproduction cycle occurs inside the capped pupae, and the mite population can surge {{as a result of}} colony growth. Careful observation of a colony can help identify signs of disease often spread by mites. When the hive population growth is reduced in preparation for winter or due to poor late summer forage, the mite population growth can overtake that of the bees and can then destroy the hive. It has been observed diseased colonies my slowly die off and be unable to survive through winter even when adequate food stores are present. Often a colony will simply abscond (leave as in a swarm, but leaving no population behind) under such conditions.|$|E

25|$|Generally, in {{the early}} stages of drowning, very little water enters the lungs: a small amount of water {{entering}} the trachea causes a muscular spasm that seals the airway and prevents the passage of both air and water until unconsciousness occurs. This means a person drowning is unable to shout or call for help, or seek attention, as they cannot obtain enough air. The instinctive drowning response is the final set of autonomic reactions in the 20–60 seconds before sinking underwater, and to <b>the</b> <b>untrained</b> eye can look similar to calm safe behavior. Lifeguards and other persons trained in rescue learn to recognize drowning people by watching for these movements. If the process is not interrupted, loss of consciousness due to hypoxia is followed rapidly by cardiac arrest. At this stage, the process is still usually reversible by prompt and effective rescue and first aid. Survival rates depend strongly on the duration of immersion.|$|E
25|$|Cassiodorus devoted much of {{his life}} to {{supporting}} education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted. His Variae show that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, which <b>the</b> <b>untrained</b> reader would need to begin with because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods. By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it is fair to assess that as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they appear}} to be similar to <b>the</b> <b>untrained</b> eye, crocodiles, {{alligators}} and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that age-related behavioral alterations are not irreversible but are subject to amelioration through specific training interventions. Both training paradigms and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can be used to modulate age-related brain alterations and thereby influence behavior. It has been shown that mirror visual feedback (MVF) during motor skill training improves performance of <b>the</b> trained and <b>untrained</b> hands in young adults. The question remains of whether MVF also improves motor performance in older adults and how performance improvements can be optimised via NIBS. Here, we sought to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can be used to augment MVF-induced performance improvements in manual dexterity. We found that older adults receiving a-tDCS over the right primary motor cortex (M 1) during MVF showed superior performance improvements of <b>the</b> (left) <b>untrained</b> hand relative to sham stimulation. An additional control experiment in participants receiving a-tDCS over the right M 1 only (without MVF/motor training of the right hand) revealed no significant behavioral gains in <b>the</b> left (<b>untrained)</b> hand. On <b>the</b> basis of these findings, we propose that combining a-tDCS with MVF might be relevant for future clinical studies that aim to optimise the outcome of neurorehabilitation...|$|R

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} Æthelstan’s reign and in {{the time}} of his successors Edmund, Eadred, Eadwig and the first part of Edgar’s reign, the coinage was of a regionalised character, with up to seven regions of {{monetary}} circulation. The structure of this system is clearest for northern England thanks to the discovery of more numerous hoards {{in that part of the}} country. Coins normally stayed within their area of production, and different types were current in each region. However, these regions were not static, and many of the 'regional' types were, to <b>the</b> <b>untrained</b> eye, comparatively similar. The predominant type bore the king's name in circumscription on the obverse (normally around a small cross), and the moneyer's name in two lines with various ornaments on the reverse. At various times a circumscription reverse was also used, which gave scope for a longer legend; or a portrait obverse. For reasons unknown, East Anglia in particular favoured royal portraits between the 930s and 970s, though it was also used sporadically elsewhere. Mints are not normally named, but it is usually possible to attribute coins to their region of origin. However, despite the regionalised types and circulation of coinage, pennies remained of relatively stable size, weight and fineness, and most importantly were always struck in the name of the West Saxon king. Even when the kingdom was divided between Eadwig and Edgar in 957, coinage seems to have remained the preserve of Eadwig, the senior partner in rule, even in the mint towns ruled by Edgar.|$|E
