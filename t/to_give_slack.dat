50|$|To {{control the}} kite, the pilot pulls {{on the right}} hand line to turn right, left line to turn left, and so on. The pitch can {{sometimes}} be controlled by walking/running forward or backwards, giving the lines different amounts of tension. Using a combination of pulls and pushes (<b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>slack</b> to the lines), complex tricks and patterns can be flown. These range in difficulty from turns, loops and landings, to maneuvers where the kite is flipped and turned end over end, wrapping the lines or floating on its front or back. During diving maneuvers sport kites may reach speeds of 60 mph, while in stall type maneuvers they can remain nearly motionless. This type of stall allows for various other acrobatic maneuvers to be performed.|$|E
50|$|Weak {{spots in}} the line {{can be caused by}} making the circle around the counter wheel, making a bend around a sheave, a kink in a line from normal use (when rigging up the {{equipment}} extra line must be pulled out from the truck <b>to</b> <b>give</b> enough <b>slack</b> when the pressure control lubricator is picked up - this leaves line coiled on the often rutted ground, and sometimes it snags and kinks the line).|$|R
50|$|Yates {{proceeded}} to lower Simpson off the North Ridge by tying two 150-foot lengths of rope {{together to make}} one 300-foot rope. However, because the two ropes were tied together, the knot couldn't go through the belay plate. Simpson would have to stand on his good (left) leg <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Yates enough <b>slack</b> <b>to</b> unclip the rope, in order to thread the rope back through the lowering device with the knot on the other side. With storm conditions worsening and darkness upon them, Yates inadvertently lowered Simpson off a cliff. Because Yates was sitting higher up the mountain, {{he could not see}} nor hear Simpson; he could only feel that Simpson had all his weight on the rope. Simpson attempted to ascend the rope using a Prusik knot. However, because his hands were badly frostbitten, he was unable to tie the knots properly and accidentally dropped one of the cords required to ascend the rope.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{a number}} of ethical issues {{that need to be}} {{addressed}} appropriately if real-‐world economics is to achieve a larger and enduring presence in the economics classroom. Attention is <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the <b>slack</b> permitted by the ambiguity of course descriptions and the possibility that this will end up being used to the benefit of the academic economist rather than result in the cause of real-‐world economics being pursued as vigorously as it might have been. Processes that operate to remove cognitive dissonance mean that economists are likely to be able to rationalise behaviour that short-‐changes real-‐ world economics as being ethically acceptable. The paper therefore concludes that a charter specifying appropriate behaviour is needed. The paper also examines ethical issues involved in attracting students to courses that take a real-‐world perspective, and the potential for including ethical perspectives in economics teaching and thereby promoting behaviour that is more socially an...|$|R
2500|$|By 1956, Jake and {{his family}} have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been {{planning}} since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the cops if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him, but is elusive. Returning to the opening scene in 1964, Jake refers to the [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront starring Marlon Brando, complaining that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough <b>to</b> <b>give</b> himself some <b>slack.</b> After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant [...] "I'm the boss" [...] while shadowboxing.|$|R
40|$|Because {{compensation}} {{figures for}} public firms are {{more readily available}} than for private, most scholars of executive compensation have focused on publicly traded companies. Some have attributed the recent increase in compensation levels at those firms <b>to</b> agency <b>slack.</b> <b>Given</b> that owners of private firms face fewer collective action problems than their peers at public firms, one might plausibly reason that any such slack should be lower at private firms. In turn, {{the contrast between the}} executive compensation practices at public and private firms could then clarify the extent (if any) to which collective action problems contribute to the current high compensation levels. Although Japanese securities law does not mandate the disclosure of executive compensation practices at either public or private firms, through 2004 the tax office published the names and tax liabilities of all individuals paying at least about $ 100, 000 in taxes. We match this tax data with rosters of about 1400 presidents of public and 4100 presidents of private corporations. We find that public and private firms pay their presidents at similar levels. Both groups of presidents earn incomes that rise with the siz...|$|R

If performed at design time, such a result can be used to adjust the system design by <b>giving</b> more <b>slack</b> <b>to</b> the limiting task.

40|$|ABSTRACT—In this paper, we are {{interested}} in resource allocation for energy constrained and security-critical embedded systems. Tasks in such systems need to be successfully executed under certain energy budget and be robust against serious security threatens. Different to former energy minimal scheduling problem, we introduce a new optimization problem for a set of tasks with energy constraint and multiple security choices. We present a dynamic programming based approximation algorithm to minimize the security risk of the system while statistically guaranteeing energy consumption constraints for <b>given</b> energy <b>slack</b> ratio. The proposed algorithm is very efficient in both time and space dimensions, and achieves good solutions. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over other approaches.
