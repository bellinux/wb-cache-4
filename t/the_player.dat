5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> confronts Camoran and kills him. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to <b>the</b> <b>player</b> and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks <b>the</b> <b>player</b> for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E
5|$|A stealth {{game is a}} type {{of video}} game that tasks <b>the</b> <b>player</b> with using stealth to avoid or {{overcome}} antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to remain undetected by hiding, using disguises or avoiding noise. Some games allow <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but mostly rewarding <b>the</b> <b>player</b> for greater levels of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, and assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and even platformers.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide <b>the</b> <b>player</b> through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E

5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As <b>the</b> <b>player</b> progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching <b>the</b> <b>player</b> the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{a portion of}} the mountain, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free.

5|$|After {{reaching}} the next city, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> {{is asked to}} deliver a parcel to Professor Oak.

This continues until <b>the</b> <b>player</b> stops or {{the target is}} dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by <b>the</b> <b>player</b> during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight.

When <b>the</b> <b>player</b> finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the only human left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks <b>the</b> <b>player</b> for helping realize his mistake {{about the nature of the}} relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel in which <b>the</b> <b>player</b> assumes {{the role of}} three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that <b>the</b> <b>player</b> makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake.

5|$|Alien: Isolation is a single-player action-adventure {{game with}} heavy {{emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror features. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> controls the protagonist, Amanda Ripley, from a first-person perspective {{to interact with the}} environment. To advance through the game, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must explore a space station and complete numerous objectives while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating enemies. Objectives range from activating computers to collecting certain items or reaching a specific area in the game. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> has the ability to run, climb ladders, and sneak into vents. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can also crouch and hide behind objects to break the line of sight with enemies, and covertly peek over or lean around to gain view. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> also has the ability to go under nearby tables or inside lockers to hide from enemies.|$|E
5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> with limited ammunition. Fortunately, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help <b>the</b> <b>player</b> deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> with limited ammunition. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> has {{a limited amount}} of health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect <b>the</b> <b>player</b> with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt <b>the</b> <b>player</b> by sight or sound. Along the way, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> controls the movement of <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where <b>the</b> <b>player</b> loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character will die. Armor lessens the impact to <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character's health from hostile action, but once depleted <b>the</b> <b>player</b> will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Anita and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> {{get drunk}} {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads <b>the</b> <b>player</b> into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{includes}} additional {{modes of}} play that display elements {{not seen in}} the game's primary scenario. The New Game+ option allows a player that has completed the game to replay the game with all equipment and souls <b>the</b> <b>player</b> had acquired in a previous file. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can opt to start the game in Hard Mode, offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level. Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay. Boss Rush mode involves <b>the</b> <b>player</b> facing all of the game's bosses in quick succession, and is unlocked after <b>the</b> <b>player</b> completes the game once. Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> takes control of , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which <b>the</b> <b>player</b> uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack <b>the</b> <b>player</b> in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are inefficient in spotting <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E
