5|$|After the war, Clarke had {{a varied}} {{military}} career {{that began with}} a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat. While on extended leave in Turkey in 1922, he {{became involved in the}} Chanak Crisis, a threatened Turkish attack on British and French troops. Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a first taste of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif War for the Morning Post.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club made use of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> became {{synonymous with}} Belle Vue was {{speedway}} (known {{at the time}} as dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the Belle Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} music festivals in Miri, namely Borneo Jazz Festival, Asia Music Festival (AMF) and Miri Country Music Fest (MCMF). Borneo Jazz Festival {{was started in}} 2006. It is a 2-night festival of 4 {{performances}} in each night by local and international jazz musicians at Parkcity Everly hotel, Miri. Asia Music Festival is also a 2-day event featuring artists and musicians from Asian countries such as India, Taiwan, Philippines, and Indonesia. It was first held in 2013 at Eastwood Valley Golf and Country Club, about 5km from the city centre. It attracts about 4,000 music lovers attending the event. Miri Country Music Fest (MCMF) is a one-day event introduced in 2014, held at Parkcity Everly Hotel, Miri. Among <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> can be found here are music and dance workshop, and night concert featuring country music bands {{from all over the}} world. Stalls selling food items, games, and souvenir items are also available.|$|E

25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end.

25|$|A tax {{effectively}} changes relative {{prices of}} products. Therefore, most economists, especially neoclassical economists, argue that taxation creates market distortion {{and results in}} economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or negative) externalities associated with <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> are taxed {{that need to be}} internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.|$|E

25|$|In February 1841, Young died {{without any}} known heir {{and without a}} will. This created a need for some form of probate court {{to deal with his}} estate, which had many debtors and {{creditors}} among the settlers. Doctor Ira L. Babcock was selected as supreme judge with probate powers to deal with Young's estate. <b>The</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> followed his death eventually {{led to the creation of}} a provisional government in the Oregon Country.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} its own chapel, but only {{fragments}} of the facade remain in the structure today. One room that survives nearly intact is the music room. In the 19th century, music was one of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> the upper-class engaged in on a daily basis. European composers such as Franz Schubert, Chopin, Beethoven and Liszt were preferred but music by Mexican composers such as Tomás León, Aniceto Ortega and Melesio Morales could be played as well. Music rooms were considered important during that time period to show {{the culture of the}} family.|$|E
25|$|The major {{complaints}} against the area {{within the community}} were primarily against the dance halls and brothels, which reformers saw as the most immoral, {{as well as the}} general violence. The saloons and gambling halls were generally less of a concern. In 1889, following serious bouts of violence in the city, officials shut down many of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> were deemed as most directly contributing to the violence. By the start of the 20th century, the Acre's popularity as a destination for out-of-town visitors had diminished dramatically. The Progressive movement of the early 20th century put increasing pressure on the area until it was shut down in 1917.|$|E

25|$|Cloisters {{provided}} special accommodation for <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> {{took place}} within it: stone benches {{were used for}} reading, books were sometimes stored in cupboards or armoires built into the walls. In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the Classical period, such as vine scrolls and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.|$|E
25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> {{are going to be}} assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E
25|$|Both {{male and}} female D. melanogaster act polygamously (having {{multiple}} sexual partners at the same time). In both males and females, polygamy results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies, more so in males than females. Evening activity consists of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> the flies participate in other than mating and finding partners, such as finding food. The reproductive success {{of males and females}} varies, {{due to the fact that}} a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility. Mating with multiple partners provides no advantage over mating with one partner, and therefore females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals. For males, however, mating with multiple partners increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring. This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment.|$|E
