5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> (that is, the full marginal social costs of <b>their</b> <b>actions).</b> Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of <b>their</b> <b>actions.</b> This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E

Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared <b>their</b> <b>actions</b> unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention.

He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E

40|$|When {{infected}} with the filamentous phage f 1, Escherichia coli K- 12 strains are 20 - to 40 -times more resistant to colicins K and E 3 than are uninfected cells. The colicins are adsorbed normally and are blocked in <b>their</b> <b>action</b> at some subsequent stage of <b>their</b> <b>action.</b> Productive infection of virions is not necessary for induction of resistance. The evidence presented implicates the product of gene III of the phage, a minor protein in the virion, as being responsible for this resistance. The simplest interpretation of the results is that this gene product blocks the penetration of colicins which is necessary for <b>their</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
