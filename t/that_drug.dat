5|$|In January 2013 Goldacre {{joined the}} Cochrane Collaboration, British Medical Journal {{and others in}} setting up AllTrials, a {{campaign}} calling {{for the results of}} all past and current clinical trials to be reported. The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee expressed concern in January 2014 <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> companies were still only publishing around 50 percent of clinical-trial results.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{addiction}} medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.|$|E

5|$|Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. They believe that the bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves {{to be an expert}} on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head the night before the murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

25|$|Reporting on the {{activities}} of drug trafficking organizations in China is sparse.

25|$|The Colombian Supreme Court {{has ruled}} <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> {{trafficking}} is a related offence to rebellion, {{as long as}} this activity was conducted to finance the insurgency. The inclusion of drug trafficking has generated significant controversy in Colombia. The government, pro-government legislators, the Ombudsman and the then-attorney general supported the inclusion of drug trafficking as a related offence, arguing that it was used to finance the rebellion. Senator Álvaro Uribe and inspector general Alejandro Ordóñez have strongly opposed its inclusion as a related offence, with Uribe stating <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> trafficking was tied to terrorism rather than political ends.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other studies}} have {{supported}} the value of physical activity and dietary modifications to treat metabolic syndrome. Some natural compounds, like ursolic acid, have been suggested {{as a treatment for}} obesity/metabolic syndrome {{based on the results of}} extensive research involving animal models; it is argued, however, that there is still a lack of data regarding the use of ursolic acid in humans, as phase-II/III trials of <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> have not been carried so far.|$|E

Out {{of the total}} 215 drugs prescribed, majority were from Category A(70. 2 %) followed by Category B(18. 6 %),Category C(8. 8 %),Category-X(1. 3 %) and Category-D(0. 9 %). 26. 6 % women believed <b>that</b> <b>drugs</b> used during pregnancy can be dangerous to both mother and fetus; 55 % believed it is dangerous to fetus alone and 1. 6 % believed it is dangerous to mother alone. But 16. 6 % women believed <b>that</b> <b>drugs</b> are safe to both mother and fetus. |$|R

25|$|Benzodiazepines {{have been}} abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have {{different}} abuse potential; the more rapid {{the increase in the}} plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E
25|$|Substance {{abuse is}} often {{correlated}} with panic attacks. The majority of individuals {{participating in a}} study determined (63%) of those abusing alcohol reported that alcohol use began prior to the onset of panic, and the majority (59%) of those abusing illicit drugs reported <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> use began first. The study that was conducted documented the panic-substance abuse relationship. Substance abuse began prior to onset of panic and substances were used to self-medicate for panic attacks by only a few subjects.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide {{should be}} used with caution when {{combined}} with corticosteroids (as this {{increases the risk of}} electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthesics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with <b>that</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2001 SLaM sought {{planning}} permission for an expanded Medium Secure Unit in 2001 and extensive works to improve security, {{much of which}} would be on Metropolitan Open Land. Local residents' groups organised mass meetings to oppose the application, with accusations that it was unfair that most patients could be from inner London areas and therefore not locals and <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> use was rife in and around the hospital. Bromley Council refused the application, with Croydon Council also objecting. However the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister overturned the decision in 2003 and development started.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} local police {{departments}} D.A.R.E. programs have police cars marked as DARE cars to promote their program. The D.A.R.E. cars appear at schools and in parades. Typically these cars are high-end or performance cars that have been seized in a drug raid. They are used to send the message <b>that</b> <b>drug</b> dealers forfeit all their glamorous trappings when they get caught. D.A.R.E. cars can also be regular police vehicles that are {{nearing the end of}} their service life, pressed into service for the promotion, or new police cars outfitted especially for the D.A.R.E. program.|$|E
