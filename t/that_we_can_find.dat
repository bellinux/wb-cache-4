500|$|A broken china plate {{bearing the}} name of Zhiyuan was found, which helped to {{identify}} the vessel. Naval historian Chen Yue {{stressed the importance of}} finding common living items to those researching the Sino-Japanese War and expressed a high hope of discovering the official seal of the vessel. He said, [...] "The ship seal was invariably made of good materials and stored in a sturdy box. It is highly possible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it." [...] During the excavation, the bodies of seven of the crew were recovered. The idea of floating the wreck were initially discounted due to the risk of structural collapse, but plans to raise the vessel have not yet been finalised. It is intended for the artifacts to be displayed at a new museum, located in nearby Dandong.|$|E

We can then call a subset U of FS recursive (respectively recursively enumerable) if f(U) is recursive (respectively recursively enumerable). If S is indexed as above and R recursively enumerable, then the presentation is a recursive presentation and the corresponding group is recursively presented. This usage may seem odd, but it is possible to prove that if a group has a presentation with R recursively enumerable then it has another one with R recursive.|$|E

[...] In this document are set out the present limits of the territory: Perafita, Pic Joan and Pic de Querroig. [...] This fiefdom, called la vall de Cervera, included a castle (the Querroig tower is the only remnant) and a church dedicated to Christ the Saviour, built at the foot of the Pic de Querroig and mentioned in the 14th century. [...] It is only from the fourteenth century <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> evidence to give a vague idea of the history of Cerbère. The place was attached to Abeilles, creating a single seigneurie (manor), of which Dominique Isern, from Rigarda, was owner at the end of the Ancien Régime.

2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{inference}} could {{be represented by}} a purely mechanical process is found as early as Raymond Llull, who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings. [...] The work of logicians such as the Oxford Calculators led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (calculationes) in words, a method used, for instance, in the Logica magna by Paul of Venice. [...] Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician Thomas Hobbes suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction. The same idea {{is found in the}} work of Leibniz, who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus. [...] But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to [...] "countless ambiguities" [...] and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words; hence, he proposed to identify an alphabet of human thought comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas, and create a calculus ratiocinator that would make all arguments [...] "as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate." ...|$|E

This {{marks the first}} time an honor of this kind has been bestowed upon a rap artist. Chamillionaire hopes that this pivotal new role will allow him to help usher in the next generation of tech entrepreneurs as well as continue to offer valuable advice and investment capital to worthy start-ups. A spokesperson for Upfront Ventures has stated that; [...] "Chamillionaire brings a wealth of expertise in this area to the table based on his own years of employing successful tech and marketing strategies as both an independent music artist and later a label partner with Universal Records. Add to that he has quietly been a fixture in the tech world for many years: attending major conferences both as a keynote and audience member, making him a sought-after promotional partner, advisor and potential investor. It was in this capacity that he met Upfront partner, Mark Suster, in 2009, becoming one of the earliest co-investors in Maker Studios, now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company." [...] In a letter penned by Mark Suster explaining the week he's had at Upfront Ventures in Los Angeles, he explains the presence of Chamillionaire around the office. [...] "The same Chamillionaire who was showing us how to get our respective shines on not a decade ago. But if Kanye has taught us anything, it's <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> success in multiple creative outlets.
