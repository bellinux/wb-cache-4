40|$|A Geographical Education Magazine article. The {{need for}} safe and {{adequate}} water by {{all human beings}} is well recognized. However, a close examination o-f the accessibility, adequacy {{and the quality of}} water for the people of developing countries reveals a very sad story. In 1980 it was estimated that about 70 % of the people in developing countries had no reasonable access to safe and adequate water supply. This means that even today, over half of humankind lacks one of the basic requirements for life. The term "reasonable access" means that a disproportionate time of those who draw water should not be spent fetching water, and "safe water‚Äù should be free of pathogens. Having realized the plight of the rural population in developing countries, the world community through the United Nations in 1970 aimed at providing reasonably accessible and safe water to 25 % of the rural population by 1980. In 1978 the UN Conference on Water emphasized the importance of safe water supply and sanitation in controlling diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, infectious hepatitis, etc. During the <b>thirty-fifth</b> <b>session</b> of the UN General Assembly in November 1980, the period 1981 - 1990 was declared the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (IDWSSD).

40|$|The {{document}} which ECLAC presents on {{this occasion}} explores further the theme of equality addressed at the two previous sessions of the Commission, in Time for Equality: Closing Gaps, Opening Trails (2010, Brasilia), and Structural Change for Equality: An Integrated Approach to Development (2012, San Salvador). The document prepared for the <b>thirty-fifth</b> <b>session,</b> entitled Compacts for Equality: Towards a Sustainable Future, discusses the two major challenges to development in Latin America and the Caribbean today: to achieve greater equality and to make development sustainable for future generations. The various chapters examine the social, economic, environmental and natural resource governance constraints on sustainability, {{as well as the}} challenges associated with strategic development options. They also further explore the equality approach developed by ECLAC at previous sessions, treating the world of work as a key arena. Consumption is analysed {{as it relates to the}} economic, social and environmental spheres, highlighting its potential to increase well-being as well as its problematic externalities in terms of environmental sustainability, the fiscal covenant and the production structure, among others. The dynamics existing between production structures and institutions are explored, drawing attention to ways in which the efficient organization of institutions can help to maximize contributions to development. The document concludes with a set of medium- and long-term policy proposals that need to be enshrined in social covenants and policy instruments for implementing, in a democratic context, the policies and institutional reforms that the Latin American and Caribbean countries need to resolve the dilemmas they face at the current crossroads.
