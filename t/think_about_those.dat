To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. <b>Think</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> plastic single-use water bottles.

50|$|Unlike advocates, {{journalists are}} not {{supposed}} to persuade but to report. It is inappropriate for them to use these insights to manipulate their audience but, in order to make their stories relevant narratives include not just the facts, but also how people feel about the risks presented and why. In essence, they report two dimensions of the risk story—the physical narrative of global warming, and the psychological subtext that discusses how the public <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> risks. Journalists, of course, should avoid distorting the science, but getting to the heart of risk tales involves something more: in sum it requires not only understanding the objective facts of the danger, but also navigating the way their audience feels about the risk issue, while telling an accurate story.|$|R

It is the quintessential honky-tonk steel sound — tuneful, aggressive, full of attitude.” Lloyd also credits Helms' sound as a major influence in shifting the sound of country music away from the hillbilly string-band sound popular in the 1930s and toward the more modern electric style that became prominent in the 1940s.|$|R

40|$|Rates {{of suicide}} amongst {{young people with}} a first episode of {{psychosis}} are significantly {{higher than those of}} the general population. Psychological theory demonstrates that protective and moderating factors that buffer risk against suicidality are important for understanding why people <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> attempt and are successful at killing themselves. A literature review was conducted to identify the factors that reduce the risk of suicidality specific to people experiencing psychosis. Positive self­ appraisals, social support, daily activities, coping, negative symptoms of psychosis, and low IQ were found to protect against suicide amongst people with psychosis. An empirical study was then conducted to investigate whether the moderators (i. e. thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness and acquired capability) outlined in the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory can distinguish between young people with a first episode of psychosis who <b>think</b> <b>about</b> suicide and <b>those</b> who attempt suicide (N= 45) using self-report measures. The concepts of the Interpersonal­ Psychological Theory appear to resonate with the experience of psychosis, regardless of suicidality. This may explain why this study was unable to distinguish between <b>those</b> who just <b>think</b> <b>about</b> suicide and <b>those</b> who attempt in a psychosis population. Future research could assess specific features of psychosis and their influence on suicidality...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{surprising}} disconnect between formal rational choice theory and philosophical work on reasons. The one is {{silent on the}} role of reasons in rational choices, the other rarely engages with the formal models of decision problems used by social scientists. To bridge this gap, we propose a new, reason-based theory of rational choice. At its core is an account of preference formation, according to which an agent’s preferences are determined by his or her motivating reasons, together with a ‘weighing relation’ between different combinations of reasons. By explaining how someone’s preferences may vary with changes in his or her motivating reasons, our theory illuminates the relationship between deliberation about reasons and rational choices. Although primarily positive, the theory can also help us <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how <b>those</b> preferences and choices ought to respond to normative reasons...|$|R

40|$|Background: Governmental changes {{sought the}} merging of the {{separate}} residential sections within a regional standalone residential care home in Australia. Nurses working at the facility implemented process changes following action learning sets. A pop quiz was created to help nurses adapt to the changes, asking fun, individualised questions <b>about</b> <b>those</b> they cared for. Aims: To reflect personally and critically on the thoughts, feelings and practices that emerged among the group of nurses after {{the implementation of a}} pop quiz, using Gibbs’ (1988) reflective process. Also, to analyse the effectiveness of the pop quiz in helping create a caring and person-centred culture. Conclusions: The pop quiz proved a significant tool in raising consciousness among this group of nurses about their contribution to the overall care environment and culture of the home, empowering them to move towards a truly person-centred culture rather than moments of person-centredness. Implications for practice: •	Pop quizzes can be a useful tool, challenging practitioners to <b>think</b> critically <b>about</b> <b>those</b> they care for, evoking emotion and raising consciousness about how they are contributing to the care environment and culture •	Pop quizzes are simple to create and could be implemented in any healthcare context...|$|R
