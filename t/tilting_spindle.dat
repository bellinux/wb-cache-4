This paper studied {{functional}} parameters: {{the angle}} of the shaft section (feed flow rotor) and rotor speed which directly influences the yield of screening with three types of sand (NR 1, NC 2 and NT 3). Experiments was determined following an increase of the values of the shaft angle makes sifting efficiency decrease; the greater the passage section of the material, so the feed rate of the rotor, the efficiency decreases; and a higher rotor speed makes sifting flow to increase with increasing speed. Based on experimental data it was obtained a program that is subject to problem solving regression analysis in which the efficiency is represented as a function of two dependent random variables (speed and angle tilt rotor shaft/rotor speed and power flow rotor/angle <b>tilting</b> <b>spindle</b> and feed rate). The test is a prediction of the values output in certain circumstances depending the two variables. With these predictions decisions can be made for the construction/purchase or for screening...|$|E
40|$|Columnar epithelia {{establish}} their luminal domains and their mitotic spindles {{parallel to the}} basal surface and undergo symmetric cell divisions in which the cleavage furrow bisects the apical domain. Hepatocyte lumina interrupt the lateral domain of neighboring cells perpendicular to two basal domains and their cleavage furrow rarely bifurcates the luminal domains. We determine that the serine/threonine kinase Par 1 b defines lumen position {{in concert with the}} position of the astral microtubule anchoring complex LGN-NuMA to yield the distinct epithelial division phenotypes. Par 1 b signaling via the extracellular matrix (ECM) in polarizing cells determined RhoA/Rho-kinase activity at cell-cell contact sites. Columnar MDCK and Par 1 b-depleted hepatocytic HepG 2 cells featured high RhoA activity that correlated with robust LGN-NuMA recruitment to the metaphase cortex, spindle alignment with the substratum, and columnar organization. Reduced RhoA activity at the metaphase cortex in HepG 2 cells and Par 1 b-overexpressing MDCK cells correlated with a single or no LGN-NuMA crescent, <b>tilted</b> <b>spindles,</b> and the development of lateral lumen polarity. ...|$|R

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{that protect}} {{the ends of}} linear chromosomes and are required {{for a wide range}} of cellular processes, as apoptosis, aging, cancer and chromosome stability. Telomere shortens every time a somatic human cell divides. Furthermore human cancers, avoid the progressive loss of telomeric DNA by the telomerase or the telomerase-independent mechanism, termed ALT (Alternative Telomere Lengthening), result into indefinite cell proliferation. However, it has been demonstrated, that several physical or chemical agents are able to modulate telomere length; in particular oxidative stress accelerates telomere shortening. Literature data showed that telomeres are the preferential target for oxidative damage because of ROS able to induce 8 -oxodG from triplet GGG present in human telomeric sequence TTAGGG. Nevertheless, the effects of prolonged oxidative stress on telomere metabolism are still poorly investigated. With the aim to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on telomere length and chromosome segregation and to test mitotic defects, human primary lung fibroblasts (MRC- 5) were daily treated with 10 μM H 2 O 2 and analysed at regular intervals over period of 94 days. The telomere length analysed by Q-FISH (Quantitative-FISH), showed a telomere shortening at 9 - 21 days, and a telomere elongation between 21 - 48 days. Moreover we observed that this trend of “shortening-lengthening” was repeated on time up to 94 days. Based on this repeated trend, we focused our attention to the first 45 days, because at longer time several mechanisms, as senescence, not straight related to oxidative stress effects, could interfere with the results. At this interval of time, we saw a significant telomere shortening after 5 days and a telomere elongation at 15 days of treatment. Based on these results, we confirm that prolonged oxidative stress is responsible of telomere shortening even at low daily doses. Considering that telomere shortening could have an effect on cell viability, first of all, we analysed other endpoints: a) Possible cell cycle perturbation by Cytofluorimetric analysis. We noticed any differences between treated and own control samples. b) The entity of DNA damage induced by prolonged treatment with H 2 O 2 by “Alkaline Comet Assay”. Moreover we used Trypan Blue Assay to evaluate cell viability and this analysis has relieved in all cases that cell death was less than 30 %, value above which the mortality is considered significant. c) To understand if the DNA damage and telomere shortening observed could induce premature senescence, we assessed the number of β- galattosidase positive cells, typically expresses in senescence cells. As expected, we observed a light trend of senescence on time in treated and control samples, with a difference between the two only at 10 - 15 and 20 - 27 days. This led us to conclude that oxidative stress did not induce significant premature senescence in treated cells. Considering that telomere shortening did not alter cell viability, we studied the mechanism responsible of telomere elongation observed at 15 days. To evaluate this mechanism the analysis of telomerase activity was performed by RTQ-TRAP assay that showed no telomerase activation for all fixation times. On the other hand, to verify ALT activation, we assessed two ALT markers: telomeric-sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) by CO-FISH analysis and colocalization of telomeres-PML proteins by FISH and immunostainig. We showed a higher frequency of both these ALT markers at 15 days of treatment, corresponding to the time of telomere elongation observed. This led us to hypothesize Human Primary Fibroblast could activate ALT mechanism, known in literature be present in a little percentage of tumor cells. However we cannot exclude the presence of a cellular selection system that promotes cells with longer telomeres due their major viability. In literature is known that telomere shortening could alter chromosomes segregation by inducing chromosome bridges (end-to-end fusion). To analyse the relation between telomere length and chromosome segregation defects, like chromosome bridges, during my period at the Virginia Tech University we performed Time lapse on live cells and immunostainig (that detect Kinetochore and mitotic spindle) in mitotic cells in the range of 1 - 48 days. Data obtained were pulled and showed an increase of chromosome bridges in treated cells at 5, 27, 41 and 48 days of treatment. The induction of chromosome bridges at 5 days indicated a relation between telomere shortening and chromosome segregation defects. Moreover the reduction of chromosome bridges, observed at 15 days, was related to telomere lengthening saw at the same day. Based on these results, we could observe that telomere shortening induced by oxidative stress at 5 days of treatment could triggers the increase of chromosome bridges induction. Subsequently, we observed a chromosome bridges decrease corresponding to the time of telomere elongation and based on previous results obtained, we hypothesized that ALT mechanism restores telomere length inducing a reduction of chromosome segregation defects related to telomere shortening. In fact, according to literature data, the loss of chromosome ends could result in “sticky” chromosomes that will give rise to dicentric/ring chromosomes: when these dicentric/ring chromosomes will try to separate in anaphase, they will create a chromosome bridge that breaks before or in transition to telophase. Then, the breakage of bridge will create new sticky chromosome ends that could fuse with other sticky ends or that could determine the sister chromatid fusion at the following cell cycle, creating the so called “breakage/fusion/bridge cycle” (BFB). This BFB cycle will continue until the affected chromosome will acquire a new telomere, as in our case when ALT mechanism restores the telomere length. To further assess the effects of telomere length changes on chromosome instability, we evaluated abnormal nuclear structures at 1 - 20 days. We estimated the quantity of NBPs (nucleoplasmic bridge) and NBuds (nuclear Buds), markers of chromosome segregation defects, measuring a significant increase of these biomarkers at 5 days of treatment and confirming previous result obtained for chromosome bridges. These data have been supported by anaphase-lagging chromosomes, marker of chromosome loss. In both fixed- and live-cells. We observed an increase in anaphase lagging chromosomes frequencies over the control at 5, 20, 27 and 41 days of treatment. Additionally, kinetochore positive micronuclei (MN) were analysed by immunostainig. Kinetochore positive MN represents a marker of chromosome loss and aneuploidy (Fenech, M. and Morley, A. A. 1985). Our analysis resulted in a significant increase of kinetochore positive MN in almost all-fixing time. With the aim to evaluate if also other mitotic defects, in addition to chromosome segregation defects, were induced by prolonged oxidative stress, cells with <b>tilted</b> mitotic <b>spindles,</b> defined as the positioning of the spindle long axis at an angle instead of parallel to the substrate, were observed. We observed frequencies of <b>tilted</b> <b>spindles</b> above the control frequencies during the first 10 days, at 27, and 48 days of treatment. These results indicated that prolonged oxidative stress affected spindle structure and/or function. Thus, in addition to the telomeric damage, which causes chromosome rearrangements and can result in chromosome bridges in mitosis, prolonged oxidative stress could also induce telomere-independent mitotic defects, such as MN, lagging chromosomes, which can result in aneuploidy, and cells with <b>tilted</b> <b>spindle.</b> Taken together, these data indicated that prolonged oxidative stress could cause the two most common karyotype defects observed in cancer cells: chromosome rearrangements and aneuploidy...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{critical}} elements in the Four Laser Guide Star Facility (4 LGSF) for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) is the Optical Tube Assembly (OTA), consisting of a stable 20 x laser beam expander and an active tip/tilt mirror, the Field Selector Mechanism (FSM). This paper describes the design and performance testing of the FSM. The driving requirement for the FSM is its large stroke of ± 6. 1 mrad, in combination with less than 1. 5 µrad RMS absolute accuracy. The FSM design consists of a Zerodur mirror, bonded to a membrane spring and strut combination to allow only tip and <b>tilt.</b> Two <b>spindle</b> drives actuate the mirror, using a stiffness based transmission to increase resolution. Absolute accuracy is achieved with two differential inductive sensor pairs. A prototype of the FSM is realized to optimize the control configuration and measure its performance. Friction in the spindle drive is overcome by creating a local velocity control loop between the spindle drives and the shaft encoders. Accuracy is achieved by using a cascaded low bandwidth control loop with feedback from the inductive sensors. The pointing jitter and settling time of the FSM are measured with an autocollimator. The system performance meets the strict requirements, and {{is ready to be}} implemented in the first OTA. © 2011 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|Apical neural {{progenitors}} (aNPs) drive neurogenesis {{by means}} of a program consisting of self-proliferative and neurogenic divisions. The balance between these two manners of division sustains the pool of apical progenitors into late neurogenesis, thereby ensuring their availability to populate the brain with terminal cell types. Using knockout and in utero electroporation mouse models, we report a key role for the microtubule-associated protein 600 (p 600) in the regulation of spindle orientation in aNPs, a cellular event that has been associated with cell fate and neurogenesis. We find that p 600 interacts directly with the neurogenic protein Ndel 1 and that aNPs knockout for p 600, depleted of p 600 by shRNA or expressing a Ndel 1 -binding p 600 fragment all display randomized spindle orientation. Depletion of p 600 by shRNA or expression of the Ndel 1 -binding p 600 fragment also results in a decreased number of Pax 6 -positive aNPs and an increased number of Tbr 2 -positive basal progenitors destined to become neurons. These Pax 6 -positive aNPs display a <b>tilted</b> mitotic <b>spindle.</b> In mice wherein p 600 is ablated in progenitors, the production of neurons is significantly impaired and this defect is associated with microcephaly. We propose a working model in which p 600 controls spindle orientation in aNPs and discuss its implication for neurogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Rotating {{stages in}} semiconductor, display {{industry}} {{and many other}} fields require challenging accuracy to perform their functions properly. Especially, Axis of rotation error on rotary system is significant; such as the spindle error motion of the aligner, wire bonder and inspector machine which result in the poor state of manufactured goods. To evaluate and improve the performance of such precision rotary stage, unessential movements on the other 5 degrees of freedom of the rotary stage must be measured and analyzed.

40|$|Parallel {{kinematics}} structures currently find increasing industrial applications, {{particularly in}} packaging and assembly. With very few exceptions, machine-tools with parallel kinematics {{are limited to}} mechanisms with three or six degrees of freedom. Moreover, the <b>spindle</b> <b>tilt</b> is limited to very small angles. The advantages of parallel kinematics structures are high precision, lower fabrication cost, good dynamics and high stiffness. This dissertation proposes a systematic configuration design method {{for the development of}} new parallel kinematics structures. The parallel structures obtained with this method combine large <b>spindle</b> <b>tilt</b> angles with the advantages of parallel kinematics structures. First, components and characteristic elements of parallel structures are defined and the description of a proposed systematic method for configuration design, the "Design Cube Method", follows. The method enables the design of a family of parallel structures with a specified number and arrangement of mobilities. Methods such as "Gruebler's Formula" and the "Method of Intersecting Trajectories" serve to quickly verify the desired number of degrees of freedom of the structure and the optimal arrangement of the kinematic chains. Several mechanisms are described, that once integrated in a parallel structure, significantly increase the range of tilt of the end-effector, while keeping the stiffness as constant and as high as possible. A new parallel kinematics structure for a five-axis machine-tool has been developed using the new design methods described above. The performance specifications are listed, the desired arrangement of the axis is described and the design cube method is used to generate a new family of parallel kinematics structures. The various structures are evaluated in terms of how suited they are for machine-tool applications, and of the ease of integration of a mechanism to improve the tilt of the end-effector. A laboratory mock-up, demonstrating the various principles, and an industrial prototype of the new machine, the Hita-PDR, have been developed and fabricated. The bar lengths of the structure were selected so as to avoid singularities of the structure in the desired workspace. The specified high stiffness of the industrial prototype required {{the development of a new}} type of joint, the simple and double spherical joints with line contact. The high performances of the industrial prototype confirm the machine concept and the relevant choice of the parallel kinematics structure.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{accuracies}} of {{air bearing}} spindles in the sub-micrometre to nanometre range {{is required for}} the design, commissioning and operation of ultra-precise machine tools, measurement systems and other machines employing high precision rotational motion. In order to verify the dynamic performance of a spindle, measurement is required of its error motions in the unwanted five degrees of freedom (one axial, two tilts and two radial motions). Presentation of these error motions (eg in the form of polar charts) can then be used to provide critical spindle metrology data including total, asynchronous and average error motion rosette profiles and their average and peak values. This thesis describes a metrology system based on optical interferometry for measuring such unwanted error motions in three degrees of freedom involving motion along the spindle axis (axial rectilinear displacement and tilts about orthogonal axes), incurred with rotation of a precision air spindle over its specified speed-range. The system is not sensitive to orthoaxial translations which may be measured using alternative methods. Possible alternative techniques for measuring any of the degrees of freedom include an array of proximity sensors, (one for each translational degree of freedom and a further one for each of the other rotational degrees of freedom), to measure the run-out of an artefact. Proximity sensors based upon capacitive or optical fibre back-scatter techniques each offer the required single degree-of-freedom non-contacting capability and bandwidth. In the current work, a Fizeau interferometer is used to monitor the motion of the spindle of a vertical axis ultra-precision facing machine using a test-artefact. This is a mirror with less than one fringe departure from planarity from which interferogram. fringe-patterns are captured, digitised and analysed synchronously as the spindle rotates. The issue of the prediction of the dynamic form and motions of the observed interferograrn arises and the earlier theory is extended to optimise the set-up, including provision of automatic servo- alignment of the optical axis with the axis of the spindle. Measurement interferograrn data is sampled at selected angular incremental positions of spindle-rotation and image processing techniques used to filter the fringe pattern, enabling measurement of <b>spindle</b> <b>tilt</b> and axial displacement. Issues of sampling with respect to the anticipated spatial angular frequency of the spindle run-out are considered with respect to the speed/frequency capability of data-acquisition and processing arrangements. Essentially, with a spindle rotating at typical machining speeds of 300 - 3000 rev/min, for consistent error motions, the resolution of an error plot is principally a function of observational time. It is foreseen that the system will be applicable in research and production-support in ultra-precision machining production processes and in rotational metrology...|$|R
40|$|Five axis CNC {{machining}} {{centers are}} widely used in the industries for producing the complex parts. Due to two more axes {{as compared to the}} three axes machining, it provides the efficient and flexible way of the machining. Besides this flexibility, accidental collision possibilities between the cutting system and the other moving parts of the machine tools are also increased. These collisions could be avoided by changing the orientations of the tool during the tool path planning or by adjusting the cutter length and the tool holder size after the tool path generation in the part coordinate system. Collision detection and removal by the optimum cutter length depends on the configuration of five axis machine tools. No. of possible candidates for the collision may vary with the configuration of the machine tools. Since the fully utilization of the existing machining facilities in the industry is also in high demand, therefore, after selecting the one of the critical parameter of the cutter length, the maximum utilization of the work space of the 5 -axis machine tools is another critical task. This dissertation comprises of two main works. 	In the first research work, a comprehensive approach for the determination of the optimum cutter length for the specific configuration of five axis machine tool is developed. The complete cutting system (the tool, the tool holder and the spindle), the work in process model and the fixture are the three possible candidates for the collision. The work in process model and the fixture are represented as the point cloud data and the tool holder and the spindle are represented as a regular shape of the truncated cone and the cylinder respectively. Collision checking is conducted in two steps. In the first step the KD-tree data structure is employed on the point cloud data and a method is developed which confines the searching of the point cloud data in the local region and in the second step a new mathematical model for the collision detection between the points in the local region and the cutting system is established. This model also has the capability of removal collision with the optimum cutter length. 	In the second research work, kinematics of the table rotating and <b>spindle</b> <b>tilting</b> 5 -axis machine is developed and setup parameters for mounting the part on the table are defined. A precise method for the determination of the setup parameters, which gives the opportunity of fully utilization of the work space of the machine tool, is developed. Many machining simulation software such as vericut can simulate the G-codes for the given setup parameters of the part and can verify the over travel limits of the machine tool as well as accidental collision between the moving parts of the machine. In this research, the developed method for the determination of the setup parameters gives the guarantee of complete machining of the part without over travel limits of the machine translational axes. This research is based on the predetermined machining strategies, which means, tool path is already given in the part coordinate system. ...|$|R
