5|$|The Uruguay Round of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} member states of the World Trade Organization are the parties to <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> after ratifying the Uruguay Round Agreements, and the European Communities.

2500|$|After the Uruguay round, <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> {{became the}} basis for the {{establishment}} of the World Trade Organization. [...] Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS. [...] For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws. [...] States like Russia and China [...] that were very unlikely to join the Berne Convention have found the prospect of WTO membership a powerful enticement.|$|E

50|$|For {{almost half}} a century (until 1994), <b>the</b> <b>GATT’s</b> basic legal {{principles}} remained much as they were in 1948, and several other meetings were held on further decreasing tariffs, among other relevant issues.

2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs.

Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two.

2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{international}} organization for trade, countries turned, from the early 1950s, to the only existing multilateral international institution for trade, the [...] "GATT 1947", to handle problems concerning their trade relations. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> would over the years [...] "transform itself" [...] into a de facto international organization. It was contemplated that <b>the</b> <b>GATT</b> would be applied for several years until the ITO came into force.

40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and <b>the</b> EU under <b>GATT</b> and <b>the</b> WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international dispute settlement procedures can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under <b>GATT)</b> and <b>the</b> Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), <b>the</b> Steel case (<b>GATT)</b> and <b>the</b> Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under <b>GATT</b> and <b>the</b> WTO respectively, and <b>the</b> Citrus case (<b>GATT)</b> and <b>the</b> Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the judicial WTO dispute settlement procedures than with <b>the</b> diplomatic <b>GATT</b> procedures. We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of dispute settlement procedures can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international dispute settlement procedures does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized dispute settlement procedures are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R
