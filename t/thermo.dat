25|$|The Spectronic 20 was {{replaced}} by the Spectronic 200 in the <b>Thermo</b> Scientific spectrophotometer product line in 2011. The Spectronic 200 utilizes an array detector and digital control of the measured wavelength, while retaining the characteristic λ knob of the Spec 20 for setting the wavelength. In addition to replicating the user modes of the Spec 20D+ (which it can emulate on a color LCD screen) the Spec 200 accommodates both test-tubes and square cuvettes without needing to install an adapter. Software modes described in the Spectronic 200's specifications include scanning, four wavelength simultaneous measurement, and quantitative analysis with up to four standards, in contrast to the SPEC 20D+ which offered only single point calibration.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{individual}} compounds {{was made possible}} in the late 1990s and early 2000s with advancements in mass spectrometry. The <b>Thermo</b> Delta+XL transformed measurements as the first instrument capable of compound specific isotope analysis. It was then possible to look at smaller samples with more precision. Hydrogen isotope applications quickly emerged in petroleum geochemistry by measuring oil, paleoclimatology by observing lipid biomarkers, and ecology by constructing trophic dynamics. Modern advances are currently underway in the clumped isotope composition of methane after development of the carbonate thermometer. Precise measurements are also enabling focus on microbial biosynthetic pathways involving hydrogen. Ecologists studying trophic levels are especially interested in compound specific measurements for construction of past diets and tracing predator-prey relationships. Highly advanced machines are now promising position specific hydrogen isotope analysis of biomolecules and natural gases.|$|E

25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For <b>thermo</b> economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in analytical instruments enable direct measurement of natural abundance D/H ratios in organic molecules.

Two commercial examples are the Nu Panorama and the <b>Thermo</b> Scientific 253 Ultra. These instruments generally have good sensitivity and precision. Using only tens of nanomoles of methane, the Ultra can achieve a stable high precision of around 0.1‰ error in δD. One of the first examples {{of this type of}} measurement has been the clumped isotopes of methane.(See section of [...] "natural gas" [...] in Fossil fuels) Another strength of this kind of instruments is the capability of doing site-specific isotopic ratio measurements.
