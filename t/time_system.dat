5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France.

40|$|What are {{real-time}} systems? Instead {{of trying}} to define them, {{we can think of}} real <b>time</b> <b>systems</b> as those that react to external stimuli in a timely and reliable fashion. Real <b>time</b> <b>systems</b> are often used to solve real world problems. Some examples of real <b>time</b> <b>systems</b> include air traffic control, automatic pilots, unmanned robots etc. Current research in real <b>time</b> <b>systems</b> lags far behind that in other areas.

25|$|The general {{classification}} {{winner was}} not always determined by a <b>time</b> <b>system.</b> In the inaugural Giro d'Italia the organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. In addition to that, the organizers chose the point system since it would be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking the riders during each stage. The race leader was calculated by adding up each rider's placings in each stage and the rider with the lowest total was the leader; if a rider placed second {{in the first stage}} and third in the second stage, he would have five points total. The system was modified a year later to give the riders who placed 51st or higher in a stage 51 points and keep the point distribution system the same for the riders who placed 1st through 50th in a stage. The calculation remained unmodified until 1912 where the organizers chose to have the race be centered around teams, while still keeping the point system. The next year race organizers chose to revert to the system used in 1911. In 1914, the organizers shifted to the system used nowadays, where riders would have their finishing times for each stage totaled together to determine the overall leader.|$|E

40|$|Modeling time related aspects is {{important}} in many applications of verification methods. For precise results, {{it is necessary to}} interpret time as a dense domain, e. g. using timed automata as a formalism, even though the system's resulting infinite state space is challenging for verification methods.

More specialized Poké Balls were introduced, which make Pokémon catching easier in certain situations.

The Next Generation preview, while acknowledging that several flaws in the Secret of Mana combat system had been corrected and praising the boss battles, felt that the computer-controlled characters showed no sense of tactics, resulting in a free-for-all. A review by JeuxVideo.com also noted several improvements in the combat system over the prior game, but felt that battles could turn into a chaotic mass of attacks and numbers. Parsons of RPGamer also called out the Ring system as being flawed, as he found it frustrating that the menu could not be brought up while a character was performing an action, making boss battles hectic and difficult.

To automate compositional verification of <b>timed</b> <b>systems,</b> we propose a compositional verification framework using a learning algorithm for automatic construction of timed assumptions for AGR.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of real-time systems with recursion, through the development of good theoretical techniques which are implementable. Time is modeled using clock variables, and recursion using stacks. Our technique consists of modeling the behaviours of the <b>timed</b> <b>system</b> as graphs, and interpreting these graphs on tree terms by showing a bound on their tree-width. We then build a tree automaton that accepts exactly those tree terms that describe realizable runs of the <b>timed</b> <b>system.</b> The emptiness of the <b>timed</b> <b>system</b> thus boils down to emptiness of a finite tree automaton that accepts these tree terms. This approach helps us in obtaining an optimal complexity, not just in theory (as done in earlier work e. g. [concur 16]), but also in going towards an efficient implementation of our technique. To do this, we make several improvements in the theory and exploit these to build a first prototype tool that can analyze <b>timed</b> <b>systems</b> with recursion...|$|R
