40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the value of pneumatic otoscopy in diagnosing otitis media with effusion in primary care. Pneumatic otoscopy was carried out for 111 children aged one to 16 years and the results obtained compared with those obtained from tympanometry. The children were those who had attended for a regular ear, nose and <b>throat</b> <b>check</b> up in the health centre of a school for the deaf during the period November 1989 to January 1990. Pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry with the GSI 28 instrument (Grason-Stadler) were carried out by a trained ear, nose and throat nurse. All relevant features determined using otoscopy [...] the colour, position and mobility of the tympanum [...] and an overall assessment were recorded. The results of tympanometry were evaluated independently of the otoscopic findings. In the population examined the predictive values of positive and negative results of pneumatic otoscopy for diagnosing effusion were high; the sensitivity was low. Serious retraction of the eardrum and absence of mobility under positive pressure were the most predictive features but the colour of the tympanum did not show any relation to effusion. In the youngest age group (one to five years) 56 % of the children had abnormal otoscopic findings in either one or both ears (odds ratio for this group versus remaining children 3. 75; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 75 to 15. 2). The odds ratios of past and present history of upper respiratory tract infection with respect to abnormal results from otoscopy were 2. 41 (95 % CI 1. 05 to 5. 53) and 2. 95 (95 % CI 1. 17 to 7. 45), respectively. Pneumatic otoscopy carried out by an experienced health care worker is of high diagnostic value when compared with the results of tympanometry. Pneumatic otoscopy can improve the diagnostic capabilities of general practitioners and other primary care workers with regard to otitis media with effusion...|$|E
60|$|A fine-looking young man, who was {{the leader}} in a couple secured by a slave-stick, seemed to regard this woman {{with a degree of}} {{interest}} that argued near relationship. He started forward half involuntarily when the Portuguese half-caste kicked her. He had forgotten for an instant his fellow in rear, as well as the bar of the goree across his <b>throat,</b> which <b>checked</b> him violently; at the same time one of the drivers, who had observed the movement, laid a supple wand across his bare back so sharply as to draw forth a terrific yell of agony.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{and without}} a note of warning, the whole pack turned and rushed back, yelling fiercely, towards the man and woman. The latter clung to the left arm of the former, who raised his stick, and brought it down with such good-will on the skull of the {{foremost}} dog that it reeled back with an angry howl. It was not cowed, however, for it came on again, but the man, instead of striking it, thrust {{the end of his}} stick down its <b>throat</b> and <b>checked</b> it a second time. Still unsubdued, the fierce animal flew at him once more, and would certainly have overcome him if Miles had not run to the rescue {{at the first sign of}} attack. Coming up quickly, he brought his cane down on the dog's head with all his might, having quite forgotten the sword in the excitement of the moment! The blow did nothing to the dog, but it shattered the cane, leaving the sword exposed! This was fortunate. A quick thrust sent the dog flying away with yells of pain and fear, followed by all his companions, who seemed to take their cue entirely from their leader.|$|R
40|$|Determine if {{victim is}} conscious. Tap her/him on {{shoulder}} and yell: “ARE YOU OKAY? ” If there’s no response, start aid at once. The {{first step is}} to open up her/his airway. Put one hand under their neck and gently lift up, while with the other hand you gently push down on their forehead. This “head tilt ” will move tongue away {{from the back of the}} <b>throat.</b> Now <b>check</b> for air. Place your ear and cheek close to the mouth and nose. Listen and feel for return of air. At the same time, look for the chest to rise and fall. Check for about 5 seconds. If there’s still no breathing, start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mouth-to-mouth Resuscitation Maintaining a head-tilt, pinch the nose shut with the hand you had on the forehead; this will prevent leakage. Now open your mouth wide, take a big breath, seal your mouth around her/his mouth, and blow 4 full breaths as fast as you can. You should take only enough time between breaths to lift your head slightly for better inhaling. If this still doesn’t start an air exchange, re-position the head and try again. After 4 more quic...|$|R
60|$|Whilst {{he spoke}} thus, slowly, {{as though to}} gain time, he was looking about him, and as the last word left his lips, knowing that the door was locked, he dashed for the window, hoping, I suppose, to leap through the casement, or if that failed, to shout for help. But Kari, who had set the candles he bore on a side table, that where the writing lay, read his mind. With a {{movement}} more swift {{than that of a}} polecat leaping on its prey, the swiftest indeed that ever I saw, he sprang between him and the casement, so that Deleroy scarce escaped pinning himself upon the steel that he held in his long, outstretched arm. Indeed, I think it pricked his <b>throat,</b> for he <b>checked</b> himself with an oath and drew his sword, a double-edged weapon with a sharp point, as long as mine perhaps, but not so heavy.|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{probability}} of recurrence of {{acute otitis media}} during the preschool years was investigated. SETTING [...] All children born in a semirural Swedish municipality were followed up from birth to their 7 th birthday. DESIGN [...] Information about visits to physicians for acute otitis media was collected retrospectively at all primary health care centres and at paediatric and ear, nose, and <b>throat</b> departments. <b>Check</b> up visits after acute otitis media were excluded. Life table methods were used for analyses. PARTICIPANTS [...] All 1306 children born in the study municipality between 1977 and 1981 were included. Children who moved from the study area during the follow up years (24 %) {{were included in the}} analyses from the date of birth to the date they left the area. MAIN RESULTS [...] At age 3 years, 38 %, 10 %, and 4 % of the children had made at least one, three, and five visits respectively to a physician because of acute otitis media. By their 7 th birthday, 61 %, 24 %, 12 %, and 2 % of the children had made at least one, three, five, and 10 visits respectively to a physician because of this disorder. CONCLUSIONS [...] A strong association was found between the number of visits made for acute otitis media {{during the first year of}} life and the {{probability of}} visiting a physician because of this disorder over the next 12 months...|$|R
6000|$|Emily's {{commanding}} spirit {{seized on}} the reins of government, and employed each of her schoolfellows in the occupation which she was fittest to undertake. [...] "Miss de Sor, {{let me look at}} your hand. Ah! I thought so. You have got the thickest wrist among us; you shall draw the corks. If you let the lemonade pop, not a drop of it goes down your throat. Effie, Annis, Priscilla, you are three notoriously lazy girls; it's doing you a true kindness to set you to work. Effie, clear the toilet-table for supper; away with the combs, the brushes, and the looking-glass. Annis, tear the leaves out of your book of exercises, and set them out for plates. No! I'll unpack; nobody touches the baskets but me. Priscilla, you have the prettiest ears in the room. You shall act as sentinel, my dear, and listen at the door. Cecilia, when you have done devouring those tarts with your eyes, take that pair of scissors (Miss de Sor, allow me to apologize for the mean manner in which this school is carried on; the knives and forks are counted and locked up every night)--I say take that pair of scissors, Cecilia, and carve the cake, and don't keep the largest bit for yourself. Are we all ready? Very well. Now take example by me. Talk as much as you like, so long as you don't talk too loud. There is one other thing before we begin. The men always propose toasts on these occasions; let's be like the men. Can any of you make a speech? Ah, it falls on me as usual. I propose the first toast. Down with all schools and teachers--especially the new teacher, who came this half year. Oh, mercy, how it stings!" [...] The fixed gas in the lemonade took the orator, at that moment, by the <b>throat,</b> and effectually <b>checked</b> the flow of her eloquence. It made no difference to the girls. Excepting the ease of feeble stomachs, who cares for eloquence {{in the presence of a}} supper-table? There were no feeble stomachs in that bedroom. With what inexhaustible energy Miss Ladd's young ladies ate and drank! How merrily they enjoyed the delightful privilege of talking nonsense! And--alas! alas!--how vainly they tried, in after life, to renew the once unalloyed enjoyment of tarts and lemonade! ...|$|R
