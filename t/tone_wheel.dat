AJF's had a conventional ebony bridge with a composite tailpiece and pickguard/finger rest. EMG, Inc. designed a passive humbucking pickup for the AJF's. Volume and <b>tone</b> control <b>wheels</b> were cleverly hidden on the lower edge of the pickguard/finger rest.|$|R
50|$|The Chord Organ {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the Hammond Organ Company in 1950. It was invented primarily by John M. Hanert, who was Hammond's primary musical engineer at the time. He had previously developed the Novachord and Solovox, two instruments which used vacuum-tube circuitry rather than <b>tone</b> or phonic <b>wheels</b> to generate the tones as in a Hammond Organ.|$|R

5000|$|He also {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} device, the Goldschmidt <b>tone</b> <b>wheel,</b> used in early radio receivers {{to receive the}} new continuous wave radiotelegraph signals. The first radio transmitter, the spark-gap transmitter, produced a string of damped waves {{that sounded like a}} buzz or tone in a radio receiver, so the pulses of radio waves used to transmit Morse code were audible as [...] "beeps" [...] in the receiver. However, the new transmitters like the Goldschmidt alternator generated unmodulated continuous waves, which were inaudible in receivers. To make them audible, the <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> receiver used the heterodyne principle to convert the radio frequency to an audio frequency. The <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> was a disk with contacts around the rim, spun by a small electric motor, which interrupted the incoming radio signal at a radio frequency rate. The <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> acted as a crude beat frequency oscillator (BFO), introducing a second radio frequency which combined with the received signal to create a [...] "beat" [...] (heterodyne) frequency at the difference of the two frequencies, in the audio range. For example, if the frequency of the received signal was 60,000 Hz, the <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> could be adjusted to introduce a frequency of 59,000 Hz, creating a 1,000 Hz tone which could be heard in the earphones as a musical [...] "beep" [...] whenever the carrier was present.|$|E
5000|$|... 2002 {{and earlier}} engines {{featured}} a one-piece cast nodular iron crankshaft with counterweights present {{on either side}} of each crank pin. A crankshaft <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> was present between number 1 and number 2 connecting rod pins, and was machined such that a Hall-effect magnetic pickup mounted to the engine block could read the crankshaft's position as it rotates. 2003 and later engines switched to a two-piece crankshaft. The <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> was re-engineered to attach to the crankshaft using three bolts, had a tone pattern substantially different from previous engines, and was moved {{to the rear of the}} crankshaft. For this reason, these engines are generally not interchangeable between the 2002- and 2003+ model years.|$|E
50|$|Improper set-up {{of these}} wheels meant either {{a lack of}} tone, or—usually {{in the case of}} over-eager amateur or {{impatient}} guitarists—too harsh a <b>tone</b> caused by <b>wheels</b> being forced too tightly against the strings. This improper set-up resulted in a quick wearing down of the wheels for which there were no replacements—the wheels were not removable from the arm attachments. This was true of both guitar and bass units.|$|R
50|$|Morestone {{cars in the}} 1950s {{were painted}} a variety of {{non-metallic}} colors, and often were two <b>toned</b> paint. Their <b>wheels</b> were most often plain silver metal. 1960s Budgie cars and trucks were reminiscent of Matchbox, though slightly smaller, with less detail, and simpler with plain paint and no windows (Ragan 2000, p. 27-28). It seems the detail increasingly required to satisfy Matchbox and Hot Wheels' toy-hungry children was something Budgie had problems keeping up with. The Morestone, Modern Product and ESSO series toys were a smaller scale and were the more common; some trucks and motorcycles were a bit larger scale, somewhat like Corgi Toys or Dinkys.|$|R
60|$|Now was its rider's {{opportunity}} to assert his dominion. He plied the willow rod and urged the panting horse on, {{until it was}} white with foam and laboured a little in its gait. Then Dick gently drew the halter, and it broke into a trot; still tighter--and it walked--and in another minute stood still, trembling in every limb. Dick now quietly rubbed its neck, and spoke to it in soothing <b>tones,</b> then he <b>wheeled</b> it gently round and urged it forward. It was quite subdued and docile. In a little time {{they came to the}} river and forded it, after which they went through the belt of woodland at a walk. By the time they reached the open prairie, the mustang was recovered sufficiently to feel its spirit returning, so Dick gave it a gentle touch with the switch, and away they went on their return journey.|$|R
5000|$|A tonewheel or <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{a simple}} {{electromechanical}} apparatus for generating electric musical notes in electromechanical organ instruments such as the Hammond Organ. [...] by Rudolph Goldschmidt and was first used in pre vacuum tube radio receivers as a beat frequency oscillator (BFO) to make continuous wave radiotelegraphy (Morse code) signals audible.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: One of {{the first}} crude {{examples}} of a BFO, the Goldschmidt <b>tone</b> <b>wheel.</b> Before vacuum tube oscillators were invented, the first CW receivers used a wheel with electrical contacts around its rim, spun at a high speed by a motor, to interrupt a current to create a radio frequency signal to beat with the incoming radio signal. This example, at the Tuckerton transatlantic receiving station in New Jersey in 1917, created a 40 kHz signal.|$|E
5000|$|It was predominately {{used for}} liturgical and gospel church organs {{creating}} a Theatre Organ Tremulant effect. It was {{used with the}} Hammond <b>Tone</b> <b>Wheel</b> Organ {{as well as others}} in the 1940s through 1950s as well as today. The final version of the Leslie speaker is the Rotosonic drum wherein a loudspeaker is physically mounted in the spinning rotor with a narrow aperture (opening) to produce a very authentic Theatre Organ tremulant sound. It was also used in psychedelic and rock music of the 1960s and 1970s. It has since made its way into many genres of music, including pop music and jazz. It wasn't until the 1980s that Hammond bought Leslie's product to include with their organs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Lee de Forest {{invented the}} triode {{electronic}} valve. In 1915 he invented the first vacuum tube instrument, the audio piano. Then, until {{the invention of}} the transistor, the vacuum tube was an essential component in electric instruments. In 1935, the Hammond organ was introduced, exploiting previous limited production efforts like the [...] from 1923. It was capable of producing polyphonic sounds by virtue of a spinning shaft with many magnetic 'lobes' which would cycle past an electromagnetic pickup at a rate that would produce each desired <b>tone.</b> [...] "Tone <b>Wheel</b> Organ" [...] is the general name for this technology. The Hammond organ was connected to a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet. In 1929, the electric piano was invented. In 1939, Hammond introduced the Novachord which used about 170 vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors and resistors largely to create an upper octave of notes and then divide them in half using 'flip flop' circuits to create successively lower octaves from each note. But the instrument also has many features like envelopes for filter and amplifiers so that sounds can be contoured at the user's discretion, making it the first production analog synthesizer.|$|R
40|$|Brake squeal is a {{major problem}} for the vehicle {{industry}} due to recla-mations and quality perception of vehicles, as well as the unpredictability of its occurrence. This report investigates the physical reasons behind a multi-tonal brake squeal generated in a motorcycle disc brake. It also covers why previous remedies to eliminate the noise has had an e↵ect, as well as trying to ﬁnd a stable cost-e↵ective solution to the problem. The brake components are studied using numerical simulations as well as experimental analysis, the accuracy of which is investigated by analyzing a simple beam and compar-ing the results to analytical calculations. By performing a FEM-simulation of the di↵erent subsystems, the multi-tonal sound was tracked down to the ABS <b>tone</b> <b>wheel,</b> e. a. the sensory ring that is used for wheel speed mea-surements. By simulating the modes with altered <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> thickness, the modal pattern remains the same albeit reduced in frequency. A character-istic dimension between the tone wheels mounting points where found, as the frequency where these bending modes between the mounting points oc-curred closely correlated with the frequency content of the measured noise. A thinner <b>tone</b> <b>wheel</b> was then manufactured and ﬁeld tested, these test results shows a reduction in frequency for the multi-tonal sound, thus the indications from the simulation is conﬁrmed. Furthermore, an investigation in to brake disc properties is carried out in order to explain the reason why discs with altered geometry lacks the squealing problems of the original disc. This is done by a simulation of the sound propagation eﬃciency of the discs out-of-plane surfaces as well as an experimental study of the insertion loss from the friction surface between the brake disc and the brake pads to the <b>tone</b> <b>wheel.</b> The report ends with suggestions of design changes that can help combat the current issues, as well as problems of the same nature that might arise in future brake design...|$|E
40|$|An {{experienced}} driver will `feather' {{the brakes}} {{so as to}} unwind the suspension compliance and stop the vehicle with only just enough torque in the brakes to hold the vehicle stationary on any gradient, or against the residual torque from an automatic transmission’s torque converter. An optimal stopping problem that minimises the total jerk was formulated and solved. This model was extended by including a linear relationship between the brake pressure and the acceleration of the car where the coefficients are estimated by linear regression. Finally, a Kalman filter estimates {{the state of the}} car using the <b>tone</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|E
