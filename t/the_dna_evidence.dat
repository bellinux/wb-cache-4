5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence,</b> a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E
5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. <b>The</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E

25|$|The {{family had}} been thought to have an Old World origin {{notwithstanding}} the current richness of the family, which is more diverse in the Neotropical New World.

25|$|Samples from bloody shoe prints leading {{away from}} the bodies and from the back gate of the {{condominium}} were tested for DNA matches. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples). Police criminalist Dennis Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse {{at the time of the}} murders. But defense expert Barry Scheck conducted an eight-day cross-examination, questioning most of <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence.</b> Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests.

25|$|Following the {{successful}} conviction of Spencer for the Tucker, Davis and Hellams murders, his DNA was compared with samples collected at other crime scenes, including both open and apparently closed cases. As {{a result of}} these investigations, it was determined that DNA evidence linked him to the 1984 murder of Carol Hamm, a crime for which David Vasquez had been convicted in early 1985. While the standard of <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> was determined to be inconclusive, FBI investigators were sufficiently confident given the factual similarities to the more recent crimes to report their conclusion that Spencer most likely was responsible for the Hamm murder, among others. Vasquez was granted an unconditional pardon for her murder on January 4, 1989, having served five years of a 35-year prison sentence, and became the first American to be exonerated on the basis of contradictory DNA evidence.|$|E

25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. What should have been the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made <b>the</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples.
