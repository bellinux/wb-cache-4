Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) {{he turned his attention}} to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E

25|$|In Darwin's {{theory of}} natural selection, more organisms are {{produced}} than can survive. Some have variations that {{give them a}} competitive advantage, {{and they have the}} best chance of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.|$|E
25|$|From {{the many}} {{subsequent}} periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BCE Mesopotamian art survives {{in a number}} of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not. The Burney Relief is an unusually elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15inches, 50 x 37cm) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BCE, and may also be moulded. Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.|$|E

The manuscript of the chronicle translated by Geoffrey Gaimar cannot be identified accurately, though according to historian Dorothy Whitelock it was [...] "a rather better text than 'E' or 'F'". Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day (the middle of the 12th century); Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century. If it survived to Gaimar's time <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> why [...] was not kept up to date, and why [...] could be given to the monastery at Canterbury.|$|E
500|$|In the 1740s, the Qianlong Emperor {{worried that}} shamanic traditions were {{becoming}} lost, {{especially among the}} Manchu Bannermen who lived in garrisons throughout the empire. To fight this trend, in 1741 he commissioned a [...] "Shamanic Code", based on the rites of the imperial clan, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the use of shamanic instruments {{and the meaning of}} Manchu ritual incantations, many of which had been transmitted by officiants who were not fluent in Manchu, to the point of becoming nonsensical. It was completed in 1747. Its full title in Manchu was [...] Wylie: Ghesei toktopuha Manchusai wetchere metere kauli pitghe, Möllendorff: Hesei toktobuha Manjusai wecere metere kooli bithe, which scholars have translated variously as [...] "Imperially commissioned Manchu rituals for sacrificing to deities and to Heaven," [...] "Rites for the Manchu worship of Heaven and the spirits," [...] and [...] "Imperially commissioned code of rituals and sacrifices of the Manchus." [...] The Code attempted to formalize Manchu shamanistic practices. Historian Pamela Crossley sees it as part of the Qianlong Emperor's attempts to [...] "standardize the cultural and spiritual life of the Manchus," [...] taking the practices of the imperial clan as a model.|$|E

2500|$|Something similar {{may have}} {{happened}} during {{the evolution of the}} Paleoiberian scripts. If writing passed from the Phoenicians through the Tartessians, and the Tartessian language did not have a /g/ or a /d/, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the absence of a distinction between /g/ and /k/, /d/ and /t/ in the southeastern Iberian and later northeast Iberian scripts, despite it being clear that these were distinct sounds in the Iberian language, as is clearly attested in the Greco-Iberian alphabet and later use of the Latin alphabet. In Tartessian script, vowels were always written after the plosives, but they were redundant — or at nearly so — and thus it seems they were dropped when the script passed to the Iberians.|$|E

2500|$|Carpenter {{envisioned the}} film as an inverse of {{traditional}} scenarios in action films with a Caucasian protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In Big Trouble in Little China, Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in one fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the fight begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a commentary track for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) who thinks he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio [...] "didn't get it" [...] and made him write something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the character of Jack Burton. Carpenter {{came up with the}} prologue scene between Egg Shen and the lawyer.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Bakke's later {{career was}} taken up with the study of {{organizational}} theory, looking to find a theoretical approach to analysis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> not only behavior in businesses but also the same in other entities such as churches or schools. [...] In books such as Bonds of Organization: An Appraisal of Corporate Human Relations (1950) he defined all activities of an organization as to falling into one of five categories: perpetuation, workflow, control, identification, and homeostasis. [...] He devised a fusion process theory {{as a way of}} expressing how organizations, and individuals within them, accommodate divergent interests. [...] As such, Bakke was regarding among a group of other eminent organizational theorists active in the 1950s, including Chris Argyris, James G. March, Rensis Likert, Jacob Marschak, Anatol Rapoport, and William Foote Whyte.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} in daily civil operations in Australia since November 1946 so the investigators assumed {{there must have been}} numerous flights with the centre of gravity significantly more than 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. [...] It was necessary for the investigators to find something unique about the fatal flight of VH-BAG <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> its sudden climb immediately after take-off and the pilot's inability to regain control and prevent the aircraft crashing. [...] The aircraft's tailplane {{was one of the few}} parts of the aircraft not destroyed by fire. [...] The position of the elevator trim tab spool appeared to be in the normal position for landing rather than a typical position for take-off. The investigators concluded that on the final takeoff it was likely that the elevator trim tab was still set for landing. [...] This, coupled with the aircraft being tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable after undercarriage retraction, caused the aircraft to pitch nose-up so strongly that the pilot was unable to retain control or prevent the aircraft stalling.|$|E

2500|$|This was a {{reactive}} measure taken {{only six}} days after Prime Minister of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev and President of Cuba Fidel Castro denounced that Puerto Rico remained a territory before the General Assembly of the UN. Fernós was excluded {{of the process and}} shortly afterwards, Muñoz made it clear that no further revision of the status of Puerto Rico were planned in the near future. Despite this, the Resident Commissioner did present H.J.R. 124, requesting the elimination of the loan margin since it was something previously included in the Fernós-Murray Project. The development of the status now fell on an executive order <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the Kennedy administration's position on the Commonwealth equivalent to a [...] "memorandum of understanding" [...] and which would move Puerto Rico's case away from the DOI. The status strategy would now focus on two proposals, the Executive Order & Memorandum and the informal and secretive [...] Presidential Commission. In a letter sent to Chester Bowles, Muñoz admitted that the idea behind this strategy was not to actually change the status of Puerto Rico, but instead to disable the argument that Puerto Rico remained a colony, one that was [...] "a weapon freely used by Communists, Fidelistas and enemies of the United States".|$|E
