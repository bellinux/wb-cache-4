25|$|Achieving full {{acceleration}} or hill climbing, {{while avoiding}} engine speeds {{higher than a}} certain limit (e.g. 3000 or 4000 RPM), is difficult since it requires avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch. Avoiding triggering the kick-down-switch requires a good feel of the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal,</b> but use of full throttle can still be achieved with a little sensitivity as the kick-down button is only activated beyond the normal full opening of the accelerator pedal.|$|E
500|$|While {{operating}} modes are switched automatically the Volt {{allows the}} driver to choose from three drive modes: normal, sport and mountain. The mountain mode, {{which is expected to}} be required only under unusual power demand conditions, increases minimum battery state of charge (SOC) to around 45%, thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades. The driver will hear more engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode. The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher, and the response to the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> is quicker. The Ampera has an additional option, the [...] "City Mode" [...] or [...] "battery hold", allowing {{the driver to}} save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones. The 2013 model year Volt includes a [...] "Hold" [...] option to provide the same choice.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal),</b> the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using the left foot to operate the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right foot dedicated to the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal.</b> It contrasts with the practice of using the left foot to operate the clutch pedal, leaving the right foot to share the duties of controlling both brake and accelerator pedals.|$|E
50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a {{hand lever}} to control the throttle. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a hand lever to set the minimum throttle.

50|$|The {{two-stroke}} Sonett II transmissions had a freewheel {{that could}} be engaged and disengaged while in motion via a pull handle down near the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal.</b> The freewheel was required in the normal (non oil pump engines) SAAB two stroke engines {{but not in the}} Sonett since it had an automatic oiling system fed from a supply tank that obviated the need to add oil to the fuel.|$|E
50|$|Most {{automatic}} transmissions include some means of forcing a downshift (Throttle kickdown) into {{the lowest possible}} gear ratio if the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> is fully depressed. In many older designs, kickdown is accomplished by mechanically actuating a valve inside the transmission.

The results of the validation show that the behaviours of the model closely follow the behaviour of a real vehicle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a robotic driver for the automation of dynamometer based vehicle testing. The aim is to successfully follow industry standard test cycles used for emissions testing and produce repeatable results. Success will be measured by not exceeding the limits set for human drivers for a successful test. The design of this robotic driver is unique; it uses a single linear motion to actuate the brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>pedals</b> controlled by two cascaded PID controllers (vehicle speed and pedal actuator position). A full SIMULINK model has been created and used for simultaion and rapid control prototyping using dSPACE. The system has been developed and tested from simulation through to actual dynamometer testing. Test results show that by time-shifting the drive cycle 2 seconds forward, the robotic driver successfully adhered to the ADR 37 / 01 standard, and produced repeatable results. Further development is needed to improve the performance and overcome current system limitations such as motor saturation and accelerator pedal stick-slip. 1...|$|R

50|$|Usually, the {{throttle}} valve is controlled with a <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> or lever via a direct mechanical linkage. In vehicles with electronic throttle control, the manual throttle control sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of {{the throttle}} valve. This means that the operator does not have direct control over the throttle valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the <b>throttle</b> <b>pedal</b> is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{development}} of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) - mainly based on lidar and cameras - has considerably improved the safety of driving in urban environments. These systems provide warning signals for the driver in the case that any unexpected traffic circumstance is detected. The {{next step is to}} develop systems capable not only of warning the driver but also of taking over control of the car to avoid a potential collision. In the present communication, a system capable of autonomously avoiding collisions in traffic jam situations is presented. First, a perception system was developed for urban situations - in which not only vehicles have to be considered, but also pedestrians and other non-motor-vehicles (NMV). It comprises a differential global positioning system (DGPS) and wireless communication for vehicle detection, and an ultrasound sensor for NMV detection. Then, the vehicles actuators - brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>pedals</b> - were modified to permit autonomous control. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller was implemented capable of analyzing the information provided by the perception system and of sending control commands to the vehicles actuators so as to avoid accidents. The feasibility of the integrated system was tested by mounting it in a commercial vehicle, with the results being encouraging. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Simulating {{the test}} drive {{conditions}} {{have become an}} important area {{for research and development}} in automotive industry. The use of dedicated robots instead of human drivers in order to perform vehicle emission tests is so common; however these robots are very heavy, expensive and still perform bodily.

The simulation has been executed in LabVIEW which easily can be connected to hardware, CompactRIO, in order to drive the vehicle by wire. In this study based on the vehicle model, control and simulation of the vehicle under emission tests circumstances is discussed. A longitudinal model of the vehicle has been presented. The brake and throttle are the inputs and vehicle velocity and the main components of the exhaust gases are the outputs of the vehicle model. To control the vehicle, a fuzzy control which is nonlinear is designed and the performance of the controller is compared with a classical PID controller. Two individual fuzzy controllers have been applied to control the brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>pedals.</b> Therefore the outputs are the instantaneous throttle opening and the brake position in terms of brake torque. The inputs are the difference between the real speed and the desired speed and the rate of change of the error...|$|R
