5|$|Thatcher became closely {{aligned with}} the Cold War {{policies}} of US President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult {{with her on the}} invasion of Grenada. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a <b>takeover</b> <b>offer</b> from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.|$|E

25|$|In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, Sonae's <b>takeover</b> <b>offer</b> for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board {{rejected}} {{an initial}} bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed Belmiro de Azevedo (founder and historical chairman of Sonae holding company) {{and his son}} Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of Sonae.com telecommunications operator) to the investor José Berardo and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro. In April 2007 the European Commission gave an ultimatum to the Portuguese government ordering it {{to give up on}} the 500 golden shares pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This could give the government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its media assets (PT Multimédia), that included TV Cabo and Lusomundo Cinemas. In January 2008, the European Commission began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the Spanish government to give up its golden share in the other telecommunications' major player in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} broadsheet newspaper reporting of <b>takeover</b> <b>offers</b> and market abuse cases on the corporate governance quality of the UK listed companies involved. The study examined 111 <b>takeover</b> <b>offers</b> and 25 market abuse cases from 2001 to 2010. Corporate governance quality is assessed {{from the perspective of}} the board of directors using an original scoring methodology devised herein. The scoring methodology is founded upon principles of best practice set out in UK regulatory guidelines; the statutory responsibilities expected of boards of UK companies; and recommendations expressed in academic commentary and specialist reports on corporate governance. The level of newspaper reporting is measured using the archives of eight prominent UK broadsheet publications. The results of statistical analysis indicate a significant association between changes in corporate governance quality and newspaper reporting on <b>takeover</b> <b>offers</b> but not for market abuse cases. This study sheds insight into the role the broadsheet media plays in corporate governance and contributes to a growing strand of research on the capacity of the media to lower agency costs. Findings imply that the broadsheet newspaper media serves a potentially important function in facilitating the operation of the market for corporate control. Specifically, by reporting on companies’ vulnerability to takeover, the newspaper media can create reputational costs for target directors thereby encouraging governance improvements in target companies. This thesis adds to an extensive body of literature on corporate governance and the market for corporate control in the UK by identifying the newspaper media as a significant intermediary in the context of the London Stock Exchange. Findings suggest a need for enhanced shareholder monitoring of boards of targets of failed takeover offers; greater clarity in guidelines on best practice in corporate governance; and increased acknowledgement of the impact of the media on corporate governance at policy level...|$|R
25|$|From 2015, Hornby plc {{began to}} {{announce}} a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was two fold, with {{the decline in the}} number of (now aged, and hence older) collectable customers, and a lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the digitization and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range. In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016. The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest - and activist/protagonist shareholder - New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. This triggered under stock exchange rules a mandatory <b>takeover</b> <b>offer</b> of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI strike price of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million. As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.|$|E

NASDAQ also purchased 2.69million additional shares, resulting in a total stake of 15%. While the seller of those shares was undisclosed, it occurred simultaneously with a sale by Scottish Widows of 2.69million shares.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that a significant fraction of the returns to merger announcements reflects target revaluation rather than the causal effect of the merger. In a sample of unsuccessful merger bids from 1980 to 2008, targets of cash offers are revalued by + 15 % after deal failure, whereas stock targets revert to their pre-announcement levels. Impor-tantly, this result holds for the subsample where deal failure is exogenous to the target’s stand-alone value. Since cash targets are also not differentially related to future <b>takeover</b> <b>offers,</b> we conclude that cash deals signal positive information about the stand-alone value of the target. We also show that cash bidders revert to their pre-announcement levels, while stock bidders fall below. Our revaluation estimates imply economically larg...|$|R
