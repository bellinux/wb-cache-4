50|$|Owing to <b>the</b> <b>abandonments</b> during <b>the</b> Thirty Years' War {{and shortly}} {{thereafter}} the Plague, {{the town was}} for decades almost uninhabited, and eventually, a fire set by French troops in 1693 destroyed most of the houses.

5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is probably due to <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites.

5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after {{which most of}} the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on {{moveable}} or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E

5|$|After {{both were}} reacquired by the Ward Line, Orizaba and Siboney {{were placed in}} transatlantic service on New York–Cuba–Spain routes in 1920, with Orizaba calling at Corunna, Santander, and Bilbao in Spain. The two ships {{accommodated}} 306first-class, 60second-class, and 64third-class passengers, with each ship making several trips on the route, but a lack of passengers (along with the grounding of Siboney at Vigo in September 1920) led to <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the route.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, {{there is}} no {{incompatibility}} between devotion to Rama and attachment to Shiva. Tulsidas equates the Guru as an incarnation of Shiva, and a considerable part of the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas {{is devoted to the}} narrative of Shiva including <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of Sati, the penance of Parvati, the burning of Kamadeva and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva. In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman. At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika, he bows to Ganesh, Surya, Shiva, Devi, Ganga, Yamuna, Varanasi and Chitrakoot, asking them for devotion towards Rama.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws.

5|$|During the 9th century AD, {{the central}} Maya region {{suffered}} major political collapse, marked by <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of cities, {{the ending of}} dynasties, and a northward shift in activity. No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought. During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity. Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in the wet}} stage, a {{group of}} nine riders broke away, only to be pulled back the peloton, with a second group of {{nineteen}} also failing. An unsuccessful move from Tony Martin was followed by an attack by Vincenzo Nibali over the Col de Grimone {{and the formation of}} an elite five-strong group on descent with Rui Costa, Alejandro Valverde, and Tony Gallopin. This attack reduced the main group of chasers and caused <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of several riders. The advantage of the break was over three minutes as they climbed the Col de Rousset, with Nibali briefly escaping on the subsequent descent.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{was elected}} to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, {{becoming}} the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the revitalization of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, particularly with <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter's presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.|$|E

5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> {{of villages}} from the bubonic plague of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third {{to a half}} of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Winehouse's {{spokesman}} {{reported that}} the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music. The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, her record label, announced <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> of the specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
