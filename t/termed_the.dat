5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation <b>termed</b> <b>the</b> latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is {{not exactly the same}} as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he <b>termed</b> <b>the</b> Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often <b>termed</b> <b>the</b> Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account.

The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E

5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often <b>termed</b> <b>the</b> “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most of {{the common}} {{techniques}} of text mining {{are based on the}} statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency. <b>The</b> statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency captures <b>the</b> importance of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> within <b>the</b> document only. An alternate approach would be to enhance the mining model to include the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics of the text so that <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> that capture <b>the</b> concepts of the document and thereby the similarity between the documents may be found. The contribution of each <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics at the sentence, document and corpus levels is determined using sentence-based concept-analysis, document-based concept-analysis and corpus-based concept-analysis respectively. A concept-based similarity measure is used to determine the similarity between the documents...|$|R

5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England.

5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been <b>termed</b> <b>the</b> dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.|$|E
