Their study used a science text {{as the base}} of a lesson and {{decorative}} images as the seductive details. They found that readers were less able <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> own comprehension of the text when the text was sprinkled with decorative images.|$|E

5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E

5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E
5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E

5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Soviet Navy and Communist Bloc's fishing fleets began {{operating}} around the British Isles in increasing numbers. The British public began taking {{an interest in}} their operations as civilian fisherman began complaining about their presence. Operation Chacewater began, in which Coastal Command began monitoring their movements, in particular other vessels that loitered in areas covering the arrival and departure routes for Royal Navy nuclear submarine forces. Soon after, counter operations such as Operation Adjutant were carried out, which was aimed at searching for Soviet submarines. The main threat from the Soviets in the Atlantic came from the Soviet Northern Fleet and in early 1965 most of the Command's units were concentrated in No. 18 Group RAF, based in Scotland <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> activities. No recorded confrontation took place between Coastal Command and Soviet naval forces during this time, although both the Shackletons from RAF Ballykelly and frigates operating out of Londonderry would 'ping' the Soviet submarines carrying out surveillance off the mouth of Lough Foyle. In at least one instance, a Ballykelly-based Shackleton lost its radome when making a mock attack on the Russian sub.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{human rights}} {{violations}} tend to be common during insurgencies and counterinsurgency efforts. Western powers conducting multiple foreign internal defense (FID) operations are coming under increasing pressure to provide human rights and Geneva Conventions training to host nation personnel, although the results vary. Part of the challenge arrives when host nation personnel gets involved in combat without FID advisers, who are supposed <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> conduct and prevent abuses. The 1980-1992 Salvadoran Civil War, where {{human rights violations}} were documented on both sides, can be cited as an example.|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{states and}} feudal states, both low in infrastructural power, {{depend on the}} despotic rule of an elite class for {{societal}} order.

Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the infrastructural power of developed states rose rapidly. In the modern era, developed states became able <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>their</b> populations; provide employment, health care and welfare; impact all levels of the economy; and more. In this way, they obtained their infrastructural power.|$|E
