5|$|<b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War have been disputed. Lincoln was {{associated}} with two major battle sites, including Stillman's Run, {{in the aftermath of}} combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at the grove to help bury the dead. One of these soldiers was Lincoln, who assisted with the burial. His later statement about the events has been linked to both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|When Kurt Waldheim {{was named}} {{secretary-general}} of the United Nations in 1971, Wiesenthal reported—without checking very thoroughly—that {{there was no evidence}} that he had a Nazi past. This analysis had been supported by the opinions of the American Counterintelligence Corps and Office of Strategic Services when they examined his records right after the war. However, Waldheim's 1985 autobiography did not include his war service following his recuperation from a 1941 injury. When he returned to active duty in 1942, he was posted to Yugoslavia and Greece, and had knowledge of murders of civilians that took place in those locations during his service there. The Austrian news magazine Profil published a story in March 1986—during his campaign for the presidency of Austria—that Waldheim had been a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The New York Times soon reported that Waldheim had failed to reveal all of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> his war service. Wiesenthal, embarrassed, attempted to help Waldheim defend himself. The World Jewish Congress investigated the issue, but the Israeli attorney general concluded that their material was insufficient evidence for a conviction. Waldheim was elected president in July 1986. A panel of historians tasked with investigating the case issued a report eighteen months later. They concluded that, while {{there was no evidence that}} Waldheim had committed atrocities, he must have known they were occurring, yet did nothing. Wiesenthal unsuccessfully demanded that Waldheim resign. The World Jewish Congress successfully lobbied to have Waldheim barred from entering the United States.|$|E

25|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} conflict, the Rhodesian {{government}} resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera and the toxin Sodium Coumadin, an anti-coagulant commonly used as the active ingredient in rat poison. Food stocks in the area were contaminated with anthrax spores. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> this episode became known during the hearings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the late 1990s.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic.

According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop.

500|$|In December 1979, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals {{ruled in}} favor of Professor Anspach, with an opinion that agreed with <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> the game's history and {{differed}} from Parker Brothers' [...] "official" [...] account.

[...] This had the effect of potentially nullifying the Monopoly trademark, and the court returned the case to Judge Williams. Williams heard the case again in 1980, and in 1981 he again held for Parker Brothers. Anspach appealed again, and in August 1982 the appeals court again reversed. The case was then appealed by General Mills/Parker Brothers to the United States Supreme Court, which decided not to hear the case in February 1983, and denied a petition for rehearing in April. This allowed the appeals court's decision to stand and further allowed Anspach to resume publication of his game.|$|E

500|$|On November 17, 2015, the Attorney General filed {{a request}} for a {{temporary}} injunction to force DraftKings and FanDuel to cease serving customers in the state of New York.

The Attorney General also issued a subpoena for information from Yahoo! in regards to its own daily fantasy offerings. FanDuel stated that it would comply with the order and restrict participation by residents of New York, while DraftKings stated that it would continue to serve them, arguing that Schneiderman's decision was based on an [...] "incomplete understanding of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>about</b> how our business operates and a fundamental misinterpretation and misapplication of the law".|$|E
