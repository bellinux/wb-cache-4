Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 {{there were more}} than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 <b>Taipeh</b> Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from Guangdong, between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and Hakka settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern. Taiwan was also plagued by foreign invasions.|$|E

However the soil proved too soft to support so heavy a structure, and the project was halted. Subsequently, governor of Fujian Cen Yu-ying (岑毓英) and Taiwan magistrate Liu Ao (劉璈) undertook successive surveys to determine the proper location of the wall's foundations.
