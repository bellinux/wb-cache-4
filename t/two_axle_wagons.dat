The three intermediate unpowered vehicles in the Windhoff CargoSprinter are <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> <b>wagons,</b> the Talbot intermediate unpowered cars use two axle jacobs articulation between the wagons, and two axle bogies on the end wagons.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{theoretical}} ground for the weeding-out of the <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> <b>wagons</b> with short wheel base, {{we are going to}} prove by numerical calculations how the rail side-thrust caused by vehicle yawing is changed by the size of wheel bases. 　The yawing of two axle vehicles running on the rails with sinuous form deformations was analyzed and we got the following conclusion by applying to this the data of the present vehicles. lf a goods wagon of 10 t. carrying capacity uses a 4 m. wheel base instead of a 3 m. wheel base, the rail side-thrust by yawing will decrease 25 %...|$|E
30|$|As most of {{the current}} Swiss Split {{shipments}} are transported on four-axle wagons (89  %) or on conventional container wagons (4  %) there is only very low demand (7  %) for a new designed <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> <b>wagon.</b> Thus, the New Swiss Split wagon was designed only as a four-axle wagon.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{milk tank}} wagon designs {{were based on}} a 12 ft <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> railway <b>wagon</b> chassis. There was a ladder either side to allow filling via an {{industrial}} rubber hose into a flip-top dome casing, while a steel pipe exited {{at the bottom of the}} tank with a tap either end of the chassis between the buffer beams for extraction. All designs unlike typical goods wagons used vacuum braking, due to their high-speed deployment. The various designs that railway companies used followed a common pattern, but even at this early stage differences appeared making them easy to spot. While GWR designs used flat-strip metal as bracing, LMS and SR designs used rounded steel bracing. SR designs had additional V-shaped support bracing either end, and had additional wooden packing behind each of the buffers. LMS designs had a catwalk around the filling dome.|$|R
40|$|Future {{high speed}} trains {{are the main}} focus of the DLR {{research}} project Next Generation Train (NGT). One central point of the research activities is the development of a mechatronic track guidance for the <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> intermediate <b>wagons</b> with steerable, individually powered, independently rotating wheels. The traction motors hereby fulfil two functions; they concurrently are traction drives and steering actuators. In this paper, the influence of the track properties – line layout and track irregularities – on the performance requirements for the guidance actuator is investigated using multi-body-models in SIMPACK®. In order to compromise on the design conflict between low wheel wear and low steering torques, the control parameters of the mechatronic track guidance are optimized using the DLR in-house software MOPS. Besides of the track irregularities especially the increasing inclination at transition curves defines high actuator requirements due to gyroscopic effects at high speed. After introducing a limiter for the actuating variables into the control system a good performance is achieved...|$|R

50|$|In 1865, {{he opened}} his own {{construction}} and repair workshop for agricultural machinery, which moved in 1869 to a plot at Jagiellońska street 94. It was a small foundry, specialized {{in the manufacture of}} patent <b>axle</b> <b>wagon</b> and woodworking machines. In 1878, he bought from Julius Schmidt a small iron foundry on Nakelerstraße, expanded it and installed there steam engines. In 1878, the firm took the name of C. Blumwe and Son, since his son Wilhelm took over the management in the early 1880s. In 1884, the name changed to C. Blumwe and Son - Iron Foundry Specialized in patent <b>axle</b> <b>wagon</b> and woodworking machines: it is the ground base of today's Machine Tools Factory for Wood.|$|R
40|$|A {{portable}} device for assessing rail bending and torsion {{as well as}} the relative wheel-rail position was designed and tested. The main requirement for this device is that its first eigenfrequency should be well above the first bending eigenfrequency of the rail in order not to dynamically amplify rail bending motions. Thus, a minimum target frequency of 100 Hz is set. Another requirement is to design a device that could be easily mounted on different track sections in order to assess also the influence of vehicle type and speed. Thus, a {{portable device}} based on laser sensors was produced that does not require any operations on the rails (contactless sensors) and allows to place the sensors at a reasonable distance from both the rail and the passing by wheel. Tests were performed on a dedicated test track in Czech Republic both at low speed (20 km/h on a 150 m radius curve) and at medium speed (90 km/h on a 600 m radius curve) with <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> and four <b>axle</b> <b>wagons.</b> Installation was extremely easy and acquired signals were post-elaborated to assess rail vertical and lateral bending as well as torsion...|$|R
