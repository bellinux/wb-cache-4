5|$|The {{entire day}} of a Jain monk is spent in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
5|$|Maria-sama ga Miterus story {{revolves}} around the students of the Lillian Girls' Academy and is character-driven, focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain. When the story begins, Yumi Fukuzawa, a first-year student at Lillian, is praying {{in front of the}} Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi's uniform neckerchief. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day, and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland {{in the late eighteenth}} century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify <b>this</b> <b>seemingly</b> triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others {{about the history of the}} no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E

5|$|According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice {{spent on}} average 60,000 ducats {{per year in}} <b>this</b> <b>seemingly</b> fruitless conflict, but the Venetians {{themselves}} were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, {{while at the same}} time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and Lesbos), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made clear to the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.|$|E
25|$|The final {{issue of}} Simpsons Illustrated was a {{one-shot}} comic edition titled Simpsons Comics and Stories.

25|$|The German {{military}} occupation {{of a large}} part of France made France's hold on its overseas possessions, including Indochina, difficult. The colonial administration was now cut off from outside help and outside supplies. After the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in September 1940, the French were forced to allow Japan to set up military bases. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> subservient behaviour convinced the Phibun regime that France would not seriously resist a confrontation with Thailand.|$|E

Though it may be considered frivolous, cat-related internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> {{was enough}} for the touring side as England crashed to 0/1 and soon 35/3. By the time captain Paul Collingwood was run out, England needed 99 runs to win with all-rounder Ravi Bopara and bowler Stuart Broad {{to fend off the}} {{remaining}} 26 overs. Surprisingly the two put a record eight wicket partnership for England, the hosts taking the series 3–1 with a three-wicket victory and Broad picking up man of the match for his 45 not out and 4/51.|$|E
25|$|After skirmishing near Chapman's Mill in Thoroughfare Gap, Ricketts's Union {{division}} was flanked on August 28 by a Confederate column passing through Hopewell Gap several {{miles to the}} north and by troops securing the high ground at Thoroughfare Gap. Ricketts retired, and Longstreet's wing of the army marched through the gap to join Jackson. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> inconsequential action virtually ensured Pope's defeat during the battles of August 2930 because it allowed the two wings of Lee's army to unite on the Manassas battlefield. Ricketts withdrew via Gainesville to Manassas Junction.|$|E

25|$|Although the 15 {{orders of}} the Seder have been complete, the Haggadah concludes with {{additional}} songs which further recount the miracles that occurred on this night in Ancient Egypt as well as throughout history. Some songs express a prayer that the Beit Hamikdash will soon be rebuilt. The last song to be sung is Chad Gadya ("One Kid Goat"). <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> childish song about different animals and people who attempted to punish others for their crimes and were in turn punished themselves, was interpreted by the Vilna Gaon as an allegory to the retribution God will levy over the enemies of the Jewish people {{at the end of}} days.|$|E
25|$|P. dominula is {{a social}} insect that lives in colonies. They are haplodiploid insects, as are other Polistes species. The haploid males produce {{identical}} haploid sperm, and diploid females produce haploid eggs through meiosis. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to W. D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection. However, in P. dominula, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence of altruism in P. dominula.|$|E
25|$|During the Panmunjeom Truce negotiations, {{the chief}} {{stumbling}} block to {{the arrangement of}} a final armistice {{during the winter of}} 1951–1952 revolved around the exchange of prisoners. At first glance, there appeared to be nothing to argue about, since the Geneva Conventions of 1949, by which both sides had pledged to abide, called for the immediate and complete exchange of all prisoners upon the conclusion of hostilities. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> straightforward principle, however, disturbed many Americans. To begin with, UN prisoner-of-war camps held over 40,000 South Koreans, many of whom had been impressed into Communist service and who had no desire to be sent north upon the conclusion of the war. Moreover, a considerable number of North Korean and Chinese prisoners had also expressed a desire not to return to their homelands. This was particularly true of the Chinese POWs, some of whom were anti-Communists whom the Communists had forcibly inducted during the Chinese Civil War into the PLA unit that was later transferred into Korea.|$|E

25|$|Doug Williams was the lowest-paid {{starting}} {{quarterback in the}} NFL during the 1982 season, and his salary of $120,000 was less than several backups. At {{the end of the}} season, Williams asked for a raise to $600,000 per season—a reasonable sum at that time, given Williams’ past performance and his market value. However, Culverhouse would not offer more than $400,000 despite McKay's protests. Feeling that Culverhouse was unwilling to pay him a salary befitting his status as an NFL starter, Williams bolted to the USFL, where he played two seasons for the Oklahoma Outlaws. Without Williams, the Bucs appeared to be a rudderless team. The Bucs started the next season by losing their first nine games, knocking them out of playoff contention. They finished with a 2-14 record, the first of an NFL-record 12 straight seasons with ten or more losses. Many Bucs fans blamed Williams’ departure for <b>this</b> <b>seemingly</b> endless streak of futility, and the fact that Williams later returned to the NFL and led the Washington Redskins to victory in Super Bowl XXII only deepened the frustration among Bucs fans.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E
25|$|In June 1940 the Fall of France {{made the}} French hold on Indochina tenuous. The {{isolated}} colonial administration {{was cut off}} from outside help and outside supplies. After negotiations with Japan, the French allowed the Japanese to set up military bases in Indochina. <b>This</b> <b>seemingly</b> subservient behavior convinced Major-General Plaek Pibulsonggram, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, that Vichy France would not seriously resist a campaign by the Thai military to recover parts of Cambodia and Laos that {{had been taken from}} Thailand by France in the early 20th century. In October 1940, the military forces of Thailand attacked across the border with Indochina and launched the Franco-Thai War. Although the French won an important naval victory over the Thais, Japan forced the French to accept Japanese mediation of a peace treaty that returned the disputed territory to Thai control. The French were left in place to administer the rump colony of Indochina until 9 March 1945, when the Japanese staged a coup d'état in French Indochina and took control, establishing their own colony, the Empire of Vietnam, as a double puppet state.|$|E

[...] Winship, citing the work of historian Mary Beth Norton, suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament. [...] This was [...] "not histrionics, but pedagogy," [...] according to Winship; it was Hutchinson's attempt to teach the Court, and doing so was consistent with her character.|$|E
