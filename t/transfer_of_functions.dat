In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the <b>Transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Functions</b> Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> through equivalence relations {{has been}} widely studied, owing to its potential to explain phenom-ena such as emotional disorders and certain thera-peutic processes (Dougher, Augustson, Markham, Greenway, & Wulfert, 1994). Two related terms need to be distinguished. Dymond and Rehfeldt (2000) used the term “transfer ” to describe re-sponse patterns indicative <b>of</b> a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> through symmetrical equivalence relations. Thus, {{it is assumed that}} if the vehicle through which new functions emerge is an equivalence relation, the phenomenon is termed <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>function,</b> whereas if the relations between stimuli are of a different nature, the phenomenon is then termed transformation <b>of</b> <b>function</b> (Dymond & Rehfeldt, 2000; Luciano & Gómez, 2001). Specifically, <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> refers to the acquisition by the stimulus <b>of</b> a new <b>function</b> after a variable is applied to a different member of that equivalence class. Thus in a test of functional equivalence we would expect to see a new reinforcing or pun-ishing function for a given stimulus after that function is applied to a unique and different stimulus in the same functional class (Dougher...|$|R

Such {{models have been}} applied {{to a range of}} behavioral tasks and have demonstrated <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> via equivalence relations following appropriate training, with networks accurately simulating the behavior of human subjects. In the current study, a connectionist network was pretrained on a series of equivalence and sequence tasks to simulate the preexperimental experience of an adult subject. It was then exposed to the equivalent of six conditional discriminations, and was tested for the formation of three 3 -member equivalence classes (corresponding to A 1 -A 2 -A 3, B 1 -B 2 -B 3, C 1 -C 2 -C 3). It was subsequently trained to produce a pair of four part sequences (corresponding to B 1 -+B 2 -+Ct 1 -+B 3 and B 3 -+ B 2 -+Ct 2 -+ B 1, where Ct 1 and Ct 2 represented contextual cues) before being tested for <b>transfer,</b> through equivalence, <b>of</b> the sequence responses to the C stimuli. Following appropriate pretraining, the network showed the formation of three equivalence classes and a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> sequence <b>function</b> to the nontrained C stimuli (producing the novel sequences C 1 -+C 2 -.
