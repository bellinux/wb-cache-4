Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada, and citing <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars, the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in 1996.

2500|$|The ADA {{has been}} criticized {{on the grounds that}} it {{decreases}} the employment rate for people with disabilities and raises <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>business</b> for employers, in large part due to the additional legal risks, which employers avoid by quietly avoiding hiring people with disabilities. Some researchers believe that the law has been ineffectual. [...] Between 1991 (after the enactment of the ADA) and 1995, the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 7.8% regardless of age, educational level, or type of disability, with the most affected being young, less-educated and mentally disabled men. Despite the many criticisms, a causal link between the ADA and declining disabled employment over much of the 1990s has not been definitively identified.|$|E
