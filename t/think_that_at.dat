25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to}} be ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 {{the first}} Faroese patient with {{systemic}} primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD) was diagnosed. Later other patients were found, {{but nothing was}} done {{to find out if}} the illness was common or if something should be done about it. Not until 2008 when a young woman died just a few days after being diagnosed with SPCD (in the Faroes, the illness is named CTD), actions were finally taken by the Faroese health authorities. The young woman had not been treated, and this caused a big discussion about how to prevent this from happening again. Shortly after, all Faroese people in the Faroes were invited to take a blood sample for a small cost and get it screened for SPCD. Several persons with the illness were found and got treatment immediately. It is now known that several Faroese people have died a sudden death at a young age because of this illness. Around one third of the Faroese population has been screened for SPCD (with a blood sample), and scientists <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least one of every 1000 inhabitants of the Faroes have the illness. There have also been found elderly people who have survived the illness without treatment. The treatment is to give the patients carnitine supplement. The German physician and scientist Ulrike Steurwald, who has done research in the Faroe Islands for several years, has argued that the Faroese diet of red meat, like sheep meat and whale meat which contain high amounts of carnitine, may have protected many Faroese people from a sudden death at a young age from SPCD. The whale meat contains nutritions like carnitine, taurine and selenium. The concentration of selenium in raw fresh cod fillet and raw fresh pilot whale meat is 28µg/100g and 185µg/100g. The whale's blubber is rich in vitamin D, which around half of the elderly population and many amongst the younger generations in the Faroe Islands are lacking. Reasons for this can be changes from traditional food to pizza, chicken, etc. The fat of sea mammals provide excellent sources of vitamins A, D and E.|$|E
500|$|Hensleigh {{found the}} {{rewriting}} process {{to be too}} difficult and dropped out, and felt he [...] "wasted nine months in pre-production". It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed [...] "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure {{if this was a}} science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie." [...] France was writing the script on fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for Hulk was to start in April 2000.|$|E

2500|$|On December 4, 1968, Womack {{was traded}} to the Houston Astros for outfielder Dick Simpson. He {{appeared}} in 30 games for the Astros that season, going 2–1 with a 3.51 ERA.
