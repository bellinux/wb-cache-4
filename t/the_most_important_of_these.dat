5|$|Cabral {{became the}} {{military}} chief, while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were Bartolomeu Dias, Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho. They would, {{along with the}} other captains, command 13 ships and 1,500 men. Of this contingent, 700 were soldiers, although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|The hermitage notably {{has its own}} {{tradition}} of monthly and yearly ritual cycles. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> yearly ritual events (at least for the laity) are the six-day (three sets of two-day) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the Tibetan New Year (Losar) celebrations, the sixteen-day (eight sets of two-day) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the fourth Tibetan month (they attract many people from Lhasa and the surrounding districts), and a ritual and other events that take place during the “Sixth-Month Fourth-Day” pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} source of symbolism on memorials, however, is Christian imagery and icons. Religious imagery permeated many war memorials, even the secular. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> symbols was the Christian cross, a widely used symbol of hope and suffering. The cross could take multiple forms, from Catholic designs in France, to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe. Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland, partially because they avoided Catholic connotations, although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield. In France, les croix des bois, wooden crosses, became popular symbols at memorials after Roland Dorgelès's novel of the same name. German memorials made extensive use {{of the image of}} the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ, following {{in the tradition of the}} pietà. The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol, as seen in Derwent Wood's Canada's Golgotha, although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British memorials.|$|E

5|$|Captain Ernest J. King, {{who later}} rose {{to serve as}} the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, assumed command on 20 June 1930. Lexington was assigned, {{together}} with Saratoga, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. Shortly afterward, all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was when Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from an attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Despite his misgivings Berdyev kept Kinkladze in the team, {{where he}} was used as one of three {{offensive}} midfielders in a 4–2–3–1 formation. Kinkladze, with his technical style and inclination for improvisation, brought more variety to the attacking play of the team, {{in contrast to the}} restrained style of play that Berdyev favoured. He provided an assist in four consecutive matches. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was against Zenit St. Petersburg, in a match that decided a place in the following year's UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he received a recall to the Georgian national squad for friendlies against Bulgaria and Jordan. However, a muscle strain meant he missed both national team games and Rubin's final league match. He ended the 2005 season with seven assists and two goals in nine appearances for Rubin.|$|E
5|$|In Orissa, {{the goddess}} is worshipped in the lying-in {{room on the}} sixth day after {{childbirth}}, on the 21st day after childbirth and on every subsequent birthday of the child until he or she reaches the age of sixteen. Shashthi is also prescribed to be worshipped the sixth day {{of each of the}} two lunar fortnights occurring each month; as part of the vrata rites, the worship occurring on the bright fortnight of the month of Bhadrapada is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and holds the same status in Orissa as the Aranva-Shashthi ritual in Bengal. By these rites, it is believed a childless woman may gain offspring, while a mother may secure the longevity and welfare of her child by the grace of the goddess.|$|E

5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends {{the extent to which}} a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates are by far <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> compounds, which {{can be made by}} oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Oases in {{the largely}} desert region lived {{in by the}} Qedarites - such as Dedan, Tayma, and Dumah - played an {{important}} role as sites of settlement, trade, and watering-places. Dumah, a remote desert city to the west, known later as Dumat Al-Jandal and today as al-Jawf, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> sitting as it did between the empires of Babylonia and Assyria. Serving as the base for Qedarite religious ceremonies, Dumah's strategic position on the north-south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires, though Dumah and the Qedarites were closer in both geographical and political terms to Babylonia. Those coming from the south and wishing to access Mesopotamia were obliged to pass through Dumah, which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest, leading to the city of Damascus, and from there, on to Assyria and Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} poor results of XXIBomber Command's {{precision}} bombing campaign. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces {{often had to}} pass through severe weather fronts between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXIBomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors {{reduced the number of}} aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of launching and recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was {{the appointment of}} Robert Burnell as chancellor, {{a man who would}} remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E
5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E

5|$|The race {{included}} three individual classifications {{and a team}} classification. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was the general classification. This was calculated by adding up each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Bonus seconds were awarded for top-three placings in each stage (10 seconds for the first rider, 6 seconds for the second, 4 seconds for the third) and for placings in intermediate sprints (3 seconds for the first rider, 2 seconds for the second, 1 second for the third). The rider with the lowest cumulative time after taking bonus seconds into account {{was the leader of}} the classification and was awarded a blue and yellow jersey. (Blue and yellow are colours traditionally associated with Yorkshire.) The winner of the general classification was considered the winner of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} {{commanded by}} Barrios Leal conquered {{a number of}} Ch'ol communities. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. Mercederian friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, {{and he and his}} fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Ch'ols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Ch'ol communities. The third group, under Juan Díaz de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza of northern Petén. Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil, who remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Forest were resettled in Huehuetenango, in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Zveno-SPB saw limited but {{successful}} combat {{use during}} the German-Soviet War. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa oil pipeline. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task {{was given to the}} Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under their own power.|$|E
