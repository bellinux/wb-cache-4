5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as they play the video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{with change}} in economic/political climate and {{government}} social agendas, several cultural dispersion and literacy {{organizations have been}} founded in the country, chiefly with the financial support of the Spanish government. The country has one university, the Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial (UNGE), with a campus in Malabo and a Faculty of Medicine located in Bata on the mainland. In 2009 the university produced the first 110 national doctors. The Bata Medical School is supported principally {{by the government of}} Cuba and staffed by Cuban medical educators and physicians. Equatorial Guinea predicts <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> enough national doctors in the country to be self-sufficient within the next five years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} whether {{countries}} {{which do not}} manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, {{will be able to}} purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} with manual typesetting, {{the problem of}} justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX, which, provided that good points for line breaking have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words {{to fill in the}} line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many line breaking algorithms use a first-fit approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> on the following lines. In comparison, the total-fit line breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.|$|E

Katie Roiphe of The New York Times said it is [...] "the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world". However, she criticized {{that it was not}} as [...] "impeccably plotted" [...] as The Hunger Games. Bob Minzesheimer of USA Today gave the book three out of four stars. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp described it as [...] "an entirely gripping read".|$|E

500|$|For {{more than}} 40 years, {{debate over the}} {{development}} of a rail system in Honolulu has been a major point of contention in local politics, especially leading into the 2008, 2012, and 2016 election cycles. Proponents of the system say it will alleviate worsening traffic congestion, already among the worst in the United States. [...] They assert that the urban agglomeration in south Oahu is ideally suited to rail as it is constrained by mountains to a narrow strip along the coast, which has resulted in the fourth highest population density in the US. [...] Rail opponent and freewway advocate Panos Prevedouros has questioned its cost effectiveness compared to alternatives and claims <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> marginal impact on future congestion and that new roads will therefore still be required.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{defined the}} objects of the {{expedition}} in his initial public appeal: [...] "The main objective of this expedition is to reach the South Pole, and to secure for The British Empire the honour of this achievement." [...] There were other objectives, both scientific and geographical; the scientific work was considered by chief scientist Wilson as {{the main work of}} the expedition: [...] "No one can say <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> only been a Pole-hunt... We want the scientific work to make the bagging of the Pole merely an item in the results." [...] Wilson hoped to continue investigations, begun during the Discovery expedition, of the penguin colony at Cape Crozier, and to fulfil a programme of geological, magnetic and meteorology studies on an [...] "unprecedented" [...] scale. There were further plans to explore King EdwardVII Land, a venture described by Campbell, who was to lead it, as [...] "the thing of the whole expedition", and Victoria Land.|$|E

A product listed as having an HDMI version does not necessarily mean <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> all of the features that are listed for that version, since some HDMI features are optional, such as deep color and xvYCC (which is branded by Sony as [...] "x.v.Color"). [...] Note that with the release of the version 1.4 cable, the HDMI Licensing LLC group (which oversees the HDMI standard) will require that any reference to version numbers be removed from all packaging and advertising for the cable. Non-cable HDMI products starting on January 1, 2012 will no longer be allowed to reference the HDMI number and will be required to state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements.|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} the seventeenth season of The Simpsons, Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{noted that he}} thought the show had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, and added that the stronger episodes in the later seasons are that ones that [...] "satirize topical issues", giving [...] "The Monkey Suit" [...] as an example. Similarly, Fort Worth Star-Telegram staff writer Robert Philpot commented that [...] "Even in its weak seasons, this show has always been good {{for at least one}} belly laugh per episode. Not this year [...] Aside from an installment that took on the evolution -vs.-creationism edge {{and a couple of other}} bits, the satirical edge has really dulled, making the announcement <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> at least two more seasons a cause for concern rather than celebration." [...] In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons" [...] the scene from the episode in which [...] "Flanders is flabbergasted that the science museum's exhibit on the origins of man both highlights evolution and makes light of creationism — and, to top it all, has a unisex bathroom." ...|$|E
