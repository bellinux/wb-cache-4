40|$|To the devoted {{connoisseur}} of skeptic-versus-believer debates, the argu-ment {{over the}} ‘Rendlesham Incident ’ of December 1980 {{has become a}} classic of its kind. The case was early dubbed ‘Britain’s Roswell’—an appropriate sou-briquet, for claims and counter-claims about both cases have unfolded along strikingly similar lines over the years. Believers and star witnesses have elabo-rated the story, some in fantastical ways, while intrepid truth-seekers with nothing to gain—decried in the trade as fact-shy debunkers and government shills—keep digging up bits of evidence that indicate nothing anomalous happened. One phase of this decades-long debate revolved around the suggestion—and {{it was only a}} suggestion, not a ‘claim’—by the former USAF law enforcement o!-cer, retired Senior Master Sergeant Kevin Conde: that a prank he played while on patrol at Woodbridge may have been be-hind one feature of the case. Brie"y stated, Conde—then a Technical Sergeant—on one occasion adapted a USAF police car’s fancy lighting system to generate a brilliant display of coloured illuminations in a foggy night sky. This could have created the impression that mysterious beams of light were being shone not up from, but down onto, the Woodbridge base from above. Conde was not sure, but thought it possible that he had perpetrated his jape at the time Lt Col Charles Halt and his party were stumbling around in the dark in Rendle-sham Forest. If so, these exchanges, on the <b>tape-recorded</b> <b>commentary</b> that Halt made at the time, make sense: LT COL HALT: Now we’re observing {{what appears to be a}} beam coming down to the ground. M/SGT BALL: Look at the colours [...] . shit. LT COL HALT: This is unreal. [Break in recording...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} legal writing {{as it was}} represented in legal memoranda prepared by first-semester law students at. 12 different law schools. The study {{was based on the}} cumulative judgments of the instructors and professors of law in those institutions, humanities specialists at the Educational Testing Service, and two legal consultants. A taxonomy of the elements of the legal memorandum was developed from annotations and written and <b>tape-recorded</b> <b>commentaries</b> on 237 legal memoranda written by the law students. Ratings of the overall quality of the importance of specific elements of the legal memoranda were conducted on multiple occasions by different judges. Statistical analyses of the rating data revealed some disagreement among legal writing instructors with respect of the overall quality of the legal memoranda and with respect to the elements that were strong or weak.

A taxonomy of the elements of the legal memorandum was developed from annotations and written and <b>tape-recorded</b> <b>commentaries</b> on 237 legal memoranda written by the law students. Ratings of the overall quality and of the importance of specific elements of the legal memoranda were conducted on multiple occasions by different judges. Statistical analyses of the rating data revealed some disagreement among legal writing instructors with respect to the overall quality of the legal memoranda and with respect to the elements of them that were either strong or weak. Despite these disagreements, it was possible to determine in the aggregate what elements of the legal memoranda were most important and what relative weight each has in the judgments of the instructors and professors. It was also possible to identify combinations of elements that formed factors important in determining the quality of legal memoranda. Computer analyses of the memoranda indicated differences between the student memoranda and other kinds of writing, particularly with respect to the greater use of passive voice and nominalizations in the student memoranda, but the computer variables did not correlate significantly with global quality ratings of the memoranda. Although no significant sex differences were found in the global quality ratings, differences favoring females were observed for several taxonomy elements...|$|R
