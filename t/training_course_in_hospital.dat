Herrick, a noted photographer, is planning an ambitious expansion." [...] He then quoted Herrick: [...] "Our five years’ experience during the war in military hospitals has demonstrated how photography can fill the need for a stimulating, even exciting, activity which relieves the monotony of hospital life. We are firmly convinced that it not only helps men get well, but gives them an enjoyable hobby they can continue when they leave the hospital. We hope it can be carried on in every military and veterans’ hospital in the country." [...] Later in the decade, Herrick authored a book entitled [...] Outline for <b>Training</b> <b>Course</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hospital</b> Rehabilitation Photography.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{efficient}} and optimum application of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterile supplies {{plays a key}} role in controlling and extirpation of infections. Hospitals are considered as a source of infection transmitting center because of their special situation. The current study was conducted to investigate all kinds of disinfectants used <b>in</b> Tabriz <b>hospitals.</b> Material and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted on seven important <b>hospitals</b> of Tabriz <b>in</b> March 2017. A questionnaire about disinfectants was filled. By visiting infection controlling units, environmental health, disinfectants and antisepsis warehouse and different parts of the hospitals, and performing interviews, the required information was collected and analyzed. Results: The results of this study demonstrated that each hospital used special kinds of antiseptics according to individual services; although there were some similarities. About 57 % of the <b>hospitals</b> <b>in</b> this study used only domestic disinfectant products and others used both imported and domestic products. In the studied hospitals,Sodium Hypochlorite, Alcohol, Saya sept HP and Deconex 53 plus were the most common used disinfectants. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that although holding environmental health <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> is part of operational plans of the infection control committee, but since ward assistants and housekeepers perform disinfecting, increasing the awareness of the staff about the incidence and prevalence of nosocomial infections, the importance, dangers, human and financial losses related to these diseases and the effective role of these staff in proper removing of environmental pathogens and reducing nosocomial infections possibility are expected to be felt...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the satisfaction of}} individuals with atrophic maxilla, rehabilitated with fixed dental prostheses, anchored on zygomatic implants, with variables being the anesthetic procedure: general anesthesia, or local with sedation. Materials and Methods: By means of the clinical record charts from the <b>Training</b> <b>Course</b> <b>in</b> Advanced <b>Hospital</b> Surgeries for Implant Dentists conducted at the Campinas-SP unit of the São Leopoldo Mandic School of Dentistry, 30 individuals were randomly selected. They had zygomatic implant placement surgeries performed, and were rehabilitated with fixed implant supported complete dentures, between the years 2005 and 2011. One group of 15 individuals underwent surgery <b>in</b> <b>hospital,</b> under general anesthesia. The other 15 were treated in the post-graduation clinic at the School of Dentistry, under local anesthesia and sedation. Results: From the emotional point of view, the Wilcoxon test revealed that irrespective of the anesthesia procedure used, {{at the beginning of}} treatment, the emotional condition of individuals differed from that verified after conclusion of the treatment (p <  0. 0001). Conclusion: There was no {{difference between the two groups}} as regards the anesthetic procedure. General satisfaction was high; there was emotional improvement after conclusion of the treatment, thus improving the quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{a recent}} {{increase}} in activities to promote evidence-based practice (EBP), {{it was unclear}} how Malaysian hospital practitioners received this new approach in medicine. This study examines their confidence and perceptions on EBP. Findings We conducted cross-sectional surveys using a self-administered questionnaire during two EBP <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> <b>in</b> two Malaysian <b>hospitals</b> <b>in</b> January and June 2007. Our subjects (n = 144) were doctors and nursing and allied health staff (NAH) participating <b>in</b> the EBP <b>courses.</b> Our questionnaire covered three domains: confidence and understanding (six items), attitude (five items) and barriers to practice (four items). We presented simple descriptive statistics, including the sum ratings and the proportions with different responses for each item, and compared different groups using Mann-Whitney U test for scaled ratings and Chi-square test for dichotomous responses. Ninety-two doctors and 52 NAH staff completed the surveys. Overall, doctors expressed slightly higher confidence on EBP compared to NAH staff. Out of a maximum sum rating of 27 over six items, doctors reported an average of 18. 3 (SD 3. 2) and NAH staff reported an average of 16. 0 (SD 3. 4), p = 0. 002. Doctors were also more positive in their views on EBP. For example, 67. 4 % of doctors disagreed, but 61 % of NAH staff agreed that "the importance of EBP in patient care is exaggerated", and 79. 3 % of doctors disagreed, but 46. 2 % of NAH staff agreed that "EBP is too tedious and impractical". Similar responses were observed for other items in the domain. Doctors and NAH staff shared similar concerns on barriers to evidence-based practice. The highest proportions considered poor facilities to access evidence a barrier (76 % of doctors and 90 % of NAH), followed by poor awareness of evidence (62 % of doctors and 70 % of NAH) and time constraints (63 % of doctors and 68 % of NAH), p = 0. 09 for the combined rating of four items in the domain. Conclusions The findings of our survey suggest a need for greater efforts in promoting EBP among Malaysian hospital practitioners especially for NAH staff. From the responses based on the barriers to EBP, improving facilities for accessing evidence and promoting more user-friendly resources to address time constraints {{appear to be the}} priorities. </p...|$|R
