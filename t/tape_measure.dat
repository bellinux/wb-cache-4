5|$|At {{the end of}} April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, {{with the}} Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself {{swinging}} the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> home that sent the ball {{completely out of the}} Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, {{and by the end of}} the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.|$|E

25|$|A <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> or {{measuring}} tape is a flexible form of ruler. It {{consists of a}} ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or metal strip with linear-measurement markings. The design on which most modern spring tape measures are built was invented and patented by a New Haven, Connecticut resident named Alvin J. Fellows on July 14, 1868.|$|E

25|$|Calipers are {{hand tools}} {{designed}} to precisely measure {{the distance between}} two points. Most calipers have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These calipers can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 μm). Different types of calipers have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> is often used.|$|E
25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible <b>tape</b> <b>measure,</b> position the tape at the outside of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the breasts are not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose breasts are firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E

500|$|Designed by {{architect}} Jerry McDevitt, {{the station}} has an arched vault ceiling that {{is meant to}} reflect the area's historic buildings. The platform level also makes extensive use of red and gray granite, matching the King County Courthouse and former Public Safety Building, and railings that resemble s and hanging lamps. Artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler created the station's two [...] "artifact clocks", which hang from the mezzanine {{at each end of}} the platform. The north mezzanine clock uses materials from modern construction, including granite, steel beams, and electrical wires; the south mezzanine clock incorporates artifacts found during construction dating back to the city's early history, including cobblestones, brick, and cast-iron pipes. Both clocks use various tools used during construction, including a handsaw and industrial-size <b>tape</b> <b>measure,</b> for the clock face's numerals.|$|E

2500|$|This {{also leads}} to {{understanding}} a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are [...] "nowhere differentiable". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot {{be measured in}} traditional ways. To elaborate, in {{trying to find the}} length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a <b>tape</b> <b>measure.</b> But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.|$|E

2500|$|Miniature [...] wargaming is a {{recreational}} hobby where players simulate a battle, which is played out using small figurines {{to represent the}} land, sea and/or air units involved. Many miniatures games are played on a floor or tabletop, with terrain represented by miniature scenery (hills, forests, roads, fences, etc.). Movement of the miniatures is regulated using a measuring device such as a ruler, <b>tape</b> <b>measure,</b> cut sticks or other prepared standardized-length instruments. However, like boardgames, miniature games can also be played using gridded terrain (demarcated into squares or hexagons) or even gameboards.|$|E
2500|$|The luxury {{version of}} the Compact was {{presented}} in a gift box, it was priced at a guinea and became a contemporary collector's item, tending to be little-used due to impracticality. The assemblage included a thin and delicate 6-inch - later 8-inch - <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> {{in place of the}} grip band. [...] On this luxury version the tape-measure assembly caused the centre of the gadget to rotate independently, making it difficult for adult fingers to grip the remaining part of the stable outer skin to turn the main assemblage for use as a row counter. Some of the counters in this range featured pearlised plastic outer skins in various pastel colours.|$|E

Additional tools are convenient for keeping stitches counted, measuring crocheted fabric, or making related accessories. Examples include cardboard cutouts, which {{can be used to make}} tassels, fringe, and many other items; a pom-pom circle, used to make pom-poms; a <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> and a gauge measure, both used for measuring crocheted work and counting stitches; a row counter; and occasionally plastic rings, which are used for special projects.|$|E
2500|$|Mantle {{was arguably}} the {{greatest}} offensive threat of any center fielder in baseball history. [...] He {{has the highest}} career OPS+ of any center fielder {{and he had the}} highest stolen base percentage in history {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] In addition, compared to the four other center fielders on the all-century team, he had the lowest career rate of grounding into double plays (by far) and he had the highest World Series on-base percentage and World Series slugging percentage. [...] He also had an excellent 0.984 fielding percentage when playing center field. Mantle was noted for his ability to hit for both average and power, especially <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> home runs. He hit 536 MLB career home runs, batted [...]300 or more ten times, and is the career leader (tied with Jim Thome) in walk-off home runs, with a combined thirteen, twelve in the regular season and one in the postseason.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger's {{official}} {{height of}} 6'2" [...] (1.88m) {{has been brought}} into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he {{was measured to be}} 6'1.5" [...] (1.87m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. However, in 1988 both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader. As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, [...] "settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is" [...] by using a tailor's <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words [...] "Need a lift?" [...] on the five-foot-five inch (165cm) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5'10" [...] (1.78m) and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, Men's Health magazine stated his height was 5'10".|$|E
