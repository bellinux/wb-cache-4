500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
