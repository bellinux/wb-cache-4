40|$|Multi-agent {{systems can}} be viewed as organisations of {{individual}} agents. Designing an agent organisation is a complex process involving defining the structural relationships among agents, the lines of inter-agent communication, and the agent functionality. Existing approaches to agent organisation design are difficult to apply in practice since they require the human designer to take design decisions while working at a low level of abstraction. This paper aims at contributing to semi-automating the agent organisation design process. Towards this aim, a role algebra capturing a number of basic relations among roles is formally defined and its semantics are described based on a two-sorted algebra. The use of the role algebra is demonstrated by an example from a <b>telephone</b> <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> teams case stud...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{realistic}} multi-agent {{systems is}} a complex process, which involves specifying not only the functionality of individual agents, but also the authority relationships and lines of communication existing among them. In other words, designing a multi-agent system refers to designing an agent organisation. Existing methodologies follow {{a wide variety of}} approaches to designing agent organisations, but they do not provide adequate support for the decisions involved in moving from analysis to design. Instead, they require designers to make ad hoc design decisions while working at a low level of abstraction. We have developed RAMASD (Role Algebraic Multi-Agent System Design), a method for semi-automatic design of agent organisations based on the concept of role models as first-class design constructs. Role models represent agent behaviour, and the design of the agent system is done by systematically allocating roles to agents. The core of this method is a formal model of basic relations between roles, which we call role algebra. The semantics of this role-relationships model are formally defined using a two-sorted algebra. In this paper, we review existing agent system design methodologies to highlight areas where further work is required, describe how our method can address some of the outstanding issues and demonstrate its application to a case study involving <b>telephone</b> <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> teams. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We propose and {{evaluate}} novel reliable multicast protocols that combine active <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> (a. k. a. local recovery) and parity encoding (a. k. a. {{forward error correction}} or FEC) techniques. We show that, compared to other <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> protocols, our protocols require less buffer inside the network, maintain the low bandwidth requirements of previously proposed <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> / FEC combination protocols, and {{reduce the amount of}} FEC processing at repair servers, moving more of this processing to the end-hosts. We also examine <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> / FEC combination protocols in an environment where loss rates differ across domains within the network. We find that <b>repair</b> <b>services</b> are more effective than FEC at reducing bandwidth utilization in such environments. Furthermore, adding FEC to a <b>repair</b> <b>services</b> protocol not only reduces buffer requirements at repair servers, but also reduces bandwidth utilization in domains with high loss, or in domains with large populations of receivers.

40|$|This study investigates whether quality {{management}} has developed {{to such an}} extent that retailers, <b>service</b> <b>repair</b> organisations and consumers are satisfied with product and <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> quality provided by South African manufacturing companies. To investigate these aspects, the colour television industry has been selected because it contains various manufacturing companies of varying sizes and characters, employing different quality policies and performances. It offers relatively standardised products and services, which facilitates intercompany comparisons and employs a simple flow type assembly line process that is representative of other mass production industries. The hypotheses are tested by interviewing four selected populations by means of carefully constructed questionnaires, namely a retail population, a <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> population, a consumer population and a manufacturing population. The empirical results are statistically evaluated in terms of the various manufacturers ability to provide satisfactory product and <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> quality. Consumers and <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> organisations are selected because they represent a broad spectrum of the population with varying, but important opinions on product and <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> quality. Retailers selling colour television receivers are also selected as they play an important role in the management of quality and vary from small independent retailers to large chain stores and discounters. The results obtained from this study show that: • there is a need from the retailers, <b>service</b> <b>repair</b> organisations and consumers for the South African manufacturers to improve the quality of colour television receivers • there is a need by the consumers and the retailers for the manufacturers to improve their <b>repair</b> <b>service</b> quality • there is a need to improve the quality control procedures employed by the colour television manufacturers.
