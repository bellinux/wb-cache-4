5|$|A 2016 {{calculation}} of the half-lives of the isotopes of unbiunium from 290Ubu to 339Ubu suggested that <b>those</b> <b>from</b> 290Ubu to 303Ubu would not be bound and would decay through proton emission, <b>those</b> <b>from</b> 304Ubu through 314Ubu would undergo alpha decay, and <b>those</b> <b>from</b> 315Ubu to 339Ubu would undergo spontaneous fission. Only the isotopes from 309Ubu to 314Ubu would have long enough alpha-decay lifetimes to be detected in laboratories, starting decay chains terminating in spontaneous fission at moscovium, tennessine, or ununennium. This would present a grave problem for experiments aiming at synthesising isotopes of unbiunium if true, because the isotopes whose alpha decay could be observed {{could not be reached}} by any presently usable combination of target and projectile. Calculations in 2016 and 2017 by the same authors on elements 123 and 125 suggest a less bleak outcome, with alpha decay chains from the more reachable nuclides 300–307Ubt leading down to bohrium or nihonium; in particular, 304Ubt could be synthesised in the reaction 249Bk(58Fe,3n)304Ubt and would alpha decay through 300Ubu, 296Uue, and 292Ts to the known 288Mc and 284Nh, though the cross-section would likely be extremely low. It has also been suggested that cluster decay might be a significant decay mode in competition with alpha decay and spontaneous fission in the region past Z = 120, which would pose yet another hurdle for experimental identification of these nuclides.|$|E
