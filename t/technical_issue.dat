5|$|In Australia, a <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> arose {{with the}} royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating}} in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E
5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is most noticeable with the buttress, where the receding edges are over half again the size {{of those on the}} front sides. In addition, the breadth of the buttress contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's auction of Neff's land to Pennoyer. The case would become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} <b>technical</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
5|$|In LMP2, Rast used {{intermediate}} tyres {{before making}} a pit stop for full wet tyres and recorded a lap time of two minutes and 7.374 seconds which gave him and co-driver Roman Rusinov a pole-setting two-lap average time of two minutes and 8.479 seconds. The two drivers were 1.1 seconds faster than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Ligier JS P2 of Pipo Derani and Chris Cumming. Derani set the category's fastest individual lap which was 0.059 second's faster than Rast. The No. 43 RGR Sport team qualified in third with both SMP Racing cars rounding out the top five LMP2 qualifiers. Sam Bird and Davide Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, were the fastest LMGTE Pro drivers with a two-lap average time of two minutes and 12.440 seconds. They qualified 1.3 seconds in front of Richard Lietz and Michael Christensen in Dempsey-Proton Racing's No. 77 Porsche. Mücke and Pla in Ford Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 66 car took third despite Pla going into the Stowe corner gravel trap late in the session. Their sister No. 67 GT and the KCMG Porsche rounded out the top five class qualifiers. Calado recorded a time of two minutes and 11.589 seconds, and, after Bruni got into the car, {{he was unable to}} record a lap time and returned to a pit lane with an engine bay <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> and started {{from the back of the}} overall field. Bachler and Khaled Al Qubaisi took the pole position in LMGTE Am, their first in the series, 2.297 seconds ahead of the second-place qualifier, KCMG's No. 78 car. Paolo Ruberti in Larbre Competition's No. 50 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R held the class pole position in the early part of the session but the team fell to third following the handover to co-driver Yutaka Yamagishi.|$|E
50|$|On 3 September 2013, Creative Assembly {{released}} Total War: Rome II. The game uses {{an updated}} Warscape engine and suffered from <b>technical</b> <b>issues</b> shortly after release which {{eventually led to}} Creative Assembly's Creative Director, Mike Simpson, apologising publicly to fans for the widespread <b>technical</b> <b>issues.</b> In the ten months following release, Creative Assembly released fourteen patches for the game, solving most <b>technical</b> <b>issues</b> and balancing gameplay. As of July 2014, the game currently stands at a rating of 76/100 on Metacritic by critics and 4.1/10 by users.|$|R

25|$|On November 10, 2009, MRM-2 was {{successfully}} launched, docking with the ISS on the 12th, {{while on the}} same day the Delta-IV rocket team announced that they had delayed their launch to a future date, allowing the shuttle to gain additional launch opportunities {{at the end of the}} window if it required. Atlas V's launch with the Intelsat 14 was scrubbed on the 14th due to a <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> requiring a rollback. The scrub, lasting more than 24 hours, meant that Atlantis also avoided a possible postponement of its launch slipping into November 17, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} accidentally {{released}} 24 hours early by HBO Nordic. The episode was eventually taken down, but the pirated copy was released to torrent websites. Reacting to the leak, an official HBO spokesperson said, [...] "This past Sunday's episode was made available {{early on the}} HBO Nordic platform temporarily due to a <b>technical</b> <b>issue,</b> at which time {{it seems to have}} been copied.

Upon release in the United Kingdom, a <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> rendered the game unplayable for some players, booting them from the game with an error message that the [...] "downloadable content is corrupt."

500|$|In May 1996, Parker {{constructed}} a 10-minute trailer of Evita that was {{shown at the}} 1996 Cannes Film Festival for reporters, film distributors and critics. Despite a minor <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> with the film projector's synchronization of the sound and picture, the trailer received positive response. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, said, [...] "If the preview {{is representative of the}} finished film, Argentina can wipe away its tears." [...] Barry Walters of The San Francisco Examiner stated, [...] "Rather than showing the best moments from every scene, the trailer concentrates on a few that prove what Madonna, Banderas and Pryce can do musically. The results are impressive." [...] Evita premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on December 14, 1996, the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, Ireland, on December 19, 1996, and the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, London, on December 20, 1996.|$|E
500|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. At the beginning of the first part of qualifying (Q1), Mercedes sent both their drivers out on the faster super-soft compound, while Ferrari stayed on the slower soft tyres. Even though Ferrari eventually decided to give both their drivers out on the faster tyres {{towards the end of the}} session, Sebastian Vettel aborted his last flying lap, believing his time to be sufficient for proceeding into the next round, only for Jenson Button to set a time to relegate Vettel into 16th place on the grid, eliminating him from qualifying. Vettel would later describe his and the team's judgement as [...] "a small mistake with a big consequence". Fernando Alonso in the other McLaren did not make the cut, after a puncture on his last lap left him without a chance at a faster time, while Marcus Ericsson was held up by a <b>technical</b> <b>issue,</b> qualifying 18th. Both Manor Marussia drivers were eliminated at the bottom of the standings, with Will Stevens 1.137 seconds ahead of his teammate Roberto Merhi.|$|E
500|$|The delay {{from the}} initial summer time frame was widely {{reported}} as being due to a <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> in development. David Reeves, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), stated {{that it was a}} technical problem with the game that they were yet to solve. Reports soon emerged that the game had failed epilepsy testing, and that {{it would have to be}} re-engineered before it could be released. These reports were addressed by a SCEE representative, who stated that the delay was due to numerous improvements and added features, which included the reverse tracks, four extra ships, two new heads-up displays, the addition of two-player offline split screen mode, and trophy support. Addressing the reports of health issues, they affirmed that they [...] "take consumer safety very seriously and monitor it very carefully". A comparison video between the preview and final builds later showed greatly toned down equaliser visuals in the game's [...] "Zone Mode". The issues were confirmed when the Wipeout HDs director, Tony Buckley, spoke about the tests, saying that although he felt the tests were subjective and the exact issues [...] "difficult to pinpoint", they took them seriously and that the game has [...] "come out the other end alright, with a lot more content", despite their initial fears that the game would [...] "look poorer as a result".|$|E

[...] One of these libraries (RP11) was used considerably more than others, due to quality considerations. [...] One minor <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> is that male samples contain just over half as much DNA from the sex chromosomes (one X chromosome and one Y chromosome) compared to female samples (which contain two X chromosomes). The other 22 chromosomes (the autosomes) are the same for both sexes.|$|E
2500|$|A Eurobarometer poll in September 2013, which {{included}} EU countries and candidate countries as well, showed that 43% of Turks viewed the EU positively, {{as compared with}} 60% six months previously. In the same poll, 29% of Turks polled expressed support for an EU Constitution, {{the lowest level of}} support among EU countries and candidates polled. Germany says that its reservation stems from a <b>technical</b> <b>issue,</b> but Angela Merkel, an opponent of Turkish entry into the EU, has described herself as [...] "shocked" [...] after Ankara's use of overwhelming police force against mostly peaceful demonstrators.

2500|$|A major <b>technical</b> <b>issue</b> {{was that}} of frame rate. Shiny set a target of {{maintaining}} a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times. Any moment when the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that particular part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate up to where they wanted without having to reduce the resolution or increase the pixel size. According to Bruty, [...] "We {{had no idea how}} fast we could get the engine when we started. The game would run too slow if we textured everything, so some parts were just flat-shaded for speed. We did our best to make that look like a design choice, or shadows, but it was a tricky balance." ...|$|E
