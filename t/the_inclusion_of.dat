5|$|A {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} recognition of Peleinae and Patholopinae, comprising the genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E

In present work, the behavior <b>of</b> spherical non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> in type 304 stainless steel strips during multi-pass cold rolling has been simulated by 3 D finite element method and updating geometric method. <b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> is obtained under a variety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inclusion</b> sizes and positions. <b>The</b> <b>inclusions</b> elongate along rolling direction and compress along strip thickness direction, but slightly change along strip width direction.
