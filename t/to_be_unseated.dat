2500|$|Assessing {{the extent}} to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not {{successful}} in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that [...] "this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities." [...] The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent’s objectives, or to meet one’s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, “The Satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.” The opponent must be converted, {{at least as far as}} to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, for e.g. a dictator, has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> and one cannot wait to convert him. The satyagrahi would count this a partial success. For more on the meaning of “success” in nonviolence see “work vs. “work”.|$|E

50|$|The 2006 {{municipal}} election in Vaughan saw {{a number of}} major upsets {{and a number of other}} close races - contrary to past results in the city elections. Many of the incumbents were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated,</b> although all but one was re-elected.|$|E
50|$|He was {{nominated}} by the Duke of York as MP for Winchelsea; however, {{he lost the}} election. He joined the Countess of Castlemaine to bring down Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon in 1667.

50|$|A sign of Aribo's {{strength}} {{after this}} {{was that he was}} unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> by Arnulf when the latter succeeded to the German throne in 887. In 893, Arnulf appointed Engelschalk II to a portion of the Pannonian march over Aribo's head. Aribo never reconciled with Arnulf after the Wilhelimner War and his contacts with the Moravians were kept secure. After his falling out, his son Isanrich got Moravian support against Arnulf. Aribo's descendants formed the Aribonid family. They held the Archbishopric of Salzburg in the 10th century, but were pushed out of power in the Duchy of Bavaria by the Liutpoldings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} special election, Bonilla won 48 {{percent of the}} vote to Rodriguez's 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues. According to {{unofficial}} results of the Texas Secretary of State http://204.65.107.84/06decspcrun.htm?x=0&y=0&id=824, Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla's 46%. Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> by a Democrat in 10 years, since Nick Lampson's defeat of Steve Stockman in a 1996 runoff election. Interestingly, Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district.|$|E
25|$|Riders jumping low fences {{may wish}} for an {{intermediate}} length stirrup that can allow the horse some freedom of movement, while supporting the rider over the fence, and still providing enough leg for excellent communication. A rider travelling rapidly cross-country, over varying terrain while fox hunting or endurance riding, {{will also have}} an intermediate stirrup, needing to strike a compromise between mobility for the horse and the need of the rider <b>to</b> not <b>be</b> <b>unseated.</b> In the western rodeo sport of calf roping, a moderately short stirrup <b>is</b> also required <b>to</b> help the horse to sprint quickly from the box, and to allow the cowboy the freedom to swing a lariat.|$|R
50|$|After {{leaving the}} Council, Lightfoot changed his {{registration}} to the Democratic Party. Lightfoot's goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> Republican Carol Schwartz, who <b>was</b> expected <b>to</b> run for reelection.

2500|$|With one exception, the Republican ticket {{went down}} <b>to</b> defeat. Colten <b>was</b> <b>unseated</b> by the Democrat J.E.

Garrett (1922–1987), a university educator, won election as city utilities commissioner in 1974, having unseated his {{former high school}} classmate, the Democrat Fred Elzen. Four years later, Garrett took an open seat on the city council, when it converted to single-member districts.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, he {{lost his}} bid for reelection in the Democratic primary, falling to Mandela Barnes, son of a public school teacher, who had made major issues of Fields' support for the school voucher program, and Fields’ {{opposition}} to limiting interest rates charged by payday loan companies whose charges can exceed a 500% annual percentage rate. (Fields' brother Jarett, who was {{a candidate for the}} Democratic nomination in the nearby 19th District, was also defeated.) Fields was one of two veteran Milwaukee-area Democratic incumbents (the other being Peggy Krusick) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> in that August primary by challengers who argued that the incumbent was too conservative to represent the district properly.|$|E
5000|$|As {{president}} pro tempore of the Senate, Coleman became {{lieutenant governor}} {{in the summer of}} 1939, when Earl Long, who had been elected as lieutenant governor in 1936, succeeded to the governorship on the resignation of the scandal-plagued Richard W. Leche of New Orleans during a time known as the [...] "Louisiana Hayride", {{not to be confused with}} the former Country music program of the same name in Shreveport Coleman did not run for lieutenant governor in 1940, but Long sought a full term, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> by intraparty rival, Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles. Long ultimately defeated Jones in 1948 and won a second full term as well in 1956.|$|E
50|$|While in the saddle, {{the tall}} heel {{minimized}} {{the risk of}} the foot sliding forward through the stirrup, which could be life-threatening if it happened and the rider were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated.</b> There was often considerable risk that a cowboy would fall from a horse, both because he often had to ride young, unpredictable horses, but also because he had to do challenging ranch work in difficult terrain, that often meant that he could accidentally become unseated by a quick-moving horse. If a rider fell from a horse but had a boot get caught in the stirrup, there arose a very great risk that the horse could panic and run off, dragging the cowboy, causing severe injury and possible death.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Markham, Upper Canada, the son of Edward Wheler, who came from Devonshire, England, and Anna Maria Reesor. Wheler was educated in Toronto and at Victoria College in Cobourg. In 1861, he married Harriet Hamilton. Wheler was reeve for Uxbridge and warden for Ontario County. He served as {{postmaster}} of Uxbridge from 1865 <b>to</b> 1874.

5000|$|The [...] "most sensational electoral contest {{ever held}} in the East Coast" [...] {{electorate}} was held in January 1876, when mysterious pieces of cardboard were distributed by supporters of George Read in Gisborne, which hotel bars accepted as legal tender. Read, George Morris and Kelly received 215, 206 and 185 votes, with another candidate coming a distant fourth. Morris petitioned against Read's election. A parliamentary committee of enquiry determined that Read had not broken any laws by approving the initiative, but the House of Representatives resolved that Read was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> in favour of Morris, which happened later in 1876. This was the last election enquiry held by a parliamentary committee. Subsequently, these enquiries were held by the courts.|$|E
50|$|The Dexter {{government}} {{was defeated in}} the 2013 provincial election which saw the NDP collapse to only 7 seats, reducing it to third party status in the legislature behind the Liberals and Tories. This was mainly due to a near-meltdown in Halifax, the party's power base for almost two decades; the NDP went from holding 14 of the capital's 20 seats to only two. Dexter ran in Cole Harbour-Portland Valley, essentially a reconfigured version of his old seat, and lost to Liberal Tony Ince by only 21 votes. He was the first sitting premier of Nova Scotia <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> in his own riding since Ernest Armstrong in 1925. Eight {{other members of his}} cabinet were defeated. On November 16, 2013, Dexter announced he would resign as NDP leader, effective November 23, 2013.|$|E
50|$|Of {{those that}} did not {{complete}} the course only one rider, Tony Dobbin, pulled up because the horse, Direct Access, was not enjoying it, while Jason Maguire was forced to pull up Lord of Illusion when the horse bled. J. P. McNamara felt he was unlucky <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> from Heros Collonges at The Chair because his horse was baulked while Andrew McNamara confessed that Rince Ri was stopped by a loose horse falling into the ditch {{in front of him}} rather than actually refusing. Leighton Aspell was the only rider to exit the race while lying in the first half dozen when long-time leader Ballycassidy fell but he stopped short of saying that he felt they would win, merely feeling that they deserved to get round after their front running performance.|$|E
50|$|In the 1971 {{election}} campaign, the Labour Party {{claimed that}} the government was lazy and out of touch, portraying Dom Mintoff, then Leader of the Opposition, as the image of activism. However, the Borg Olivier Cabinet was incredibly active meeting, in all, 766 times from August 27, 1962 to June 1, 1971, just before the elections which <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> it; the cabinet met even on Boxing Day, sometimes morning and evening, and even on the feast day of St Paul's Shipwreck.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} unopposed at East Cork as an Anti-Parnellite MP {{in the general}} {{election}} 1892 and 1895, taking his seat in the House of Commonsin the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected unopposed as a Nationalist {{in the general election}}s 1900, 1906 and January 1910, after the reunification of the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1900. However, in December 1910 election he was opposed by William O'Brien, whose All-for-Ireland Party was strong in Co. Cork. Although Donelan defeated O’Brien by 3,173 votes <b>to</b> 1,834, he <b>was</b> <b>unseated</b> following an election petition. He then swapped seats with John Muldoon at East Wicklow, Donelan and Muldoon both being returned unopposed at by-elections in July 1911.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this uprising, it {{occurred}} to many Wei officials that Sima Yi and his clan were serious about affairs, most likely because the Wei court was seen as being divided into those supported the Simas and those who <b>were</b> still loyal <b>to</b> the Cao imperial family. The revolt also had a strong influence on the subsequent second and third rebellions in Shouchun, as they were all inspired by the same cause, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>unseat</b> the Simas and restore the monarchy.|$|R
50|$|America's Funniest Home Videos {{became an}} instant hit with audiences, with the {{original}} special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week. When it debuted as a weekly Sunday night series in January 1990, the show averaged an 18.0 rating/27 share, finishing at 16th place. It placed within Nielsen's Top 5 highest-rated weekly series within weeks of its debut; by March 1990, AFHV became the #1 primetime series for a short time, causing CBS' 60 Minutes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> for the top spot in the Nielsen ratings {{for the first time}} in 12 years. Indeed there was at least one week in 1990 when America's Funniest Home Videos, when put in the same time slot as 60 Minutes, actually beat 60 Minutes for a win in the time slot. AFHV finished the 1989-90 season in the Top 10 most watched shows, with an approximate average of 38 million viewers for each episode.|$|E
50|$|Anthony first ran in Richmond in 1993, {{losing to}} Labor {{incumbent}} Neville Newell—the {{first time that}} a member of the Anthony family had lost an election. He sought a rematch in 1996, and defeated Newell as part of the Coalition's decisive win that year. However, due to demographic changes over the previous two decades that made Richmond much more compact and urban, Anthony was never able to establish nearly as secure a hold on the seat as his father and grandfather had possessed. He barely held onto his seat in 1998 (against Newell) and 2001, surviving both times on One Nation preferences. In 2004, he was defeated by Labor's Justine Elliot, becoming the only Coalition MP from a rural electorate to lose his seat and the first member of the Anthony family <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unseated</b> at an election. On the seventh count, Elliot picked up a large flow of Green preferences, allowing her to defeat Anthony by 301 votes.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} believed he succeeded Mardarije Kornečanin, mentioned between 1640 and 1659. The Cetinje see seems <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unseated</b> from 1660 until early 1662, when an unnamed Metropolitan of Cetinje is mentioned in a source from the Bay of Kotor. Boljević is mentioned in sources from 1673, 1675, 1682 and 1685. He funded {{the construction of}} water reservoir in Hilandar before being ortinated as Vladika. It has been theorized that it was Boljević who was mentioned in 1662 (by I. Stjepčević and P. Kovijančić). If he indeed had taken the seat in 1662, it means that he (as the Metropolitan) {{was one of two}} arbiters in the feud between harambaša Lazarić and Karučan from Crmnica, mentioned on November 2, 1662; as Boljević was from Crmnica, this has been taken as proof. It would also mean that he was active during the Cretan War (1645-69), in which many hajduks (brigands) from the region of Montenegro participated in, {{in the service of the}} Republic of Venice. A notable leader was Bajo Pivljanin.|$|R

50|$|Gram {{belonged to}} the Conservative Party. When the first cabinet Stang assumed office in 1889, Gram was {{appointed}} Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm by Prime Minister Emil Stang. He served this position until the resign of Stang's government in 1891. He was again Prime Minister in Stockholm during Stang's government from 1893. By 1895 this government had become weak due to internal conflicts. Gram was the architect of a new cabinet with Francis Hagerup as Prime Minister. This lasted from 1895 <b>to</b> 1898, but <b>was</b> <b>unseated</b> following the 1898 general election. During his last two tenures as Prime Minister in Stockholm, Gram had taken a moderate stance towards the union between Sweden and Norway, which many wanted to abolish.
