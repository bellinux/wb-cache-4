5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a little {{information}} by Ammianus. He reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> flanks of each line, front and reserve, were held by two auxilia regiments and {{the centre of the}} reserve line was held by the Primani legion. A possible order of battle that fits the available evidence is shown in the diagram of the battle.|$|E
5|$|In two 1960s {{decisions}} collectively {{known as}} forming the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the Court established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to petition prohibited {{the application of}} antitrust law to statements made by private entities before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor's building permit without being subject to Sherman Act liability.|$|E

5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to representation {{in some circumstances}} is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature {{with the notion of}} separation of powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to form associations {{may also}} be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration {{of which has been}} cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote is {{an implied}} {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore {{it is the}} courts that ultimately determine {{the meaning of the}} Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Many lakes {{had several}} land owners, however, and {{following}} disagreements over Fresh Pond, the lawyer Simon Greenleaf was charged to adjudicate a solution in 1841. Greenleaf decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to harvest ice would be divided up in proportion {{with the amount}} of the shore line owned by the different claimants; from then onwards, the rights to harvest ice could be bought and sold and the value of land adjacent to sites such as Fresh Pond increased rapidly, with one owner who purchased land at $130 ($2,500 in 2010 terms) an acre (0.4 hectares) in the 1820s refusing an offer of $2,000 ($44,000) an acre by the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Hashim was the {{foremost}} {{man of his}} day, and demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> be transferred from the clan of Abd ad-Dar to his clan. Those who supported Hashim and his brothers were the descendants of Zuhrah and Taym ibn Murrah, and all Qusai's descendants except those of the eldest line.

5|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{began in}} the 1940s {{when the number of}} elected seats in the legislature gradually increased, until a fully elected Legislative Assembly of Singapore was established in 1958. At present, Singapore legislation establishes various mechanisms that fulfil the doctrine of representative democracy. Parliamentary elections in Singapore are required to be held regularly to elect the Parliament through universal suffrage. Although the right to vote in Singapore law is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution, the Government has affirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> may be implied into the constitutional text.|$|E
5|$|Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican {{congressman from}} Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist, agreed that voting rights should be {{universal}}. In 1866, Stanton, Anthony, {{and several other}} suffragists drafted a universal suffrage petition demanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote be given without consideration of sex or race. The petition {{was introduced in the}} United States Congress by Stevens. Despite these efforts, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, without adjustment, in 1868.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application of the Bill of Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test is to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals {{in the same class}} must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an {{addendum}} stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{to freedom}} of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament, or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E

5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta {{in any way that}} would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April 1471, {{at around}} 4o'clock in the morning, both armies woke. Edward had planned {{for an early}} attack, however, and quickly roused his men to engage the Lancastrians. Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms. The morning fog was thick and the night {{movements}} of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other. Neither group was facing the other; each was offset slightly to the right. This displacement meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> end of either army could outflank the other by wrapping around the opposing left end. The Lancastrians {{were the first to}} exploit this advantage; Oxford's group quickly overwhelmed Hastings'. Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet, chased by the Lancastrians. Some of Hastings' men even reached London, spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory. Oxford's group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet. Yelling and chasing after his men, Oxford rallied 800 of them and led them back to the battle.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, Odex {{initiated}} {{legal action}} against a third Internet Service Provider, Pacific Internet. Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the personal information of about 1,000 subscribers. The closed-door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts, where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet {{did not have to}} reveal its subscribers' personal information. Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application, despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios. The decision came as a surprise to many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex the court order, he warned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E
