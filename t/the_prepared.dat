5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} <b>the</b> <b>prepared</b> ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Esophageal {{cancer is}} a common disease with {{increasing}} incidence. The most common treatment for esophageal cancer is surgical resection. The mortality rate of pneumonia after surgical resection is approximately 20 %, compared to 3 % in patients without pneumonia. <b>The</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial (preoperative inspiratory muscle training to prevent postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal resection) was designed to investigate the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and respiratory function after esophageal surgery. A process evaluation was performed alongside this trial to investigate the experiences of patients and the involved physiotherapists participating in <b>the</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial. <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the protocol of <b>the</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial, its execution any bottlenecks that may influence the outcomes of the trial. Methods: A generic qualitative approach was used. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who participated <b>the</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial and four semi-structured interviews were performed with involved physiotherapists. Results: Overall, the experiences of the patients and physiotherapists were positive, particularly on the organization and information of <b>the</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial. However, contamination bias occurred (n= 1), no measurements were performed after surgery (n= 1) and there were problems with using the device (n= 1). The Physiotherapists had problems with performing the endurance measurement and found the time investment high. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial was positively evaluated by patients and physiotherapists. <b>The</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial was performed according to protocol on most aspects, a few deviations were reported. Clinical Relevance: This is the first process evaluation of a trial which investigate the effect of IMT. This process evaluation gives more insight in the execution of <b>the</b> <b>PREPARE</b> trial. In combination with outcome of the trial, this study may lead to an improvement of the study protocol when bottlenecks will be tackled...|$|R

5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now <b>the</b> <b>prepared</b> letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of the Lika Crisis Headquarters, Tihomir Orešković, and the {{commanding}} officer of the 118th Infantry Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Mirko Norac, called a meeting of their subordinates and ordered the arrest of Serb civilians, their subsequent detention in the Perušić barracks, and killings. Sources disagree on the exact date of the meeting. According to Dasović, the meeting took place on 15 October, at approximately 9:00p.m., which he attended along with several other officials. Other sources, including the subsequent criminal inquiry and trial witnesses, indicated the meeting was held on 16 or 17 October. The courts processing the case, including the Supreme Court of Croatia, determined that the meeting took place on 17 October and that Orešković and Norac ordered those in attendance to execute civilians that had been arrested based on <b>the</b> <b>prepared</b> lists.
