In this episode, Doggett is paired with an {{enthusiastic}} young agent named Leyla Harrison who knows everything about the X-Files, when Scully goes on maternity leave. Harrison's apotheosis of Mulder and Scully leads to Doggett learning a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> But when Harrison and Doggett disappear, Mulder defies orders {{in an attempt to}} find them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} entry of the franchise, {{made up of}} four {{segments}} from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only {{in the first and}} fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open the windows to cool him down, {{despite the fact that he}} is the only one hot and there is a cold wind, and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Billen of The Times however, {{felt the}} finale was [...] "not [...] very {{exciting}} episode," [...] and [...] "conducted {{with a minimum}} of acting." [...] Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode, saying [...] "Neil Cross knows a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about ratcheting up the tension, and in the finale of the seventh series of Spooks he used both of them. And then, from somewhere, he found a third thing. And a fourth," [...] and [...] "pressure piled on pressure relentlessly throughout this brilliant finale as each new success only led to the next, even bigger problem." [...] Gimmers called the chase sequence in the episode [...] "one of the most thrilling traditional chase sequences ever seen on British TV," [...] the interplay between the characters [...] "was handled expertly," [...] and ended with [...] "already I can't wait for the next series!" ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about freewheeling banter... {{and for a}} good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I {{wanted to go back to}} get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E

Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass likened the song to {{material}} on B'Day (2006), and complemented it as a [...] "vocal tour de force with eye-popping, quotable lyrics". BET Latifah Muhammad used the words [...] "assertive, feminine, coy and direct" [...] to describe the track. Una Mullally of The Irish Times dubbed [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "simple and inoffensive". Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast felt that Beyoncé managed to execute a modern Motown sound. Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "Rocket" [...] featured [...] "a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> {{to say about the}} irresistible siren call of her butt". Claire Lobenfeld from Complex found [...] "Rocket" [...] to be more sultry {{than the rest of the}} songs on the album. Tim Finney of the same publication highlighted [...] "Rocket" [...] as a [...] "relatively classicist... sex romp slow jam" [...] and concluded, [...] " [...] gradually disintegrates into a loosely interwoven patchwork of faux-improvised exclamations and exhalations as Beyoncé determinedly roots out every possible voluptuous vocal angle on the song's preoccupations".|$|E

60|$|Once upon a time, in {{a savage}} {{country where the}} snow lies deep for many months in the year, there lived an owl and an eagle.

2500|$|In February 2014, Time was {{met with}} {{controversy}} {{for the release of}} a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto and the legend Saving Mexico (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment {{for the first time in}} 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying [...] "the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary", that [...] "American leaders could learn a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> from their resurgent southern neighbor" [...] and saying Mexicans citizens' [...] "alarms were replaced with applause". The last part proved false, when the cover immediately spawned heavy amounts of backlash on social media, becoming a meme which spawned multiple parody covers ranging from changing the legend to mock words like [...] "Selling Mexico", [...] "Slaving Mexico", [...] "Starving Mexico", [...] "Who is saving Mexico from this ass-hole?" [...] to editing Peña Nieto into clown make-up, dressed as the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, the Pope, to one featuring an old lady holding a gun with the legend [...] "Saving Mexico... pero de Peña Nieto" [...] (but from Peña Nieto). Multiple articles criticized the article, and some websites even asked Time magazine if Peña Nieto paid for the cover story. This prompted Michael Crowley, the writer of the article, to post on Twitter: [...] "Remarkable how many critics of Mexico's president seem to believe I must have literally taken a bribe to write a positive story about him".|$|E
2500|$|Radiosurgery {{garnered}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream music critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 9 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Critics' praise was often {{centered on the}} album's nostalgic sound and its catchy hooks, while Bethany Cosentino's guest appearance on track [...] "Caught in the Act" [...] was also widely applauded. Indeed, Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press called Radiosurgery [...] "focused and precise" [...] while awarding four stars out of five in her review. She noted that the album is rich on [...] "summary riffs and brisk tempos", before summarising, [...] "by refusing to settle for [...] "good enough" [...] – and by creating a homage to youthful, timeless pop punk – New Found Glory sound revitalised and relevant." [...] AbsolutePunk staff writer Thomas Nassiff described the album as containing [...] "beautiful pop-punk jammers" [...] while awarding a score of 8 out of 10. Though {{pointing out that the}} album offers nothing new to the band's catalog, he reflected [...] "New Found Glory has too many good records to call this one their best, but that doesn't really matter in the end. Comparing Radiosurgery to Sticks and Stones, New Found Glory or even Catalyst or Not Without a Fight is simply irrelevant. It's better to concentrate on what's in front of us: a hard-hitting, purely enjoyable album from South Florida's proudest sons." [...] David McLaughlin of Kerrang! magazine expressed that [...] "Radiosurgery is pretty much everything anyone could want from a New Found Glory record." [...] Awarding an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! rating, he noted the album's [...] "nostalgic 90s sound" [...] by adding, [...] "Age-old tales about lovestruck boys and girls told in three minutes via three chords, killer choruses and golden melodies. The Ramones knew a <b>thing</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> about that. So do New Found Glory. These tried and tested musical staples still make for some really special moments." [...] Tom Williams of Big Cheese magazine awarded the album five stars out of five in his review. He praised the band's [...] "mashup of bleeding heart lyrics, catchy melodies and punk rock energy" [...] before asserting, [...] "Infectious as always, professionally delivered and with a sound purpose built for partying, the album is a hit plain and simple." [...] Gregory Heaney of Allmusic awarded the album a favorable three and a half stars out of five in his review. He noted how [...] "pop-punk is becoming a lost art, a rarefied ability to sugarcoat heartache rather than embellish it, and that's exactly what New Found Glory do on this album. Without falling back on breakdowns, half-time choruses, or screaming, the band delivers 11 tracks of upbeat rock ruminations on unrequited love and heartbreak." ...|$|E
