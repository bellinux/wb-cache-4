5|$|A {{number of}} West German state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing {{the western side of}} the border.

5000|$|There {{were many}} traffic {{accidents}} {{right after the}} 730. When turning right/left on a crossing, drivers often <b>approached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side of the road, although they had <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, resulting in one bus overturning. This led to many collisions on a crossing. Larger accidents included a frontal collision of two buses.|$|R

5|$|After {{weakening}} into {{a remnant}} low, Felicia continued <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands and on August12, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on Oahu at , causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs. In addition, river flooding {{resulted in the}} closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.|$|E
5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> enemy by {{surprise}} and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E

The USS Juneau and USS Bowditch, however, both remained anchored in Sasebo, while the USS Guardian and USS Safeguard were both moved to a nearby dry dock.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the UN forces arrived at Hungnam, MacArthur had already ordered the {{evacuation}} of the US X Corps on 8 December in order to reinforce the US Eighth Army, which by then was badly depleted and retreating rapidly towards the 38th parallel. Following his orders, the ROK I Corps, the ROK 1st Marine Regiment, the US 3rd Infantry Division and the US 7th Infantry Division had also set up defensive positions around the port. Some skirmishes broke out between the defending US 7th, 17th and 65th Infantry and the pursuing PVA 27th Corps, but against the strong naval gun fire support provided by US Navy Task Force 90, the badly mauled 9th Army was in no shape <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> Hungnam perimeter.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{rotation}} of the Earth, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west. This causes tropical cyclones <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only one to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers are able <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> sharks closely and even touch {{and play with}} them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship.

5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind.

The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
