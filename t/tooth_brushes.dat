40|$|Oral {{diseases}} {{can greatly}} impact people’s life. Latinos in the U. S. have {{higher risk of}} developing caries and gingivitis than non-Hispanic whites. These diseases can be prevented by implementing oral hygiene behaviors such as <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> For this behavior to be effective, it has to evolve into a habit. Few studies have addressed <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habit formation in children, and {{only one of them}} was targeted to the Latinos. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study is}} to: 1) describe efforts Mexican immigrants parents make to teach their children to <b>brush</b> their <b>teeth,</b> and 2) identify habit formation components. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study included twenty in-depth interviews with Mexican immigrant parents. Participants were recruited in different Latino venues in Pittsburgh, PA and Philadelphia PA. The investigator conducted the interviews, which were recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded. Standard qualitative thematic analyses were performed. NVivo 10 software was used to aid the coding process. RESULTS: Parents experiences while teaching their children to <b>brush</b> their <b>teeth</b> were organized in four <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> stages: entirely dependent <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing,</b> assisted <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing,</b> road to <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> independence, and independent <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> Intention, attitudes, contextual cues, and motivation appeared to have great importance in children’s <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> learning process. Parental knowledge and sources of information available affected the initiation of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was defined as a social and familial event or as an individual event. Consistent <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> routines facilitated the compliance of the behavior. CONCLUSION: Parents’ efforts to teach their children to <b>brush</b> their <b>teeth</b> were reflected in their involvement in the development of daily <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> routines. Consistency in their routines and attitudes affected the emotional tone of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> sessions. From participants’ experiences we developed the hypothesis that there are four stages in the <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> learning process that follow a progressive pattern throughout the growth of a child and ends with a <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habit.

40|$|Regular <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> is {{considered}} an excellent preventive measure for oral plaque control. Yet despite over one hundred years of effort by dental professionals, levels of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> remain distressingly low. Evidence {{from a variety of}} studies suggests that <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> is commonly performed in a regularised, automatic (i. e., routine) manner. Here it is argued a routine can be considered a recurring sequence of behaviours produced in conjunction with a script (or group of behaviours hierarchically represented in memory), and controlled as a unit or ‘chunk’. A robust model of routine behaviour is presented, the Norman-Shallice-Cooper model, which is then applied to the example of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> behaviour, suggesting a variety of strategies for introducing <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> into daily routines. Empirical studies are also reviewed which suggest that <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> practices cluster in families. This clustering, together with the persistence of the practice throughout life, is consistent with the hypothesis that <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> typically occurs within family-based traditions.

We hypothesised that self-reported racism was associated with <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing,</b> and that this association was mediated by perceived stress and sense of control and moderated by social support. METHODS: Data from 365 pregnant Aboriginal Australian women were used to evaluate <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> behaviour, sociodemographic factors, psychosocial factors, general health, risk behaviours and racism exposure. Bivariate associations were explored and hierarchical logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> Perceived stress and sense of control were examined as mediators of the association between self-reported racism and <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> using binary mediation with bootstrapping. RESULTS: High levels of self-reported racism persisted as a risk indicator for <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> (OR 0. 51, 95 %CI 0. 27, 0. 98) after controlling for significant covariates. Perceived stress mediated the relationship between self-reported racism and tooth brushing: the direct effect of racism on <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was attenuated, and the indirect effect on <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was significant (beta coefficient - 0. 09; bias-corrected 95 %CI - 0. 166,- 0. 028; 48. 1 % of effect mediated). Sense of control was insignificant as a mediator of the relationship between racism and <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> CONCLUSIONS: High levels of self-reported racism were associated with non-optimal <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> behaviours, and perceived stress mediated this association among this sample of pregnant Aboriginal women [...] Limitations and implications are discussed.

Methods: Preschool children (332) with autism at special child care centre in Hong Kong were assigned to a test SSDHE intervention group (148 children) or a control CDHE intervention group (204 children) to learn the task of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> Performance in <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was assessed using a standardized 13 -step pro forma. Number of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> steps and number of effective <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> steps successfully completed were assessed and compared over time, and between groups in a 6 -month study. Results: The response rate to the study was 67 % (222 / 332). Over time, there were significant improvements in {{the overall number of}} <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> steps completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and the control group (p< 0. 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Early {{childhood}} caries {{remains a}} significant {{public health problem}} in Hong Kong. Parental behaviours are key to protecting children’s oral health; and yet little is known of when, how and why these develop. OBJECTIVES: A qualitative study using a Phenomenological approach was conducted with an initial objective to describe the experiences of Hong Kong parents in caring for their children; including the impact on dental caries. Subsequently, the qualitative study shifted to a Grounded Theory approach with an objective to develop a theory describing the development of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habits and to identify potential associating factors. A quantitative {{study was conducted to}} verify the theory and provide evidence of the role of these potential factors. METHODS: The qualitative study was conducted by one-to-one semi-structured interviews with parents selected by a purposive sampling procedure. Two qualitative analytical approaches were undertaken: Phenomenology and Grounded Theory. A longitudinal quantitative study on the ‘initiation’ and ‘perpetuation’ of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> among children (at age 1 who were followed up at age 2) was undertaken. The relationship of parental factors, social support, environmental stressors and child resistance factors were examined. RESULTS: The Phenomenological analysis informed the research question of ‘how <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habits are developed’. The Grounded Theory analyses identified that <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was not developed in a switch from ‘off’ to ‘on’ manner, and should be conceptualized by an ‘initiation’ and ‘perpetuation’ phase. Moreover, that multiple and interacting factors related to parents/caregivers, social support, environmental factors and child resistance influence <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habits. In addition, it informed the design of the quantitative study involving 187 parents/caregivers. Most caregivers (68 %, 128 / 187) attempted to ‘initiate’ <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> by age 1 of the child; and this was associated with family monthly income (OR 1. 65, 95 %CI, 1. 07, 2. 53, P< 0. 05). Among them, approximately half (53 %, 68 / 128) were able to ‘perpetuate’ tooth brushing; and this was found to be associated with parental self-efficacy in relation to <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> (PSE-TB scores: OR 1. 37, 95 %CI 1. 18, 1. 58, P< 0. 001) and parental distress (PSI-PD scores: OR 1. 09, 95 %CI 1. 03, 1. 16, P< 0. 01). The response rate to follow-up study was 56 %. Most (95. 3 %) attempted to ‘initiate’ <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> by age 2; and two-thirds (66 %) were able to ‘perpetuate’ <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> Perpetuation of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> was associated with parental self-efficacy in relation to <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> (PSETB scores: OR 1. 43, 95 %CI 1. 20, 1. 72, P< 0. 001). No baseline factors were associated with the development of daily <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> between age 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative study informed the research question and identified a conceptual model for the development of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> in the Hong Kong context. It illustrated the influences of parental, social support, environmental factors and child resistance in the development of <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habits. The quantitative study findings supported the qualitative findings of multiple interacting factors {{in the development of the}} <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> habits but also illustrated some limitations of the quantitative approach - highlighting the merits of the mixed methods approach. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Objectives It is very {{difficult}} for dental professionals to ob-jectively assess <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> skill of patients, because an obvious index to assess the brushing motion of patients has not been established. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quan-titatively evaluate toothbrush and arm-joint motion during <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> Materials and methods <b>Tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> motion, performed by dental hygienists for 15 s, was captured using a motion-capture system that continuously calculates the three-dimensional coordinates of object’s motion relative to the floor. The dental hygienists performed the <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> on the buccal and palatal sides of their right and left upper molars. The frequencies and power spectra of toothbrush motion and joint angles of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist were calculated and analyzed statistically. Results The frequency of toothbrush motion was higher on the left side (both buccal and palatal areas) than on the right side. There were no significant differences among joint angle frequencies within each brushing area. The inter- and intra-individual variations of the power spectrum of the elbow flexion angle when brushing were smaller than for any of the other angles. Conclusions This study quantitatively confirmed that dental hygienists have individual distinctive rhythms during <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing.</b> All arm joints moved synchronously during <b>brushing,</b> and <b>tooth</b> <b>brushing</b> motion was controlled by coor-dinated movement of the joints. The elbow generated an individual’s frequency through a stabilizing movement.

Aims and objectives: The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the presence of microorganisms in the <b>tooth</b> <b>brushes</b> and to investigate the effect of disinfectants such as chlorhexidine gluconate, sodium hypochlorite and water to decontaminate them. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one children were asked to brush their teeth for 5 days with a tooth brush. The <b>tooth</b> <b>brushes</b> were put in Robertson′s Cooked Meat broth and were observed for growth of Streptococcal microorganisms. These <b>tooth</b> <b>brushes</b> were then placed in disinfectants such as 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (Group I), 1 % sodium hypochlorite (Group II) and water (Group III) for 24 hrs and then cultured again.
