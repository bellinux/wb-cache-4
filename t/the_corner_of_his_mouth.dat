500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> [...] "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1987, Dahmer—at {{the time}} {{residing}} {{with his grandmother}} in West Allis—encountered a 25-year-old from Ontonagon, Michigan, named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded {{him to return to}} the Ambassador Hotel, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, {{he had no intention of}} murdering Tuomi, but simply intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest [...] "crushed in" [...] and [...] "black and blue" [...] with bruises. Blood was also seeping from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had absolutely no memory of having killed Tuomi, and later informed investigators that he simply [...] "could not believe this had happened." [...] To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later, he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso, then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head—were disposed of in the trash.|$|E
2500|$|Walters {{was denied}} an {{opportunity}} to tour South Africa in 1966-67 when he was conscripted to two years of National Service training, although effectively being exempted from Vietnam service in order to pursue his professional, cricketing career in Australia, and it wasn't until 1968 that {{he returned to the}} test arena. [...] In the 1968-69 series against the West Indies, Walters was injured and unavailable for the first Test match, but in the remaining four Tests he scored a Bradmanlike 699 runs, at an average of 116.5, with a highest score of 242 (in the process he became the first player to score a century and a double century in a single Test). In 1969-70 he showed a weakness against the South African fast bowlers Peter Pollock and Mike Procter, ducking while leaving his bat upright like a submarine periscope. This weakness was exploited by England's John Snow in the 1970-71 Ashes Series, who repeatedly sent down fast, short-pitched balls against Walters. Even so, Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists, 112 in the First Test and three fifties thereafter, but few runs in between, making 373 runs (37.30) in the series. Walters starred in an unofficial Test series to a Rest of the World team led by Gary Sobers that toured in 197172 as a replacement for the politically unacceptable South Africans, scoring 355 runs in four matches at an average of 71.00, with 2 centuries. He famously hit a century in a session at the WACA against England in 1974, where he hit Bob Willis for six from the last ball of the day to bring up his ton. His 250 against New Zealand in 1977 is the highest by any batsman in the number six position. Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] broke many partnerships and yielded 49 Test wickets at 29.08. He wore the large sideburns popular in the 1960s and [...] 1970s and when not on the field was seldom seen without a cigarette hanging from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> He was also famous for his Laconic humour.|$|E
60|$|At once <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clear-cut, {{sensitive}} mouth dropped dismally.|$|R
60|$|He {{wrinkled}} his forehead, {{and drew}} in <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|Hereward {{looked out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes, smiling and perplexed.|$|R
60|$|The workman {{replaced}} the pipe in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and nodded deliberately.|$|E
60|$|The sage sedately smiled, a queer incredulity just {{lurking in}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{regarded}} me for {{my opinion}} very earnestly, with his pipe in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

60|$|He looked wickedly at me out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grey eyes.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} {{slightly}} husky and strained, and a nervous twitch in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> followed speech.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} murmur of sympathy. Ralph Conyers, however, his cigar in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> smiled imperturbably.|$|E
60|$|He {{broke off}} a little abruptly. Huntley's unsympathetic face, with the big cigar in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> choked the flow of his words.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth twitched in {{the attempt}} to repress a smile.|$|R

60|$|The cobbler put {{his pipe}} in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> while he smiled, and then {{brought it back}} to its old place again; but said nothing.|$|E
60|$|McGinty {{took his}} eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> and {{proceeded}} to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin bowed, with a {{faint smile}} at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he shrugged}} his {{shoulders}} and pulled down <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|R

60|$|He left Bert on his wall, {{grave and}} pensive, with his {{cap on the}} back of his head, and a {{cigarette}} smouldering in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He {{leaned back}} in his padded chair, his hands folded in front of him, his cigar in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Arnold {{smoothed}} the paper out and read: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} other, in a drawling manner, {{for he was}} fixing a very small patch of {{sticking}} plaster on a very small pimple near <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> 'What else?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said George, {{trying a}} sort of vocal chip-shot out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{designed}} to lift his voice backwards and lay it dead inside the cab.|$|E
60|$|Jacob shook <b>his</b> head. <b>The</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth tightened. He {{spoke with}} grave seriousness.|$|R
