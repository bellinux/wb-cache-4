2500|$|Under Thomas, the {{programme}} {{developed into}} <b>a</b> miscellany <b>of</b> variety, talk, music and comedy, using whatever talent was available near the evacuated Variety Department's studios in Bristol. On occasion {{this was no}} talent at all, and Thomas later <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> edition made up {{of him and his}} co-producer playing [...] "Shove ha'penny", which had the side effect of reintroducing the game to the population.|$|R

5|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1962, whilst the first Bond film, Dr. No was being filmed nearby. The first draft of the novel was 196 pages long and called The Belles of Hell.

5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole Caves, {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the caves along {{with other members of}} the Mendip Nature Research Committee. The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting the information in the 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E
50|$|Before she met Munby, Cullwick saw {{a lavish}} musical, The Death of Sardanapalus; {{it was the}} first time went to the theatre in her life.

50|$|Old King Clancy {{is based}} on a true story. One of the show writers <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{incident}} involving a friend who had met an American celebrity with a strange collection and also a strange sex proposition.

5|$|Regardless of {{the lack}} of {{information}} about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled Women's Barracks describing a woman's experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. It <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel Spring Fire in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.|$|E
5|$|When encountering natives in the New World, Spanish explorers were {{occasionally}} <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tribe composed {{entirely of}} women. One such tale {{was related to}} Cortés {{about a group of}} Amazons supposedly living in a province called Ciguatán. Juan de Grijalva was told of Amazons during his 1518 expedition through the Tabasco region of Mexico. Nuño de Guzmán followed tales of a nation of women who lived in riches on or near the sea, women with whiter skin who were accounted goddesses by the natives. He described how they used bows and arrows, and lived in many towns. Polk characterized Guzmán as driven by lust for sex and riches—his greed and sadism were well known.|$|E
5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} settlers to the Kooser Run area <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American Indian {{battle that}} took place near Kooser Run. <b>A</b> large number <b>of</b> war arrows and spearheads have since {{been found in the}} area. The area was also crossed by participants in the Whiskey Rebellion. The park is named for John Kooser. He settled near Kooser Spring in what is now the western edge of Kooser State Park.|$|R
50|$|The MOJ is not {{required}} to inform a condemned inmate's family prior to the person's execution. Human rights organizations reported that lawyers also were not <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> execution until after the fact and that death row prisoners were held for years in solitary confinement with little contact with anyone but prison guards. Parole may not be granted for any reason, including medical and humanitarian reasons, until an inmate has served two-thirds of his or her sentence.|$|R
50|$|Captain Herman Suvorin (Anton Walbrook) is a Russian {{soldier in}} St Petersburg in 1806. He {{comes from a}} working class background, and is {{consequently}} spurned by his wealthier fellow officers. Suvorin begins gambling, playing the card game Faro. He is <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aged countess (Edith Evans), who allegedly sold her soul to the devil in exchange for success in playing Faro. Suvorin seduces her ward (Yvonne Mitchell) as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plan to learn the countess's secret of success.|$|R
5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and {{was sent}} to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dog helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. The dog would also allow men to hold onto her back while swimming them to safety. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s onwards, {{stories about}} Brown were often {{included}} in local {{histories of the}} southeast of South Australia. Examples include Elma Smith's History of Kingston published in 1950, and Kingston Flashback written by local historian Verne McLaren and published in 1970. In Smith's version, the original crime was not discussed, and {{the focus was on}} the horse ride to Adelaide, and McLaren's account split the legend into two, one about a poisoning by Brown, and another in which Brown and an accomplice cornered Aboriginal people in the Papineau caves, smoked them out and shot them. The second of McLaren's stories ended with Brown's famous ride to Adelaide to report to the police. Another account was included in Barry Durman's A History of the Baker's Range Settlement, published in 1978. Durman reproduced a newspaper article about the investigation into Brown's involvement in the murders, passed over the manner by which the murders were carried out and stated that the case was not proven, and then <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wonderful feat of horsemanship by Brown.|$|E
40|$|Threatened by Japanese colonialism, Korean nationalists {{and members}} of new religions, such as Taejong-gyo, forged scriptures and {{histories}} that <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ancient script created by the mythical founders of the Korean volk. This alleged script was used to record the earliest scripture, the Ch'onbu'gyong. <b>A</b> kabbalistic analysis <b>of</b> these scriptures would then reveal the secret history of Korea as the centre of East Asian, if not world, civilization.

50|$|An American physician, John Kirkpatrick, {{upon his}} visit to London in 1743, <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{instance}} where variolation stopped an epidemic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1738, where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred. His account {{of the success of}} variolation in Charleston helped {{to play a role in}} the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of maximum entropy production (MEP) {{is the subject}} of considerable academic study, but has yet to become remarkable for its practical applications. <b>A</b> tale is <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> instance in which a spin-off from consideration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MEP-constrained climate model at least led to re-consideration of the very practical issue of water-vapour feedback in climate change. Further, and on a more-or-less unrelated matter, a recommendation is made for further research on whether there might exist a general "rule" whereby, for certain classes of complex non-linear systems, <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> maximum entropy production is equivalent to <b>a</b> state <b>of</b> minimum entropy...|$|R

50|$|The Roman poet Ovid <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ancient {{legend in}} which Zeus and Hermes {{came to the}} Phrygian hill country {{disguised}} as mortals seeking lodging. After being turned away from a thousand homes, they found refuge in the humble cottage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elderly couple. In appreciation for the couple's hospitality, the gods transformed the cottage into a temple with a golden roof and marble columns. All {{the house of the}} inhospitable people were then destroyed. This ancient legend may be the reason that the people treated Paul and Barnabas as gods. After witnessing the healing of the cripple, {{they did not want to}} make the same mistake as their ancestors.|$|R
25|$|During {{the retreat}} southwards in 1880 from Kazan to central Asia, Grand Duke Nicolae, {{the de facto}} Czar, was <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nun who was having visions of the future.

'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'.|$|E
25|$|In both Malaysia and Indonesia, {{ghosts and}} the supernatural have long been the popular subject of stories in television, documentaries, film, and {{magazines}} like Mastika and Tok Ngah.

It <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hunchback who through supernatural means becomes handsome, but turns invisible after violating his oath. The devil offers to help achieve his worldly desires, on condition that he rapes 21 girls within 7 days.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} L.A. Takedown lay in real life. Michael Mann, the film's {{producer}} and screenwriter, cited producer, screenwriter and Chicago ex-police officer Chuck Adamson as {{an inspiration for}} the character of Vincent Hanna. Mann, who collaborated with Adamson on Miami Vice and Crime Story and several minor projects, was <b>told</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investigation Adamson partook in. In 1963, he was investigating Neil McCauley, a professional robber. According to Mann, [...] "one day they simply bumped into one another.
