25|$|We have {{mentioned}} that natural selection has not played its part {{for a long}} while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved {{through the efforts of}} hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.|$|E

[...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live.

60|$|Our thirst satisfied, we <b>turned</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> to {{filling the}} cask. It {{was not long}} before we had it more than half full, and as the cask was a twenty-gallon one, this was not bad, and would last us quite some time.|$|R
2500|$|Waiting for the Barbarians, {{an opera}} from J. M. Coetzee's novel (with the {{libretto}} by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined {{the work as}} a [...] "social/political opera", as a critique on the Bush administration's war in Iraq, a [...] "dialogue about political crisis", and an illustration of the [...] "power of art to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> toward the human dimension of history". While the opera's themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using [...] "very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it's almost classical in sound", as the conductor D. Russell Davies notes.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{object is}} a [...] "mirror of all others." [...] Our {{perception}} of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement {{and understanding of the}} world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual [...] Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.|$|E

6000|$|Having in the {{previous}} chapters treated of the subjects of ancient navigation and ships, and given some account of the boats of the present time, we now proceed to write about modern ships. In doing so, let us <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> first to:-- ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first we}} <b>turned</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> to taking prisoners; but before having left the main encampment {{a mile in}} the rear the Indians, eager for scalps, began to grow {{careless}} of what we might do, and then we paid off many an old score, although all {{could not have been}} settled had we slaughtered every last one of them.|$|R

60|$|With that {{we began}} to <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> to the clothes.
