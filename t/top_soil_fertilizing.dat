40|$|Abstract: One of {{the methods}} of sewage sludge disposal, {{which is based on}} its {{fertilizing}} properties, is its use in nature, e. g. in farming (if all the permissible standards are met). However, the sludge used for soil fertilization might also contain heavy metals, pathogenic microorganisms, thus causing contamination in soil foundation and deterioration of the conditions for development of indigenous organisms. Particular threat is posed by the exi st ence of drug-resistant microorganisms in sewage sludge. This problem has not been researched in detail yet. The authors of the present study aimed to determine qualitative changes in drug-resistant microorganisms in sandy <b>soil</b> <b>fertilized</b> with selected sewage sludge. Sewage sludge after different types of drying process (natural and solar) was added to the degraded sandy soil. The effect {{of the methods}} of sewage sludge drying on concentration of drug-resistant microorganisms in <b>soil</b> <b>fertilized</b> with the sludge was analysed. The study demonstrated that sewage sludge dried naturally in drying beds pose threat to soil environment and, potentially, to people and animals which have contact with <b>fertilized</b> <b>soils.</b> In sandy <b>soils</b> <b>fertilized</b> with these types of sewage sludge, pathogenic forms which exhibit resistance to first-line antibiotics can be found...|$|R

Two variants of compost fertilization (K 1 - 10 and K 2 - 15 g N·m- 2) were used. Additionally two variants of NPK with equivalent doses of nitrogen as an ammonium nitrate supplemented with PK as a superphosphate and potassium salt were applied.

Therefore, the long-term effect of both mineral (NH 4 NO 3) and organic (manure and GFT-compost) fertilizer applications on the soil methanotrophic community activity and structure were investigated. Both high and low affinity methane oxidation rates were lower in the soil treated with mineral fertilizer compared to the other soils. An enhanced nitrate concentration was observed in the mineral <b>fertilized</b> <b>soil</b> but nitrate did not show a direct affect on the high affinity methane oxidation. In contrast, the low affinity methane oxidation was slowed down by increased nitrate concentrations, which suggests a direct effect of nitrate on low affinity methane oxidation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16 S rRNA gene fragments specific for methanotrophs revealed a distinct community between the mineral and organic <b>fertilized</b> <b>soils</b> as extra Type I methanotrophic bands (phylotypes) became visible in the organic <b>fertilized</b> <b>soils.</b> These phylotypes were not visible in the patterns of the added organic fertilizers suggesting an indirect effect of the organic fertilizers on the methanotrophic community.
