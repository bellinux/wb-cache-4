5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E
5|$|The east bay of {{the barn}} {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge and gate, directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the gatehouse by the insertion of metal <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates {{at the ends of}} these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof guttering and downpipes were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the gatehouse, and it was opened to the public in 1902.|$|E

With a modification of the weld design, the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> has withstood proof loading {{and there was no}} cracking after proof loading...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{because the}} ratio of the typical <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> length to its cross section is usually very large, it would buckle under the action of {{compressive}} forces. The working strength of a <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is the product of the allowable working stress and the rod's minimum cross-sectional area.|$|R

25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16-inch <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> instead of the 1/2-inch <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper control arms lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|E
25|$|The {{steel anchors}} holding the statues to the {{pedestals}} {{were also in}} poor shape. Some of the bitumen flaked off, exposing the bare steel to corrosion and permitting corrosion to occur under the coating. Many of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were close to structural collapse, and one had completely failed. The steel anchor frames were removed, and brass framing installed.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 the National Trust for Historic Preservation {{listed the}} hotel {{as one of}} America's most {{endangered}} places and the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana matched an anonymous $70,000 donation to pay for work to stabilize the main structure. <b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> were installed, the roof was patched, drainage was improved on roof parapets, and the structure around the partially collapsed wall was secured. HLFI also created promotional materials to help find a buyer and promoted {{the establishment of a}} local zoning and redevelopment commission.|$|E
5000|$|While in {{automotive}} parlance {{the term}} [...] "ball joint" [...] usually {{refers to the}} primary ball joint connections {{at the ends of}} the control arms, this type of joint is used in other parts as well, including <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends. In these other applications, they are typically called <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> ends or, when they are an inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> end on a rack-and-pinion steering system, they are called inner socket assemblies. These joints are also used {{in a number of other}} non-automotive applications, from the joints of dolls to other mechanical linkages for a variety of devices, or any place where a degree of rotation in movement is desired.|$|R

25|$|In the Byzantine period, domes were {{normally}} hemispherical and had, {{with occasional}} exceptions, windowed drums. All {{of the surviving}} examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding {{to the number of}} windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.|$|E
500|$|A [...] {{length of}} the {{original}} roof structure, comprising the two end bays at {{the south of the}} station, and part of the western wall collapsed at 3:57p.m. on 5 December 1905. A gang of men were employed at the time in repairing, glazing and painting the section of roof which fell. Shortly after 3:45p.m, the roof emitted a loud noise, which was when someone noticed that one of the main <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> had broken and was hanging down. Part of the roof began to sag and the western wall began to crack.|$|E
500|$|The sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the {{thickness}} of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult. Cloud Gate was originally estimated to weigh [...] when completed. However, the final figure was almost twice as heavy at [...] This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms {{the back side of the}} restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected. Cloud Gate is further buttressed by lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's interior structure by <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E

The classical preload design {{method of}} prestressed frame of hydraulic presses {{is based on}} the assumption that the beams of the frame are rigid, which is not agree with practice. In order to eliminate the unbalance load of the frame of a 100 MN hydraulic press due to improper prestressing, <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> preload distribution in prestressing of the frame is researched with respectively mechanics of materials and the finite element methods. According to mechanics of materials and finite element analysis results, reasonable <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> preloads and sequence of preloading are obtained and the unbalance load of the frame of the hydraulic press is solved. It also provides references for the preload design of prestressed frame of hydraulic presses...|$|R
500|$|In March 2015, {{additional}} {{details of the}} improvement package were published in Aviation Week & Space Technology. [...] The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800lb. [...] Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and composite integration panels, {{similar to those used}} on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless {{of the extent to which}} pilots command the elevators. [...] Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a"poor man's airfoil" [...] by Boeing; this originally developed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12 project. [...] Another change involves elevator trim bias. [...] These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} on opening day, 4 April 1904, the {{architect}} F.W.J. Palmer detailed the building's construction. To prevent subsidence on this steep clay slope, {{so close to the}} sea: [...] " [...] had to be removed, [...] by [...] pitch pine piles ranging from [...] to [...] long were driven at stated distances down into the clay, on the north, east and west sides of the site, and connected together by means of [...] wrought iron <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> passed through the piles, and interlaced one with the other, and connected together by means of [...] by [...] by [...] iron rings, through which the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were passed, and nuts placed in position, thus enabling the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> to be adjusted and tightened to a nicety. The whole of the site was then covered with a solid mass of Portland cement concrete [...] thick, which when finished left the ironwork completely embedded in the same. Upon this foundation the superstructure was erected." [...] From a speech by F.W.J. Palmer at the opening of The Pavilion, 4 April 1904 Under all walls there was a damp course of fibrous asphalt. [...] The outer walls were of red and hard stock bricks with dressings of Victoria stone and facing bricks of Whiting's best reds The roof was made of rolled steel joists covered with sheets of expanded steel lathing, supplied and fixed by the New Expanded Metal Company, and the lathing for the ceilings was of sheets of this expanded metal lathing but of a smaller gauge. [...] of coke breezed concrete was laid over these sheets, then [...] of Val de Travers Mastic Asphalt was laid on top in two [...] layers.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{progress}} of architecture depended on the mastery of metal, from its extraction to the cutting of the stone, especially {{in relation to the}} quality of the metal tools used in construction. [...] Metal was also used extensively by Gothic architects from the 12th century on, in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> across arches and later in the reinforced stone of the Rayonnant style. [...] The other building material, wood, was in short supply after the drastic deforestation of the 10th and 11th centuries. [...] The Cistercians acted with particular care in the careful management and conservation of their forests.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, the Phi Tau {{residence}} {{began to}} face serious structural problems after {{the removal of}} a porch {{on the south side}} of the building. [...] The walls of the building were constructed out of brick. [...] Presented with different loads and stresses, the north wall began to bulge outward by nearly half a meter, and was literally threatening to explode. [...] Large steel plates were placed on the outside of the building and steel <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> were threaded through the building between the ground and second floor to pull the plates together and force the exterior walls to straighten.

2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (<b>tie</b> <b>rods).</b> These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E

50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is Bell Crank Mechanism. The Bell crank lever rotates around the Fulcrum point. One {{end of the}} Bell crank lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the Bell crank lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the bell crank lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|R
