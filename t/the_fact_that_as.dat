5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{submitted}} {{his resignation}} as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone {{with both a}} solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young man}} destined {{to serve in the}} navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was {{stationed}} in Malta. There, he grew close to {{and fell in love with}} his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E

5|$|The Creature—an {{original}} script by Kneale {{concerning the}} legend of the abominable snowman—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955, followed by an adaptation of Peter Ustinov's play The Moment of Truth (10 March 1955), before Kneale was commissioned to write Quatermass II. Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new ITV network, which launched just a month before Quatermass II was shown, the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers. Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, as well <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the Official Secrets Act.|$|E

25|$|Jonidan (序二段) is {{the fifth}} highest division.

25|$|From certain {{expressions}} used in astrological {{texts that}} are {{earlier than the}} 7th century BC it would appear, indeed, that the beginnings at least of the calculation of sun and moon eclipses belong to the earlier period, but here, too, the chief work accomplished was after 400 BC, and the defectiveness of early Babylonian astronomy may be gathered from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> late as the 6th century BC an error of almost an entire month {{was made by the}} Babylonian astronomers in the attempt to determine through calculation the beginning of a certain year.|$|E

While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), {{the bottom line is that}} even in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E
25|$|Lawrence {{was awarded}} a benefit match by Somerset in 1954, and though the match itself was spoilt by rain, the benefit fund {{eventually}} reached £3,000. This was despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> a strict Methodist, Lawrence refused to allow any Sunday matches to be arranged for his benefit. He also forbade any raffles to be organised for his benefit. In the 1954 cricket season itself, Lawrence responded by making 929 runs and taking 93 wickets, nearer to the elusive double {{than in any other}} season apart from 1950. Moreover, the cost of the wickets fell significantly, to 20.66 runs per wicket. For the third consecutive year, he was Somerset's leading wicket-taker.|$|E

25|$|From {{an early}} stage in 1984, before the {{official}} announcement of the councils to be rate-capped, Basildon had worked {{on the assumption that}} it would have its budget restricted. In March, prior to the capping list being announced, the council leadership invited the Audit Commission to independently investigate its spending, hoping that it would vindicate the council's decisions. The report found that the council's high spending was not the result of inefficiency but of policy decisions, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a new town it had higher interest payments and higher spending on managing housing. The council duly published the report after it was capped, making much {{of the fact that the}} Audit Commission had exonerated it.|$|E
25|$|The phase {{ambiguity}} reflects <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> Witten has shown, {{the quantum}} correlation functions {{are not fully}} defined by the classical data. The linking number of a loop with itself enters into the calculation of the partition function, but this number is not invariant under small deformations and in particular, is not a topological invariant. This number can be rendered well defined if one chooses a framing for each loop, which is a choice of preferred nonzero normal vector at each point along which one deforms the loop to calculate its self-linking number. This procedure {{is an example of}} the point-splitting regularization procedure introduced by Paul Dirac and Rudolf Peierls to define apparently divergent quantities in quantum field theory in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Under Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum {{qualifications}} {{of age and}} priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 {{years of age and}} 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in view of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.|$|E

25|$|Churchill was wary of Adolf Hitler's {{potential}} danger {{as early as}} 1930. More than two years before Hitler took power in January 1933, Churchill warned at a dinner at the German Embassy that Hitler and his followers would start a war as soon as possible. Beginning in 1932, when he opposed those who advocated giving Germany the right to military parity with France, Churchill spoke often {{of the dangers of}} German rearmament. Later, particularly in The Gathering Storm, he tried to portray himself as being for a time, a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen itself against Germany. However Lord Lloyd was the first to so agitate. Churchill also tried to portray himself as warning against German rearmament as early as 1930 and as opposing what he saw as British disarmament at and before that time. He omits <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Chancellor of the Exchequer he had imposed the heavy defence cuts referred to above.|$|E
25|$|During the Wars of the Roses, Hastings was a {{committed}} {{supporter of the}} House of York. Shortly before 1 June 1470, he married Joan Welles, who was heir to her brother, Robert Welles, 8th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Her inheritance was complicated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of an}} anti-Yorkist uprising in Lincolnshire, Joan Welles' father, Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles, and her brother, Sir Robert, had been beheaded by order of Edward IV within a week of each other, her father on 12 March 1470, and her brother on 19 March. A month later, on 25 April 1470, the King seized Sir Robert Welles' lands, but on 1 June 1470, granted them to Joan and her now husband, Sir Richard Hastings, giving them licence to enter all the lands 'which on the death of her father and brother, both tenants-in-chief, should descend to her'. According to modern doctrine, Joan also inherited the baronies of Willoughby and Welles after her brother's execution.|$|E
