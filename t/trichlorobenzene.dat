40|$|A {{bacterial}} {{mixed culture}} reductively dechlorinating <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> {{was established in}} a defined, synthetic mineral medium without any complex additions and with pyruvate as the carbon and energy source. The culture was maintained over 39 consecutive transfers of small inocula into fresh media, enriching the dechlorinating activity. In situ probing with fluorescence-labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes revealed that two major subpopulations within the microbial consortium were phylogenetically affiliated with a sublineage within the Desulfovibrionaceae and the gamma subclass of Proteobacteria. The bacterial consortium grew by fermentation of pyruvate, forming acetate, propionate, CO 2, formate, and hydrogen. Acetate and propionate supported neither the reduction of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> nor the reduction of sulfate when sulfate was present. Hydrogen and formate were used for sulfate reduction to sulfide. Sulfate strongly inhibited the reductive dechlorination of <b>trichlorobenzenes.</b> However, when sulfate was depleted in the medium due to sulfate reduction, dechlorination of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> started. Similar results were obtained when sulfite was present in the cultures. Molybdate at a concentration of 1 mM strongly inhibited the dechlorination of <b>trichlorobenzenes.</b> Cultures supplied with molybdate plus sulfate did not reduce sulfate, but dechlorination of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> occurred.

40|$|<b>Trichlorobenzenes</b> (TCBs) were intensively used in {{the last}} decades as {{essential}} components of dielectric fluids, intermediates in chemical synthesis, solvents, coolants, lubricants, heat-transfer medium; insecticide, additive in polyester dyeing and components of termite-control preparations (1, 2). Due to their widespread occurrence in the various environmental compartments they have been classified by OSPARCOM (Oslo and Paris Commissions) (3) as chemicals for priority action and have been proposed by the Marine Chemistry Working Group (MCWG) as chemical parameters in the Water Framework Directive (4). Based on their octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K ow = 4. 02 - 4. 49) (5) and bioconcentration factors in fish (ranging from 182 to 3200, depending on the lipid content) (6), these chemicals are expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. Against their potential significance in the marine environment there is relatively little information available concerning the actual concentration levels and distribution of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> in marine organisms (7, 8). The aim of this work was to develop an analytical method appropriate for the determination of TCBs in marine biota. The analytical method consists of saponification of the fish tissue with methanolic potassium hydroxide, liquid-liquid extraction of the solution with pentane, clean up of the concentrated extract on alumina column {{and analysis of the}} extract with gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector (ECD). The method proved to be appropriate for the detection of concentration levels typical of the organic contaminants in biota (7) (~ 1 ng /g wet weight of tissue).

The partial dechlorination using organic mediators was successful and good control of the reaction (i. e., monodechlorination) and good efficiency could be achieved. Some mediators showed poor current efficiencies due to the lower stability of their anion radical in the presence of protons. The monodechlorination of <b>trichlorobenzene</b> with four different mediators showed that the product distribution in terms of initial chlorine removed was little affected by the mediator used.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} an unusual chemical reaction {{that takes place}} on a graphene composite in a concerted fashion. The reaction shows the conversion of a persistent organochlorine pesticide, lindane (C 6 H 6 Cl 6), present in water, to different isomers of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> (TCBs, C 6 H 3 Cl 3) {{on the surface of}} reduced graphene oxide−silver composites (RGO@Ag). The reaction is unique to the composite and does not occur on RGO and nanoparticles of Ag separately. The products of the reaction were isolated and extensively characterized using analytical techniques such as gas chromatography−mass spectrometry, electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry, infrared and NMR, which unequivocally confirmed their identity. The as-formed TCBs were removed from the aqueous medium by adsorption on the same composite. Adsorption of lindane is physical in nature, but that of TCBs is through π−π interactions. The study reveals the unusual chemical reactivity of graphene−metal composites and their potential for water treatment. The uniqueness of the reaction on RGO@Ag is due to the simultaneous removal of three HCl molecules, leading to the formation of aromatic compounds and concomitant formation of silver chloride.

For all HOCs investigated, nonlinear isotherms were obtained. Based on logKoc, it can be concluded that the Danube sediment has a higher sorption affinity for PAHs than TCBs. A positive correlation between HOC molecular hydrophobicity and sorption affinity was obtained, meaning that hydrophobic interactions play a significant role. There was a negative correlation between molecular hydrophobicity and the percentage of eluted HOCs, indicating that more hydrophobic molecules show less mobility in the sediment column. In the presence of CNTs in the sediment column, HOC concentrations in the column eluate decreased by factors of 2 – 3. Metal oxides and hydroxides on the surface of the sediment under the given experimental conditions had positively charged centres that caused the deposition of CNTs, leading to simultaneous sorption of organic compounds on both sediment organic matter (SOM) and CNTs.

This process includes use of zerovalent granular iron or nanoparticles of iron for catalytic reductive dehalogenation of various organochlorine pesticides (Zhang 2003; Schrick et al. 2004). Paknikar et al. (2005) used an integrated nano-biotechnological approach for treatment of drinking water for elimination of pesticide residues. They synthesized FeS nanoparticles by wet chemical method and stabilized by fungal polymer. These FeS-nanoparticles carried out the dechlorination of lindane and the product was further mineralized by a bacterial culture which also degraded the fungal polymer. Similarly, electrochemical reduction of tricholoroethane using palladised iron oxide (Roh et al. 2001), reduction of carbontetrachloride by Fe 2 +, S 2 − and FeS (Assaf-Anid and Kun-Yu 2002), use of bimetallic particles for ground water treatment (Elliott and Zhang 2001), and dechlorination of lindane in multiphase catalytic reduction system with Pd/C, Pt/C and Renay/Ni have been reported as effective systems for treatment of ground water to make it free from pesticide residues (Zinovyev et al. 2004). More recently, integrated nano biotechnique was used by Singh et al. (2013) for γ-HCH degradation from contaminated soil in India. The stabilized Pd/Fe(0) bimetallic nanoparticles (CMC-Pd/Fe(0)) used Sphingomonas sp. strain NM 05 for degradation of γ-HCH. Their study signifies the potential efficacy of integrated technique as an effective alternative remedial tool for γ-HCH-contaminated soil. Although the biotechnological system used for biodegradation of organochlorine (OC) pesticides are promising and effective technique, it has some limitations. For example, the precipitation of metal hydroxides on iron decrease the reactivity but this leads to increase in toxicity of the released products (Zhao 2008). Salam and Das (2015) observed the degradation of lindane by a novel bio-nano system using nanoscale zinc oxide (n-ZnO). Homolková et al. (2015) reported ferrates as an ideal chemical reagent for treatment of water contaminated with HCH. This is due to their strong oxidation potential and the absence of harmful by products. The degradation of HCH studied with ferrates under laboratory conditions and reported the formation of <b>trichlorobenzenes</b> and pentachlorocyclohexenes as HCH degradation products. Wu et al. (2016) used palladium nanoparticles stabilized in microcellular high-density polyethylene for lindane and hexachlorobenzenee (HCB) degradation. Yang et al. (2017) reported the nonreductive dechlorination of lindane by nitrogen containing multiwall carbon nanotubes N-MWCNTs (CNT-N 1 and CNTN 2) with pH (7.0 – 9.0) and observed the amine and pyridinic nitrogen species as basic sites responsible for the dehydrochlorination of lindane under environment conditions. They concluded that the enhanced degradation might be due to that amine and pyridinic nitrogen species. This could attack the hydrogen atom attached to the β–carbon and the dehydrochlorination of lindane followed a β-elimination mechanism. Usman et al. (2017) reported chemical oxidation of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in contaminated soil under water saturated and unsaturated conditions by applying the following treatments at neutral pH: H 2 O 2 alone, H 2 O 2 /FeII, Na 2 S 2 O 8 alone, Na 2 S 2 O 8 /FeII, and KMnO 4. They observed that more than 60 % of the pollutant was lost after chemical oxidation, thereby, minimizing the non-selective behavior of chemical oxidation in soil.|$|R
