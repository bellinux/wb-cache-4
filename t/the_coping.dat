5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. <b>The</b> <b>coping</b> mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack <b>the</b> <b>coping</b> skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

40|$|Coping of beams {{is usually}} done {{in order to}} allow for {{clearance}} at connections, but doing so reduces the beams strength and makes it susceptible to local web buckling at <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> section. Due to this reduction of the beam's strength, it was of interest to reinforce the web at <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> end. Previous researchers have proposed several design recommendations for reinforcement of coped beams. Possible measures involves welding on endplates or use of bolted connections at <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> end, and provision of stiffeners at <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> region. In this thesis a numerical study on <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> beam's strength and behaviour is presented. Nonlinear finite element analyses have been conducted to predict the structural behaviour and capacities of coped beams with varying <b>cope</b> dimensions. <b>The</b> beam was strengthened by either restraining <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> end from lateral translation or by provision of stiffeners at <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> region. <b>The</b> effect of restraining <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> end depended on <b>the</b> <b>cope</b> dimensions. For cope length-to-reduced beam hight ratios lesser than 1 (c/h_ 0 = 1), the effect was negligible. Reinforcement in longitudinal direction only did not prevent the occurence of local web buckling, so that the recommended reinforcement details of <b>the</b> <b>coped</b> beam included a combination of stiffeners in both vertical and longitudinal direction for which the beam was able to develop the plastic moment capacity of the full beam section without any significant sideways rigid body movement of the longitudinal stiffeners. The proposed design recommendations considers the webs slenderness and coped dimensions. For coped beams with web depth-to-thickness ratios (h_w/t_w) {{less than or equal to}} 58 and cope length-to-reduced web hight ratios (c/h_ 0) less than one, longitudinal and vertical stiffeners were required while double vertical stiffeners were required for cope ratios equal to or more than 1. For coped beams with web depth-to-thickness ratio more than 58 and less than or equal to 67 and cope ratios less than or equal to 0. 5 vertical and longitudinal stiffeners were required, while double vertical stiffeners were required for cope ratios of more than 0. 5. </p...|$|R

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in <b>the</b> <b>coping</b> process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

The animal's fearsome reputation in India is reflected {{by the number of}} pejorative names it possesses in Hindi, which variously translate as [...] "red devil", [...] "devil dog", [...] "jungle devil", or [...] "hound of Kali". According to zoologist and explorer Leopold von Schrenck, he had trouble obtaining dhole specimens during his exploration of Amurland, as the local Gilyaks greatly feared the species. This fear and superstition was not however shared by neighbouring Tungusic peoples. Von Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Dhole-like animals are described in numerous old European texts, including the Ostrogoth sagas, where they are portrayed as hell hounds. The demon dogs accompanying Hellequin in Mediaeval French passion plays, as well as the ones inhabiting the legendary forest of Brocéliande, have been attributed to dholes. According to Charles Hamilton Smith, the dangerous wild canids mentioned by Scaliger as having lived in the forests of Montefalcone could have been based on dholes, as they were described as unlike wolves in habits, voice and appearance. The Montefalcone family's coat of arms had a pair of red dogs as supporters.|$|E
