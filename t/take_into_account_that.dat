25|$|In the U.S. of the 1930s, one farmer fed only {{himself and}} three other consumers. The same farmer now feeds well over a hundred people. However, some authors {{consider}} this estimate to be flawed, as it does not <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> farming requires energy and many other resources which have to be provided by additional workers, so that the ratio of people fed to farmers is actually smaller than 100 to 1.|$|E
25|$|Decompression {{procedures}} may <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> {{the cave}} diver usually follows a very rigidly constrained and precisely defined route, both {{into and out}} of the cave, and can reasonably expect to find any equipment such as drop cylinders temporarily stored along the guideline while making the exit. In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.|$|E
25|$|The reason: {{under the}} {{original}} flight plan, when Huygens was to descend to Titan, {{it would have}} accelerated relative to Cassini, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary. Consequently, the hardware of Cassinis receiver {{was designed to be}} able to receive over a range of shifted frequencies. However, the firmware failed to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by phase-shift keying at 8192 bits per second.|$|E

25|$|To {{evaluate}} the vague and even contradictory {{form in which}} Bernal treats the matter of kidnapping Indians as a possible objective of the voyage, one must <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> he wrote his history of the conquest some fifty years after the occurrence of these events, and that {{at least in part}} his objective was to have his services and those of his fellow soldiers recognized by the Crown. It would have been difficult in these circumstances for him to have clearly stated that this had originally been a slaving expedition.|$|E
25|$|The {{tube length}} determines whether the tube {{acoustic}} pressure or velocity {{is the dominant}} influence on {{the frequency of the}} tube. Simple models of organ pipe resonance is based on open-open pipe resonance (λ=) but corrections must be made to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> one end of the pipe radiates into the surrounding medium and the other radiates through a slit with a jet flow. Boelkes and Hoffmann have made measurements of end correction for open-open tubes and derived the relation δ=0.33D. This cannot be exact since the driving end is not open.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{production}} of the Prouty novel had to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> European locales {{would not be possible}} in the midst of World War II, despite the novelist's insistence on using Italy as the main setting. Prouty's quirky demands for vibrant colors and flashbacks shot in black and white with subtitles were similarly disregarded. Principal photography was shifted to Warner's sound stage 18 and various locations around California, including the San Bernardino National Forest, while European scenes were replaced by stock footage of Brazil. One of the primary reasons for Davis being interested in the original project was that photography would also take place in her hometown of Boston.|$|E
25|$|When {{measurable}} quantities involve cross products, the handedness of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, {{it should be}} possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> when the handedness of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{stagnation}} {{brought about the}} crisis of the Soviet system and reforms could not be long delayed. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms failed to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the USSR was held together by military force by repressing all forms of nationalism. The freedoms of Glasnost released long suppressed feelings of nationalism in the Baltic republics, in a development known as the Singing Revolution. The first major demonstrations against the system were in Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals {{and by the end of}} 1988 the reform wing had gained a decisive position in the Baltic republics.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recorded}} climb {{of the mountain}} was made on 7–8 June 1956 by Giorgos Michailidis and Giorgos Xanthopoulos who climbed the face of Gamila. Four years later, on 25–26 August 1960, Guido Magnone and Spyros Antypas climbed the northeastern face of Gamila. Currently there are 17 climbing fields on the mountain, covering {{most of the major}} peaks and other geological features of the mountain. From the aforementioned fields, the northeastern face of Gamila counts 8 climbing routes, and Gamila II 6. The fields of Astraka and Tsouka Rossa have several climbing routes each. The former counts 30 routes in both its northwestern and northeastern faces, and the latter 19 routes. Potential climbers should <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> several of the routes were first ascended several years ago and thus pitons might be compromised if present at all. Furthermore, some locations in the mountain are isolated and rescue services might find it particularly challenging to access the area in case of emergency.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein and the methods chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the protein core and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited to the other end. On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will help you to choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E
25|$|Principles of {{set theory}} {{appeared}} in an already tense {{time on the}} eve of the First World War. In August 1914, the war, which also dramatically affected the scientific life in Europe. Under these circumstances, could hardly be effective Hausdorff's book in the first five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the suggestions that were included in this work in such abundance, and with no doubt, the topology was the focus of attention. The journal Fundamenta Mathematicae played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff ideas, founded in Poland in 1920. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic and foundations of mathematics. In this spectrum, a special focus was the general topology. Hausdorff's Principles were present in Fundamenta Mathematicae from the first volume in a remarkable frequency. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff's own three works not calculated), which appeared in the first twenty volumes from 1920 to 1933, 88 cite Principles. One even has to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> as Hausdorff's conceptions increasingly became commonplace, so they were also used in a number of works that did not mention it explicitly.|$|E

500|$|According to a 2007 blue-ribbon panel, {{the cost}} overruns of the Big Dig, {{combined}} with Baker's plan for financing them, ultimately left the state transportation system underfunded by $1 billion a year. Baker defended his plan as responsible, effective, {{and based on}} previous government officials' good-faith assurances that the Big Dig would be built on time and on budget. However, as he was developing the plan, Baker had also had to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> Governor Cellucci was dead-set against any new taxes or fees. Former State Transportation Secretary James J.

500|$|The {{brain of}} Edmontosaurus has been {{described}} in several papers and abstracts {{through the use of}} endocasts of the cavity where the brain had been.

Like Stegosaurus, the neural canal was expanded in the hips, but not to the same degree: the endosacral space of Stegosaurus had 20times the volume of its endocranial cast, whereas the endosacral space of Edmontosaurus was only 2.59times larger in volume.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{the effects}} of the Hoover Dike were seen. An {{extended}} drought occurred in the 1930s; with the wall preventing water from leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust. Salt ocean water intruded into Miami's wells; when the city brought in an expert to explain why, he discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's groundwater—here, it appeared on the surface. In 1939, a million acres (4,000km²) of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Scientists who took soil samples before draining did not <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades make it prone to soil subsidence when it becomes dry. Naturally occurring bacteria in Everglades peat and muck assist with the process of decomposition under water, which is generally very slow, partially due to the low levels of dissolved oxygen. When water levels became so low that peat and muck were at the surface, the bacteria interacted with much higher levels of oxygen in the air, rapidly breaking down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved to stilts and [...] of soil was lost.|$|E
