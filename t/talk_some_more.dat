Only Daniela is awake and she has illuminated the place with the light of cellphones {{left behind by the}} passengers when they ditched the train. She tells Four that the duffel bag actually belonged to bank robbers who had robbed the bank she was hiding in, when they fled and she thought the bag would be useful. She and Four <b>talk</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> about the whole saving-the-world-from-Mogadorians thing and she describes to him the video posted by Sarah and Mark. Sam wakes and they are about to leave for the civilian evac point at Brooklyn bridge when human soldiers find them in the subway car. They take the three to the Bridge anyway to meet Agent Walker, an ex-MogPro agent from a previous book. Daniela leaves the duffel bag behind in case they arrest her. Four meets with Agent Walker who has been designated as the middleman for the cautious government's communication with the Garde. She tells him of the dire invasion situation {{all over the world and}} also tells him about Setrákus Ra's threat to the government to surrender all the Garde and humans-turned-Garde to the Mogs in 48 hours. Walker tells Four that the government might actually consider the bargain.|$|E
5000|$|Allen {{works with}} his friend and flatmate Bud Clark (Preston Foster), as a riveter, {{high up on the}} girders of a {{skyscraper}} under construction, getting paid $62.50 a week, [...] "more than a college professor". Bud is engaged to be married, and tries to set up a date for Allen that night, but Allen expresses some disinterest, as Bud keeps setting John Allen up with [...] "firewagons", his term for fat girls. Bud and John go out on the town after Bud winning $38 on the horses. John sees that the girl that Bud has brought along for him to double date is another [...] "firewagon" [...] (June Gittelson), so he splits off on his own, going to a Taxi dance hall nearby, where he meets dancer Shirley Day (Vivienne Osborne). After dancing and talking to Shirley for some time, he indicates that they should <b>talk</b> <b>some</b> <b>more.</b> [...] "Can't. Gotta have a ticket". [...] "Well OK", Allen dozily says. [...] "Get a handful so we can dance a lot together". In the five minutes Allen is away buying tickets, Shirley has gone off with another customer. That customer gropes her, and Shirley Day causes a scene, shouting at the customer. [...] "He paid a dime and he thinks that entitles him to privileges". John Allen Wades in, punching the customer to the floor. Tony, the dance hall owner (J. Carrol Naish), tells them both to get out, firing Shirley Day. Allen then takes Shirley for a milk shake.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was able}} to return home on leave {{at the end of}} January 1916, but was soon [...] "back in my little wooden hut'" [...] again. He {{continued}} to spend his time ministering {{to the needs of the}} injured soldiers and helping them write letters home. He also assisted the surgeon in operations in the field hospital; in a letter to his daughter Joan in February he relates an anecdote about his work in the hospital: Our best surgeon is a very nice Irishman and he always takes the worst cases and I sort of work with him. The men have generally had morphia given to them, but they do not often give an anaesthetic in a Field Ambulance, so it is very often very painful for the poor chaps having their wounds dressed and attended to. A man often suffers a lot anticipating he is going to be hurt, and by talking to him and interesting him you can often take his mind off — about all sorts of things, cricket, football, boxing — Captain Moore always helps along and joins in. The other day we had a Welshman who had some very painful wounds. As a rule Welshmen do not stand pain very well, but this man was very keen on football, so he and I and Moore carried on a violent discussion about football and the man got through it splendidly, and I went off to another man. Then Moore found he had something more to do to the Welshman, so he came over and said [...] "Come along - my local anaesthetic - I want you to <b>talk</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> football." ...|$|E

During the new patient history, Dr. Wilson asks, “Are you sexually active now, or {{do you plan to}} be?” Jennifer hesitates to answer. Instead, she tells Dr. Wilson that the visit will be charged to her parents ’ insurance and asks whether what she says will be confidential. Dr. Wilson replies, “Conversations that teens have with their physicians about matters of sexuality and drug use are kept confidential. We want you to be able to discuss things that are of concern to you and your health without fearing that we will ‘tell on you ’ to you parents or anyone else. ” “Whew, ” Jennifer says. She then tells Dr. Wilson that she recently entered a pact with her friends. Each girl promised the others she would get pregnant within the next year. “And I want you to be my doctor, ” she concludes. “My goodness, Jennifer. That is quite a serious pact. We must <b>talk</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> about this. We must think about how having a child will influence the rest of your life, and how profound and difficult the consequences of this decision can be, especially at your age. How many of your friends are in this pact?” Jennifer responds, “Four of them. Our families will help us take care of the kids. We all know that. We just want to go through this together, before we separate and go to college or something. ...|$|E
40|$|T hose {{who teach}} {{know that our}} {{understanding}} of a topic gains depth and clarity-becomes truly understanding rather than a pale collection of facts and half-remembered thoughts-only within a dynamic environment where we try to set out concepts for others and have them challenge and question us. For this, beyond the contractual obligations of a profession, is what teaching is all about: to teach is to learn, and to share that learning with others. It is odd, then, that the organization of our classrooms does not permit stu-dents to experience this same dynamic process. Typically, we talk, the students listen, a few ask questions, we <b>talk</b> <b>some</b> <b>more,</b> play a few example$, and then it's {{on to the next}} class. We assume that students will master and retain the material by taking notes, asking a question now and then, and studying on their own. But given our own experience this assumption seems dubious at best. An alternative is to change the dynamic of the classroom by di-viding a class up into small groups of typically four students and asking them to work on specific topics as a group. Students then have an opportunity to become teachers themselves as they explain problems and concepts to other students, discuss alternative solu-tions, and work together to develop an understanding of the topic. This, in essence, is cooperative learning at its best. The opportunity provided by placing students in small groups may also be lost: stu-dents may fail to participate actively in their groups, groups may employ ineffective strategies in their approach to tasks, tasks may be inap,propriate for group work.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were: (1) {{to find out the}} target and learning needs of spa therapists in Yogyakarta in learning English speaking skills, and (2) to develop the appropriate English speaking learning materials for spa therapists in Yogyakarta. This research was a Research and Development (R & D) study. The procedure of this research followed Dick and Carey model in Gall and Borg (2003) with some modifications. The steps of the research procedure were: (1) conducting needs analysis, (2) planning (writing the course grid), (3) writing the first draft of the materials, (4) conducting materials evaluation, and (5) writing the final draft of the materials. This research involved 40 spa therapists in Yogyakarta as the subject of the research. The data collection instruments used in this research were needs analysis questionnaire and materials evaluation questionnaire. The data from the needs analysis were analyzed quantitatively using frequency and percentage and the data obtained from the materials evaluation were analyzed through descriptive statistics. The findings showed that: (1) the spa therapists learn English mainly to improve their speaking skills; (2) they needed to master language functions that are useful for them in doing their job; (3) they considered themselves as beginner speakers lacking in speaking, vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation; (4) they wanted English learning materials that can help them to improve their speaking skills, pronunciation, grammar use, vocabulary, and language functions related to their job; (5) they wanted the materials to provide topics related to their job and to have clear instructions, explanations, examples, pronunciation transcripts, colorful illustrations, tips, exercises, glossary, self-check, and summary; (6) the needed inputs for the materials are dialogues, vocabulary, and languages functions; (7) the materials should cover varied activities of listening, speaking, vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation; (8) the materials should facilitate them to work individually and in pairs; and (9) they were expecting to have teachers who correct every mistake they make and to involve in discussions while doing the tasks. Furthermore, after writing the course grid, the materials were then developed to have three units. Each unit has different number of tasks, but has the same unit design whose components are: (1) introduction (Unit Title, Learning Objectives), (2) main lesson (Getting Started, Start Talking, Listen to This, Say It Right, Focus on Grammar, <b>Talk</b> <b>Some</b> <b>More,</b> Work in Pairs), (3) reinforcement (Self-Check, Summary), and (4) fun part (Fun Corner). The materials were then being evaluated by experts in terms of content, language, presentation, and layout appropriateness. The results of the materials evaluation showed that the materials fell into the “very good” category as the mean value of all aspects of the developed materials is 3. 44 which is in range of “very good” category that is 3. 25 ≤ x ≤ 4...|$|E

Martin said 'Jackie, this is not 1967 and you are not The Beatles'.

5000|$|When Sam {{introduced}} Hecht to Lancaster in his {{dressing room}} on {{the last night of}} the play, Hecht opted for honesty. He told Lancaster [...] "I know everybody, but I have few clients. If you sign with me, you'd be important to me. I'd work harder for you because I want to eat and I'd have to keep you working". Contrary to popular quotes from the parties, Lancaster signed with Hecht before the mention of producing their own films was even mentioned. Lancaster immediately signed with Hecht in his dressing room and they went out to celebrate at a restaurant. It was once at this restaurant that they <b>talked</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> about the film industry and Hecht said [...] "You know, I don't like being an agent. I want to produce pictures". Lancaster replied that he too wanted to produce films, which led to Hecht's retort [...] "Maybe in five years we can make it".|$|R
