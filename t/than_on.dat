5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty <b>than</b> <b>on</b> previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E

5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{returned}} {{to the mouth of}} the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship. Working in much greater comfort <b>than</b> <b>on</b> his last visit to the area in 1848, with other members of his staff he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport. Later that month he did the same for Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E

40|$|AbstractParents (n= 610) and {{teachers}} (n= 228) of 292 girls and 318 boys answered the Social Skills Rating System-Parent and Teacher forms (Gresham & Elliot, 1990) which aimed at investigating gender differences on social skills, problem behaviors and academic competences of Iranian kindergarten children. Results showed that girls scored higher <b>than</b> boys <b>on</b> social skills. Conversely, {{teachers and parents}} scored boys higher <b>than</b> girls <b>on</b> the externalizing and hyperactivity problem behaviors with no gender differences on internalizing. Also, girls scored higher <b>than</b> boys <b>on</b> academic competences...|$|R

5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical {{version of the}} story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel <b>than</b> <b>on</b> the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{dominated}} {{the next two}} years, with the 1912 and 1913 teams losing only one game each. Warner's salary increased to $4,500 (approximately $107,000 in 2016) per season. In 1914 there was an administrative change in Washington, with federal money considered better spent in the Midwest <b>than</b> <b>on</b> schools like Carlisle. Many students left, and this affected the team (which had a 5–10–1 record). After that season, Warner left Carlisle to become head coach at Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on the ground, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E
50|$|Power output on the Class 311000 trains {{is greater}} <b>than</b> that <b>on</b> the Class 1000 trains.

30|$|Local sweat {{sensation}} {{showed more}} distinct difference between values in exercise and recovery than regional thermal sensation (Figure  3). In FullPPE, local sweat sensation around {{the head and}} hands tended to be greater <b>than</b> those <b>on</b> other regions. In NoGloves, sweat sensation on the hands tended to be lower <b>than</b> those <b>on</b> other body regions, and sweat sensation around the feet in NoBoots tended to be lower <b>than</b> those <b>on</b> other regions, while for the NoHelmet condition, head sweat sensation did not reflect any benefit of the head exposure.|$|R

5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher <b>than</b> <b>on</b> DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms <b>than</b> <b>on</b> DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{continued}} {{to maintain the}} diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia originally established by her deceased brother. She often wrote to Ivan IV ("Ivan the Terrible"), on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> {{the possibility of a}} military alliance. The Tsar even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised.|$|E
5|$|Fewer deck {{officers}} are employed on bulkers <b>than</b> <b>on</b> similarly sized ships of other types. A mini-bulker carries {{two to three}} deck officers, while larger Handysize and Capesize bulkers carry four.

5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|His feast day was {{included}} in the General Roman Calendar in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> his date of death, 26 May, which was then the feast day of Pope Saint Gregory VII. He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May, and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with a feast day on 27 May.|$|E

5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell has {{presented}} four {{series of the}} online video show David Mitchell's Soapbox, a series of short monologues co-written with John Finnemore for ChannelFlip.
