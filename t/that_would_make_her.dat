5|$|Lynette grows {{increasingly}} weary at {{the idea}} of having more children. She confesses to Tom that while she began loving her other children before they were born, she does not have the same feelings for her unborn twins. Tom assures her that she will love them once she is able to hold them in her arms. At Lynette's request, the couple conceals the pregnancy from their family and friends. Meanwhile, Gabrielle is irritated with Ana's poor attitude, provocative wardrobe, and disregard for her curfew or other rules. Carlos insists that Gabrielle sign a contract <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> Ana's legal guardian, but she refuses. However, when Ana expresses interest in becoming a model, Gabrielle understands that they are more alike than she initially thought and signs the guardianship documents.|$|E

Just as {{she is about to}} say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to read it again.|$|E

25|$|Mary Hanford Ford's {{earliest}} days are framed in two basic sets of facts. First, {{of her birth}} family, she was born on November 1, 1856, possibly to a mercantile/banker family in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The family was noted a year later in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The Kansas City Star obituary noted she had a brother, A.M. Finney, known from Charleston, West Virginia. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> father Asahel Clark Finney who spent the last working decade of {{his life as a}} partner in a Pennsylvania lumber company. Ford's mother may have been Mary Hanford Edson. Ford was said to have attended a private school or seminary and studied art and languages in Burlington, Vermont. It is not clear how or when Mary moved to the Kansas area ahead of her father in 1882. Secondly, of her married life, Ford was the second wife of Smith Moses Ford, marrying about October 8, 1878, when she was known as Minnie Finnie and was living in Winfield, Kansas. S.M. Ford was a former alderman, teacher, newspaper writer and eventually newspaper publisher. Their first child, Roland Ford, was born circa 1879.|$|E
500|$|Connecticut steamed back to Hampton Roads after this, {{arriving}} on 16 April; when she arrived, Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, {{commander of the}} Atlantic Fleet, transferred his flag from [...] to Connecticut, making her the flagship of the fleet. President Theodore Roosevelt opened the Jamestown Exposition on 25 April, and Connecticut was named as the official host of the vessels that were visiting from other countries. Sailors and marines from the ship took part in various events ashore, and foreign dignitaries, along with the governors of Virginia and Rhode Island, were hosted aboard the ship on 29 April. Evans closed the Exposition on 4 May on the quarterdeck of Connecticut. On 10 June, Connecticut joined in the Presidential Fleet Review; she left three days later for an overhaul in the New York Naval Yard. After the overhaul, Connecticut conducted maneuvers off Hampton Roads and target practice off Cape Cod. She was ordered back to the New York Naval Yard once again on 6 September for a refit <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> suitable for use as flagship of the Great White Fleet.|$|E
500|$|Every {{night on}} the tour to support their 2000 album Return of Saturn, No Doubt threw {{after-show}} parties where people danced to Jamaican dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of [...] "Hey Baby" [...] emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> depressed [...] "or find different words that inspire me." [...] In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions {{were used in the}} final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the [...] "initial spark" [...] from when the songs were conceived.|$|E

500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly opined that the chemistry {{between the two}} actors was [...] "fresh and irresistible." [...] Zorianna Kit of The Huffington Post exclaimed that [...] "what [...] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." [...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Textile {{production}} including batik {{has been}} {{important in the}} northwestern desert regions of South Australia, in the Northern Territory's Utopia community, and {{in other areas of}} central Australia. For a decade before commencing the painting career <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> famous, Emily Kngwarreye was creating batik designs that revealed her [...] "prodigious original talent" [...] and the modernity of her artistic vision. A wide range of textile art techniques, including dyeing and weaving, is particularly associated with Pukatja, South Australia (formerly known as Ernabella), but in the mid-2000s the community also developed a reputation for fine sgraffito ceramics. Hermannsburg, originally home to Albert Namatjira and the Arrente Watercolourists, is now renowned for its pottery.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{reportedly}} tumultuous goings-on, involving promiscuity by both partners and {{frequent use of}} drugs. On one occasion, Tobler failed to appear at the house and Giger, terrified, started frantically looking for her on highways. Eventually, he {{received a phone call}} from Tobler, three days later, who informed him that she had to make a trip of extreme urgency (probably with another boyfriend of hers, as remarked by Giger years later). According to the painter, [...] "as of that moment she did, more or less, what she wanted". Giger, who was always madly in love with her, was unable to help in her personal agonies and lack of control in her life, given his own psychological problems and agony over his artwork. Giger later stated that he was cheered simply by the fact that Li had found another lover, as <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> happy and also improve Giger and Li's life together. It has been acknowledged, however, that Giger also used to see other women, much as Li Tobler had parallel affairs during those years.|$|E

At about 6:15a.m. on October 8, 2004, she reported to FPC Alderson. Stewart said that her prison nickname was [...] "M. Diddy". While in confinement, she took a job and became an informal liaison between the administration and her fellow inmates. The People special, Scandals! That Rocked America, stated [...] "Some expected America's goddess of domestic perfection to fall into terminal despair. Instead, with the drive <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> a billionaire, Stewart took her lemon of a sentence and made lemonade. Heck, she made a lemon soufflé." [...] Stewart was released from FPC Alderson at 12:30a.m. on March 4, 2005. She was then placed in a two-year term of supervised release; during five of those months, she was placed in home confinement with electronic monitoring.

[...] Clover Hope of Vibe magazine commented: [...] "Fun, rhythmic, buoyant—it's the type of rebound we'd hoped for with 2008's Discipline, where Jackson teamed up with Rodney Jerkins {{in search of a}} youthful edge that only seemed to date her. They got it right here though, as Jerkins taps into Janet's sense of fanciful pleasure, rewinding time in a Janet way." [...] Jerkins also had Larry Ryckman and Ari Blitz Master [...] "Make Me" [...] with AfterMaster HD Audio which gave it a uniquely powerful presence. Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine hailed the song as her best dance recording since [...] "All for You" [...] (2001). Noting the single's similarity to Michael Jackson's disco themed [...] "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" [...] from Off the Wall, Menachem comments [...] " [...] isn't just Jackson's best dance song in years—it's a hit <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> brother proud."
