5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship}} of the principality and the Byzantine Empire; therefore, she offered Constance's hand to Manuel, a son of the Byzantine Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent the Byzantine marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge {{him to come to}} Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1945, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> encirclement, severing {{the last}} {{link between the}} German IX Army and the city. Elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front continued to move westward and started to engage the German XII Army moving towards Berlin. On this same day, Hitler appointed General Helmuth Weidling as {{the commander of the}} Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Reymann. Meanwhile, by 24 April 1945 elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, 25 April 1945, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated, with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day, {{it was clear that the}} German defence of the city could not do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets, since the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city. By that time, Schörner's offensive, initially successful, had mostly been thwarted, although he did manage to inflict significant casualties on the opposing Polish and Soviet units, slowing down their progress.|$|E

2500|$|Palestinian belligerency {{in these}} {{first few months}} was [...] "disorganised, {{sporadic}} and localised and for months remained chaotic and uncoordinated, if not undirected." [...] Husayni lacked the resources to mount a full-scale assault on the Yishuv, and restricted himself to sanctioning minor attacks and <b>to</b> <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> economic boycott. The British claimed that Arab rioting might well have subsided had the Jews not retaliated with firearms.|$|R

25|$|When bait-fishing in pacu-stocked ponds, anglers in Malaysia {{are advised}} to use circle hooks, size 2 or larger, and braided leather rather than nylon leaders which are easily broken by the pacu's teeth. Since pond pacu often nibble at the bait before taking it, anglers should let them swim away with the bait. If the angler simply allows the line <b>to</b> <b>tighten,</b> <b>the</b> circle hook will slide {{to the side of}} the fish's mouth and embed its point there.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, Tesla {{issued a}} recall for 345 Roadsters {{manufactured}} before April 22, 2009.

Iohannis is also widely credited with turning the city into one of Romania's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of the old downtown. During his first term, Iohannis worked with a city council that had a social democrat majority. Since 2004, during his second and third terms, his own party, FDGR, had the majority. Since 2008, FDGR has 14 out of 23 councilors, PDL has 4, PSD has 3, and PNL has 2.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Bartlett and Van Buren {{noted that}} lunar laser ranging had {{detected}} a 2-km offset between the moon’s center of figure and its center of mass. This indicates an asymmetry {{in the distribution}} of Fe (abundant in the Moon's core) and Al (abundant in its crust and mantle). If pressure did not contribute equally to spacetime curvature as does mass-energy, the moon would not be in the orbit predicted by classical mechanics. They used their measurements <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> limits on any discrepancies between active and passive mass to about 1×10−12.|$|E

25|$|Hanging is {{a common}} method for suicide. The {{materials}} necessary for suicide by hanging are readily available to the average person, compared with firearms or poisons. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason, hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners (see suicide watch). A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension the deceased is found to have both feet touching the ground, e.g., they are kneeling, crouching or standing.|$|E
25|$|Stephan's death causes Bagradian to {{withdraw}} for a time, during which Turkish soldiers capture {{the last of}} the Armenian livestock. This disaster opens rifts in Musa Dagh's society and resolve. Other setbacks follow; with the arrival of a seasoned Ottoman general from the Gallipoli front, as well as reinforcements from the regular army. The Ottomans begin <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> noose around Musa Dagh. Bagradian recovers from his grief, to form guerrilla bands to disrupt the Ottoman advance and buy more time. No ships have been sighted and attempts to contact the Allies or to seek the diplomatic intercession of the United States, still a neutral power, or Turkey’s ally, Imperial Germany, come to naught.|$|E
25|$|Many medieval {{shoes were}} made using the turnshoe method of construction, {{in which the}} upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some shoes were {{developed}} with toggled flaps or drawstrings <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> leather around the foot for a better fit. Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely, with {{the right and left}} shoe being mirror images. Around 1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method (where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be turned inside-out). The turnshoe method is still used for some dance and specialty shoes.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was seven months {{pregnant}} and had her 10-month-old daughter beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> lug nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. valve trombone), allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> joint.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Kleiser and {{a special}} effects team working on Stargate (1994) the film, used around 40 people and used self-written image-creation and {{composition}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards. The pharaoh mask in the opening credits was made out of fiber glass and was modeled in the workshop. The sequence was filmed with a motion-control camera to give a better depth of field. The film was originally planned to play out in a chronological order, but when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich edited the film <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. The Jaffa (from Stargate SG-1) look in the series was copied from the Egyptian look of Ra from the film. The look of the Goa'uld, such as Apophis, was initially based on Ra in the feature film.|$|E
