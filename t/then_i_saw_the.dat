25|$|I Was Looking at the Ceiling and <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>the</b> Sky (1995): A stage {{piece with}} {{libretto}} by June Jordan and staging by Peter Sellars. The main characters are seven young Americans from different social and ethnic backgrounds, all living in Los Angeles. The story {{takes place in}} the aftermath of the earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E
500|$|After a minute, Sirhan {{wrestled}} {{free and}} grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. [...] Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: [...] "I knew immediately it was a [...]22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> hole in the Senator's head, and I knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E

50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I,</b> John, <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> holy city, New Jerusalem, {{coming down}} out of heaven from God, {{prepared}} as a bride adorned for her husband.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> giant was blind, And {{the dwarf}} a shrewd-eyed little thing; The giant, mild, timid, obeyed the string As {{if he had}} no {{independent}} mind, [...] Or will of any kind.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, with a {{crashing}} in the bushes, the cub was {{hauled away}} from me, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Hiram at <b>the</b> rope.|$|R
2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> gray wolf, with mutton in his maw; [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> wambat waddle in the straw; [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{elephant}} {{with his}} waving trunk, [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> monkeys--mercy, how unpleasantly they--smelt!" ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{all at once}} {{a strange}} thing happened. The scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes. He looked astonished, and <b>then</b> foolish. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> color {{creeping}} up into his cheeks. As for me, I still stood there staring at him, not able to say a single word.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> when <b>the</b> Lamb broke one of {{the seven}} seals, and I heard {{one of the}} four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, “Come.” I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.

60|$|With Pannell up, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> Rube held {{in on his}} speed, or else he was tiring. Pannell hit {{the second}} slow ball for two bases. Vane sacrificed, and then the redoubtable Schultz came up. He {{appeared}} to be in no hurry to bat. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> foxy Buffalo players were working to tire the Rube. They had the situation figured. But they were no wiser than old Spears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{have had}} a great deal of trouble, <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> death of Canon Egremont in the Times soon after I went out to Australia.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{man with}} the weapon {{straighten}} himself for the effort. I saw the cold steel gleam on high, and once more I shut my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> white doe eyes, {{full of the}} old {{pleading}} expression, and {{the lips}} quivering wistfully, but I only said to myself, [...] "The old arts! That is what has overthrown Fulk again;" [...] and away I went with a rigid bow, and said nothing.|$|E
60|$|I {{squeezed}} myself {{against the}} wall and looked down upon the never-ending procession. The street was continually blocked with motor cars and taxicabs. On {{the other side of the}} way streams of people were moving all the time. I recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes. And <b>then</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> gray motor car. I held out my hand to Mr. Bundercombe.|$|R
60|$|He {{would have}} struck back had not Matai Shang interfered, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> {{two men were}} not over-friendly; for {{the manner of the}} thern was arrogant and domineering as he made it plain to the First Born that the Princess of Helium was the {{personal}} property of the Father of Therns. And Thurid's bearing toward the ancient hekkador savored not at all of liking or respect.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave his}} men {{the order to}} mount, and bade Monsieur de Lavedan enter the coach, whereupon Gilles shot me a glance of inquiry. For a second, as I stepped slowly after the Chevalier, I was minded to try armed resistance, and to convert that grey {{courtyard}} into a shambles. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> betimes <b>the</b> futility of such a step, and I shrugged my shoulders in answer to my servant's glance.|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} alone with M'ling, the dead brute, and the {{prostrate}} man. Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled {{way at the}} shattered Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered him. He scrambled to his feet. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> grey Thing returning cautiously through the trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was by chance," [...] she {{answered}} faintly. [...] "I learnt {{the truth and}} ran to warn you. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> arrow fly towards your heart, and strove to grasp it, and it pierced me. It was by chance, by such a chance as made me dream your danger." [...] And she fainted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{got down}} into the room all right, and I got the safe open, {{and there was the}} money, and, right facing me, my letters and bonds, and pretty well a hundred {{thousand}} dollars in cash. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lights flare up, and Murchison was there in his shirt and trousers.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} {{again for a}} while, uncertain, and <b>then,</b> without comprehending, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> man's eyes grow smaller and a smile play about his mouth. He looked at the Vicomtesse with a new admiration to which she paid no heed.|$|R
6000|$|My head swam. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Dolly by <b>the</b> door {{regarding}} me curiously, {{with something}} of a smile upon her lips, but anxiety still in her eyes. With a [...] "by your leave, ma'am," [...] to her, Mr. Allen took the chair abreast me.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, <b>the</b> first fully {{developed}} Krolu I had seen. He was a fine-looking savage, tall and straight with a regal carriage. To-mar {{was a handsome}} fellow; but this Kro-lu showed plainly in his every physical attribute a higher plane of evolution. While To-mar was just entering the Kro-lu sphere, this man, it seemed to me, must be close indeed to {{the next stage of}} his development, which would see him an envied Galu.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see how that's done," [...] Sir Charles murmured, drawing back. [...] "It's {{a clever}} delusion; but still, I see through it. It's like that ghost-book. Your ink was deep green; your light was green; {{you made me}} look at it long; and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> same thing written on the skin of your arm in {{complementary}} colours." ...|$|E
60|$|The simple {{statement}} {{might have}} had {{the force of a}} juggernaut. I reveled in Wright's state, but I felt sorry for Sampson. He had not outlived his pride. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> leaping thought--would this daughter side against him? Would she help to betray him? He seemed to shrivel up, to grow old while I watched him.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> black scoundrel go {{upon his}} knees beside her, fairly groveling in the dirt, {{pleading}} with her. Only {{part of what}} he said came to me, for though he was evidently laboring under the stress of passion and excitement, it was equally apparent that he did not dare raise his voice for fear of detection.|$|E
60|$|The repulsive creature, {{squatting}} {{there in}} terror, attempted to escape me and leap {{into a trap}} behind her. But this time I {{was not to be}} outwitted by any such petty subterfuge. Before she had half arisen I had grasped her by the arm, and <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> guard starting to make a concerted rush upon me from all sides, I whipped out my dagger and, holding it close to that vile breast, ordered them to halt.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> how <b>the</b> {{thing could}} be handled. This aunt, I perceived, must fall {{into line with}} my other clients. Tuppy Glossop was {{knocking}} off dinner to melt Angela. Gussie Fink-Nottle was knocking off dinner to impress the Bassett. Aunt Dahlia must knock off dinner to soften Uncle Tom. For {{the beauty of this}} scheme of mine was that there was no limit to the number of entrants. Come one, come all, the more the merrier, and satisfaction guaranteed in every case.|$|R
60|$|We {{looked and}} looked. But {{we could not}} see to our left because of the bulge of rock. We climbed back. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> one of <b>the</b> stags loping leisurely off to the left. Teague was calling. He said they had walked off the promontory, looking up, and {{stopping}} occasionally.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> halter {{had come}} off the bear and had fallen to the ground. Hiram picked it up, {{arranged}} the noose, and, holding it in his teeth began to limb after the bear. Cubby was now {{only a few feet}} under me, working steadily up, growling, and his little eyes were like points of green fire.|$|E
60|$|One evening I was in {{the camp}} seated beside a large fire and gloomily staring into the flames, when the other men, who were {{occupied}} playing cards or sipping maté, hastily rose to their feet, making the salute. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> General standing near gazing fixedly at me. Motioning to the men to resume their cards, he sat down by my side.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Swain did not stir {{from his}} seat. He was still gazing {{at me with}} a curious expression. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> world in truer colour. This good Samaritan was not only taking me into his home, but would fight for my rights with the strong brain that had lifted him out of poverty and obscurity. I stood, humbled before him.|$|E
60|$|In {{about an}} hour I made {{out that it was}} {{something}} round, with something white raised above it, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> discovered that it was a life-preserver, which supported a little stick, to which a white flag, probably a handkerchief, was attached. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that on <b>the</b> life-preserver lay a little yellow mass.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{took the}} short trail up the {{hillside}} to Stanford Mountain. It {{seemed to me}} as I came toward the camp as if those wretched shacks were huddling closer in terror. Everything was deathly still. As I came nearer the miners’ homes, I could hear sobbing. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> between <b>the</b> stilts that propped up a miner’s shack the clay red with blood. I pushed open the door. On a mattress, wet with blood, lay a miner. His brains had been blown out while he slept. His shack was riddled with bullets.|$|R
60|$|I went to Montgomery {{again and}} knelt beside him, cursing my ignorance of medicine. The fire beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams of timber glowing {{at the central}} ends and mixed with a grey ash of {{brushwood}} remained. I wondered casually where Montgomery had got his wood. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> dawn was upon us. The sky had grown brighter, the setting moon was becoming pale and opaque in the luminous blue of the day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with red.|$|R
