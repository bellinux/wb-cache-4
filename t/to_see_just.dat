5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> what it was that he was being so heavily {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{pattern of}} {{volcanism}} in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago is for each eruption site <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> a single eruption, {{and so the}} island {{is unlikely to be}} enlarged in the future by further eruptions. The heavy seas around the island have been eroding it ever since the island appeared, and {{since the end of the}} eruption almost half its original area has been lost. The island currently loses about [...] of its surface area each year.|$|E

500|$|EX Media lauds Oda's art for its [...] "crispy" [...] {{monochrome}} pictures, [...] "great use {{of subtle}} shade changes" [...] on color pages, [...] "sometimes exquisite" [...] use of angles, {{and for its}} consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features {{a lot of interesting}} perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though he complains that the panels can sometimes get [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, {{in a review}} of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer, called the episode [...] "just plain bad". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club roundly criticized the episode and awarded it a [...] "D–", calling it [...] "a famously bad episode of The X-Files." [...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to working that it’s frustrating <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the good old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E
6000|$|... "Stock-buyers!" [...] {{whispered the}} detective, {{thrusting}} me further back. [...] "Go slow. In {{the interests of}} justice, I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> what they're going to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled a}} slow, musing smile. [...] "Oh, I don't know. The more {{you see the}} more you want <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Just</b> now I feel like taking a little rest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don’t know," [...] said Malcolm, shortly. [...] "I fancied I saw something, but {{it might}} have been fancy. I’m in the mood <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{anything}} <b>just</b> now. How are you feeling now, sir?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What does grip your imagination?" [...] asked Melville. He was {{absolutely}} certain the Sea Lady {{had been talking}} this paralysis into Chatteris, and he wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how far she had gone. [...] "For example," [...] he tested, [...] "are there--by any chance--other dreams?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish we {{had gone}} yesterday," [...] {{answered}} Sam bluntly. He could read [...] "between the lines" [...] of the note he had received, and knew that Grace wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him <b>just</b> {{as much as he}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her.|$|R

60|$|Madeline was {{conscious}} of an inward burning. It required an effort for her to retain her outward tranquillity. Annoying consciousness she had also of the returning sense of new disturbing emotions.

60|$|Jimmy Skunk raised {{himself on}} his hind-legs a little <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> where Bubbling Bob dropped down in the grass. Then Jimmy began to move in that direction.

6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} the matter is with him?" [...] Fred asked, when, at a late hour, the {{partners}} were alone. [...] "Do you suppose he thinks we don't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him <b>just</b> {{because we have been}} fortunate?" ...|$|R
60|$|RUTH. [With sudden fierceness] He can't get {{anything}} to do. It's dreadful <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. He's <b>just</b> skin and bone.|$|R

60|$|As Buster sat there, {{every one}} had a splendid chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> how he looked. His coat was all black; in fact he was black all over, with the {{exception}} of his nose, which was brown. His fur was long and rather shaggy. His ears were round. His paws were big and armed with strong, wicked looking claws.|$|E
60|$|She wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> as she pleased, {{without any}} of humanity's {{previous}} vision for spectacles.

It pleased her that the lowest browny florets of the clover hung down; she cared no more. She clothed everything in fancy.|$|E
60|$|The day dragged on. Aynesworth {{hated it}} all, and was weary {{long before it}} was half over.

Aynesworth started towards him with a little exclamation. The young man's evident {{excitement}} terrified him, and he feared a tragedy. Malcolmson, too, half rose to his feet.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{idea that}} Schwartz reminds us through {{this book is}} - ''''To see what can be, not just what is''''. He explains that visualization adds value to everything and thinking big means training oneself <b>to</b> <b>see</b> not <b>just</b> what is, but what can be.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean any}} harm, Mr. Ranger; we hobos {{have a whole}} lot of time to gossip, and I'm old enough to like a nice girl in a fatherly way. I reckon the whole valley rides in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, <b>just</b> the way you do." ...|$|R
