500|$|Five years later, a local historian, J.G.Hastings, wrote a manuscript, {{entitled}} The History of the Coorong, {{which proved}} {{influential in the}} development of the legend of James Brown. In it, Hastings elaborated on the poisoning incident in which Brown had supposedly been involved. By this account, Brown, responding to repeated attacks on his livestock, poisoned some flour and left it accessible to local Aboriginal people, who subsequently stole <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> ate it, with many dying as a result. Having set the trap, Brown then rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi, swimming across the Murray mouth on his way. According to Hastings, when the case was investigated by the police, Brown's ride to Adelaide [...] "set him in good stead". Hastings wrote that at Brown's trial, it was claimed that it was impossible that Brown had poisoned <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> <b>and</b> appeared in Adelaide immediately thereafter.|$|E
