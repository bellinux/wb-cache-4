The player can engage in swoop racing to gain money, and sometimes interplanetary travel will be interrupted by enemy starfighters, which begins a minigame where the player controls a turret to shoot down the opposing starcraft. The player can also engage in a card game known as pazaak, which is similar to the game of blackjack, to gamble money.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{residents}} began {{leaving the}} Woodbridge neighborhood for the suburbs. New residents to Woodbridge were less affluent. In the 1960s, the city cleared areas {{adjacent to the}} neighborhood to support revitalization. The residents of Woodbridge organized a Citizen's District Council to preserve the neighborhood, and successfully managed to stabilize and preserve many of the remaining homes. Recent activity has shifted perception of Woodbridge from that of an up-and-coming neighborhood to a hotbed of urban revitalization, with the few properties <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> for sale typically subject to bidding wars.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{the expected}} {{value of a}} random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value {{as the number of}} repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.|$|E

The actress said that her character is determined and added, [...] "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry". [...] Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, [...] "It is nothing like that. Whatever problems <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to my character in the film are {{not because of the}} profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life". Ranaut said, [...] "In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E

[...] That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue). [...] It was a loft, a factory {{going out of business}} that had a lot of sewing machines in it. [...] Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program. [...] That was the beginning. [...] I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in a graduate program." [...] Kinshasa Conwill, former director of the museum, says that the program [...] "has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{entered the}} studio, and {{completed}} recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989. Upon release, {{the album was}} met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the Billboard200. Although his band was experiencing greater success, Kiedis' withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his personal life. This led {{to the end of}} his two-year relationship with Skye in December 1989: [...] "I had managed to stay sober by not ingesting drugs, so my body had healed from all that torturous activity, but my mind still wasn't healthy enough to work out all the problems <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in a relationship." [...] In 1990 Kiedis received a conviction for indecent exposure [...] and sexual battery in Virginia related to an incident at the George Mason University in Fairfax County in April 1989. He was ordered to pay a fine on both counts.|$|E
2500|$|This {{argument}} is, [...] "In {{a random}} selection of numbers, since all numbers eventually appear, [...] {{those that have}} not come up yet are 'due', and thus more likely to come up soon." [...] This logic is only correct if applied to a system where numbers <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> are removed from the system, such as when playing cards are drawn and not returned to the deck. In this case, once a jack {{is removed from the}} deck, the next draw is less likely to be a jack and more likely to be some other card. However, if the jack is returned to the deck, and the deck is thoroughly reshuffled, a jack is as likely to be drawn as any other card. The same applies in any other process where objects are selected independently, and none are removed after each event, such as the roll of a die, a coin toss, or most lottery number selection schemes. Truly random processes such as these do not have memory, making it impossible for past outcomes to affect future outcomes.|$|E

[...] He praised the gameplay, especially the Good Cop/Bad Cop system and the upgrades system. He also praised the absence of loading screens. However, he wrote of the graphics, [...] "there are far too many clipping issues <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so {{that there will be}} times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's a lot of fun despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer that many of us have been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked." ...|$|E
