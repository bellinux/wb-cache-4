25|$|A man {{of great}} energy and drive, Newsam's {{tendency}} to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant {{that he was not}} automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> costs.|$|E
25|$|The BC Express was {{launched}} on the 24th of June and Captain Bucey took {{her up to}} Fort George on the 29th. He was so impressed by how well she handled in the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons that he took her up to the Grand Canyon the following week, where she had no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> steaming over its infamous and deadly whirlpool. She continued to make trips between the Grand Canyon and Fort George until that September when the water levels dropped so low that Bucey decided that the Giscome Rapids were too unsafe to navigate. In October the water levels rose again and she made several trips between Fort George and Soda Creek before the season ended.|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Moves to door R.] No <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> Mrs. Erlynne.|$|E
60|$|Bud did {{not seem}} to be <b>troubled</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but lay rocking in her blue cradle and {{laughing}} at the young linnets who peeped curiously over the edge of it.|$|R
50|$|Kim persuades him to stay, wanting them {{to become}} {{partners}} {{in more ways than}} one. Victor agrees, whereupon Kim learns that he and the Flamingo are actually having no money <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> their new partnership being what he'd had in mind all along.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, I {{was always}} hoping that I could turn them right again, {{so as you}} wouldn't need to be <b>troubled</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> And so it went {{from bad to worse}} until we find {{ourselves}} here. But what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Crosse, was what you meant to do about it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all!</b> My gracious, and {{you coming}} so seldom and all, {{and the kitchen}} is a perfect sight, I {{try to keep it}} clean, but Cy will track mud all over it, I've spoken to him about it a hundred times if I've spoken once, no, you sit right there, dearie, and I'll make a fire, no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> {{practically}} no trouble at all." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Nay, 'tis no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and as your {{physician}} {{my mind is}} made up. Some wraps for her, Miss Susan.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{children}} are such dears, Mr. Tryst. Billy seems to grow every day. They're no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and quite happy. Biddy's wonderful with them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{tide was}} running out pretty rapidly {{when they reached the}} landing-stage, and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the river, but this did not <b>trouble</b> them <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and they {{proceeded}} to select their boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{it comes}} after all," [...] she continued, [...] "from certain {{original}} convictions {{which have become}} my religion. Rather a magniloquent term, perhaps, but what else am I to say? One of these is that the most absolutely selfish {{thing in the world}} is to give way to depression, to think of one's <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> except of how to overcome them. I spend many delightful hours thinking of the pleasant and beautiful things of life. I decline to waste a single second even in considering the ugly ones. Do you know that this becomes a habit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will excuse me," [...] {{said the}} gentleman contemptuously, [...] "if I am {{too much in}} advance of common {{humanity}} to <b>trouble</b> myself <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about it. I have passed the night--as indeed I pass the whole of my time now--in spiritual intercourse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This must be Flutterbudget Center," [...] {{declared}} the Wizard. [...] "You see, it's no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to find places {{if you keep}} to the right road." ...|$|E
60|$|Jemima Puddle-duck {{was rather}} {{surprised}} to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
60|$|The eagle {{seized the}} handle in his stout beak {{and found it}} was no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for him to fly {{into the air and}} carry the basket with him.|$|E
60|$|The Prince was {{so happy}} {{that he did not}} <b>trouble</b> himself <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about the time, but {{presently}} the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be <b>at</b> <b>all</b> anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me, I {{have nothing}} of any {{importance}} to tell you,' {{said the old}} man, 'and I am sure we should never have made so bold as to <b>trouble</b> you <b>at</b> <b>all</b> if it hadn't been for the youngest of our two sons here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{give myself}} the <b>trouble</b> of {{thinking}} <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about you,' said Steerforth, coolly; 'so I'm not mistaken, as it happens.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She won't be any <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> mother, and I mean {{to go and}} ask her," [...] said Hannah; and, {{putting on}} her bonnet, she set off towards the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "No <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> sir," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "I {{happen to be}} going in the {{direction}} of the docks, and know of excellent as well as cheap lodgings there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are delighted}} to see you here," [...] said Miss Thorne; [...] "you give us no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> {{and we think it}} a great favour conferred by you to come and see us--don't we, Wilfred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can," [...] I assured her. [...] "And {{there is no}} need <b>at</b> <b>all</b> for you to think about earning money yet. It is not that which <b>troubles</b> us <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> It {{is the fact that we}} have no legal claim upon you, and people may come forward at any moment who have." ...|$|R
5000|$|TV Columnist Brian Lowry of Variety {{states in}} his review, [...] "The premiere {{starts with a}} rambunctious energy that {{temporarily}} promotes a sense of good will. Stewart’s Walter Blunt goes on a bender, sings rap {{and picks up a}} transgender prostitute. When the hooker politely asks if he’s <b>troubled</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> by who she is, he replies cheerfully, “No, I’m English.” The adventure ends fantastically badly, at least for Blunt’s reputation. But from there, the series — which Ames produced with the seemingly ubiquitous Seth MacFarlane — pretty rapidly disintegrates, relying too heavily on Stewart’s madcap antics and an assortment of not particularly distinctive supporting players, including Walter’s sycophantic producers, Richard Lewis as his therapist and Romany Malco as the harried network boss." ...|$|R
60|$|In the Middle Ages, for example, {{this girl}} {{would have been}} a Damsel; and in that happy time {{practically}} everybody whose technical rating was that of Damsel was in distress and only too willing to waive the formalities in return for services rendered by the casual passer-by. But the twentieth century is a prosaic age, when girls are merely girls and have no <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Were he to stop this girl in brown and assure her that his aid and comfort were at her disposal, she would undoubtedly call that large policeman from across the way, and the romance would begin and end within the space of thirty seconds, or, if the policeman were a quick mover, rather less.|$|R
6000|$|CORNELIUS [anxious to {{cut short}} the discussion, {{which makes him}} ashamed of his house; for he guesses Broadbent's {{standard}} of comfort a little more accurately than his sister does] That's all right: it'll be no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Hweres Nora? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gif, this can't be {{the right}} road," [...] {{declared}} Jack at last. [...] "If it was as rough as this, Jed Wallop would have told us about it. He said we wouldn't have any <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in reaching Cedar Lodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} no {{intercourse}} with anybody, sir. I came here last Friday, and I hadn't spoken a word to anybody before that. I didn't know that Caldigate had been in <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> My people at Pollington {{were the first to}} tell me about it.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were not}} {{surprised}} to find that Billy Robinson's contribution to the library fund was the largest handed in by any of the scholars. Cecily said she didn't envy him his conscience. But I am afraid she measured his conscience by her own. I doubt very much if Billy's <b>troubled</b> him <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Winkle's {{bedroom is}} inside mine,' said Mr. Tupman; 'I couldn't make him {{understand}} what I wanted, if I woke him now, but I {{know he has}} a dress-suit in a carpet bag; and supposing you wore it to the ball, and took it off when we returned, I could replace it without <b>troubling</b> him <b>at</b> <b>all</b> about the matter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{the text}} was, [...] "The {{joy of the}} Lord is your strength," [...] and he said how praising God, and going on {{thinking}} about His goodness and thankfulness, {{was the way to}} make our adversaries dissolve before us, and never <b>trouble</b> us <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> just like the bands of the Moabites and Ammonites before Jehoshaphat.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wishermaydie if I don't, sir," [...] says Jo, {{reverting}} to his favourite declaration. [...] "I never done nothink yit, but wot you knows on, {{to get myself}} into no trouble. I never was in no other <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> sir, 'sept not knowin' nothink and starwation." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was how the}} Fairy, the Pixie, the Knook and the Ryl all rode in the sledge {{with their}} master the {{following}} Christmas Eve; {{and they had no}} <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in entering the new-fashioned houses and leaving toys for the children that lived in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now, gentlemen, {{standing}} up here before you, I feel {{a good deal}} like Pat, and maybe after I've spieled along for a while, I may feel so darn small that I'll be able to crawl into a Pullman hammock with no <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> at all! ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} Bathsheba and Liddy {{lived in the}} attic {{in a state of}} barricade; a {{precaution}} which proved to be needless as against Troy, for he did not appear in the neighbourhood or <b>trouble</b> them <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Bathsheba sat <b>at</b> the window till sunset, sometimes attempting to read, at other times watching every movement outside without much purpose, and listening without much interest to every sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>trouble</b> to guess, <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> my dear; {{be content}} with the plum when it falls into your mouth, and don't worry {{yourself}} as to how I manage to shake the tree to bring the fruit down." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BRENNAN (turning sharply on Mary, who {{has gone}} over to examine the things on the bureau). Come away from that, Mary. Curiosity killed a cat. Don't be touchin' her things. Remember what I told you. Or is it admirin' your mug in the mirror you are? (Turning to Miss Howard as Mary {{moves away from the}} bureau, hanging her head--shortly.) Don't you worry, ma'am. We won't <b>trouble</b> Eileen <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R
