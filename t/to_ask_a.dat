5|$|President Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, {{days after}} the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Expecting the Dutch colonial government to return, Djajakusuma and Ismail helped establish the Independent Artists (Seniman Merdeka) {{as a form of}} resistance. The group travelled throughout the city, spreading news of Indonesia's proclaimed independence while performing from an open-air truck. After the arrival of the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, the group sometimes attempted to spy on the Europeans or hide information which would be considered useful to the returning Dutch forces. Owing to this dangerous work, Djajakusuma began carrying a pistol, and went to Banten <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> kyai to make him impervious to bullets.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon, Raj, Leonard and Howard discuss Howard's {{bachelor}} party, with Howard reaffirming to Raj that strippers {{are banned}} from the party. Raj then suggests a wine tasting train trip through Napa Valley but, despite Sheldon's approval, this idea is rejected as well. Meanwhile, Amy is filming Bernadette and Penny making wedding party gifts. She begins <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question about consummation but Penny tells her to ask something normal, such as what Bernadette's married name will be.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{tasks that}} we would like to {{automate}} by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of instances together with a solution for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August 1922 Collins set {{out from}} Cork City on a {{circuitous}} tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the Bandon road via Crookstown. This led through Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as The Diamond Bar, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question of a man standing at the crossroad.

50|$|Interleague {{play has}} added a new wrinkle to the controversy.

25|$|The {{party is}} granted {{automatic}} standing by act of law. Under some environmental {{laws in the}} United States, a party may sue someone causing pollution to certain waterways without a federal permit, even if the party suing is not harmed by the pollution being generated. The law allows them to receive attorney's fees if they substantially prevail in the action. In some U.S. states, a person who believes a book, film or other work of art is obscene may sue in their own name to have the work banned directly without having <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> District Attorney to do so.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, {{this is similar to}} arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.|$|E

According to Bobby Soul, she works off the record and under the table. The NYX teenagers bring an injured Tatiana to her for help.

25|$|The Lutheran {{practice}} has varied {{at different times}} and in different countries. Thus, according to the Württemberg Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the processional cross or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and, in some cases, {{in the month of}} May or on special occasions (e.g. days of humiliation, Busstage), processions about the fields <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.|$|E
25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy what, which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
