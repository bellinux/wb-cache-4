Radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum, or <b>translucent</b> <b>medium.</b> Solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days. Solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing, shading, and orientation. Windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls. Convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties.

50|$|The process {{starts with}} {{original}} documents {{that have been}} created on a <b>translucent</b> <b>medium.</b> Such media include polyester films, vellums, linens, and translucent bond papers (bonds). Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, {{the intensity of the}} UV exposure light is adjusted using an intensity knob typically pre-marked for media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of optics, {{transparency}} (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light {{to pass through the}} material without being scattered. On a macroscopic scale (one where the dimensions investigated are much, much larger than the wavelength of the photons in question), the photons can be said to follow Snell's Law. Translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) is a superset of transparency: it allows light to pass through, but does not necessarily (again, on the macroscopic scale) follow Snell's law; the photons can be scattered at either of the two interfaces where there is a change in index of refraction, or internally. In other words, a <b>translucent</b> <b>medium</b> allows the transport of light while a transparent medium not only allows the transport of light but allows for image formation. The opposite property of translucency is opacity. Transparent materials appear clear, with the overall appearance of one color, or any combination leading up to a brilliant spectrum of every color.|$|E

50|$|Filters, such as {{diffusion}} filters {{or color}} effect filters, are also widely {{used to enhance}} mood or dramatic effects. Most photographic filters {{are made up of}} two pieces of optical glass glued together with some form of image or light manipulation material between the glass. In the case of color filters, there is often a <b>translucent</b> color <b>medium</b> pressed between two planes of optical glass. Color filters work by blocking out certain color wavelengths of light from reaching the film. With color film, this works very intuitively wherein a blue filter will cut down on the passage of red, orange, and yellow light and create a blue tint on the film. In black-and-white photography, color filters are used somewhat counter intuitively; for instance a yellow filter, which cuts down on blue wavelengths of light, can be used to darken a daylight sky (by eliminating blue light from hitting the film, thus greatly underexposing the mostly blue sky) while not biasing most human flesh tone. Certain cinematographers, such as Christopher Doyle, are well known for their innovative use of filters. Filters can be used in front of the lens or, in some cases, behind the lens for different effects.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} archival far-ultraviolet spectra from {{observations}} made by HST/STIS and FUSE {{to determine the}} column densities and rotational excitation temperatures for CO and H 2, respectively, {{along the lines of}} sight to 23 Galactic O and B stars. The sightlines have reddening values in the range E(B-V) = 0. 07 - 0. 62, sampling the diffuse to <b>translucent</b> interstellar <b>medium.</b> We find that the H 2 column densities range from 5 x 10 ^ 18 - 8 x 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2 and the CO from upper limits around 2 x 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2 to detections as high as 1. 4 x 10 ^ 16 cm^- 2. CO increases with increasing H 2, roughly following a power law of factor 2 ̃. The CO/H 2 column density ratio is thus not constant, and ranges from 10 ^- 7 - 10 ^- 5, with a mean value of 3 x 10 ^- 6. The sample segregates into "diffuse" and "translucent" regimes, the former having a molecular fraction less than 0. 25 and A_V/d< 1 mag kpc^- 1. The mean CO/H 2 for these two regimes are 3. 6 x 10 ^- 7 and 9. 3 x 10 ^- 6, respectively, significantly lower than the canonical dark cloud value of 10 ^- 4. In six of the sightlines, 13 CO is observed, and the isotopic ratio we observe (50 - 70) is consistent with, if perhaps a little below, the average 12 C/ 13 C for the ISM at large. The average H 2 rotational excitation temperature is 74 +/- 24 K, in good agreement with previous studies, and the average CO temperature is 4. 1 K, with some sightlines as high as 6. 4 K. The higher excitation CO is observed with higher column densities, consistent with the effects of photon trapping in clouds with densities in the 20 - 100 cm^- 3 range.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} two-phase drainage with experiments of air invasion into a <b>translucent</b> water-saturated porous <b>medium,</b> at low injection speeds. Air displaces the water by irregular bursts of motion, suddenly invading small portions of the medium. These periods of activity, followed by dormancy, are similar to descriptions of systems at a self-organized critical point, where a slight disturbance may induce an avalanche of activity. The fractal characteristics of the invading air structure at breakthrough are examined through static (box-counting) calculations of the air mass and through {{an evaluation of the}} time-dependent motion of the invading mass; results are compared with prior low-velocity two-phase studies in porous media. Dynamic, power-law scaling for invasion percolation is shown to be well suited to describing the structure of the invading fluid. To examine the applicability of self-organized criticality predictions to the invading fluid movement, a new image analysis procedure was developed to identify the location of individual bursting events during the drainage experiments. The predictions of selforganized criticality, namely the scaling of the occurrence of bursts to the mass of the bursts and a spatio-temporal randomness of different sized bursts, are also examined. Bursts {{of a wide range of}} sizes are shown to occur throughout the porous medium, over both time and space.

40|$|Abstract. A semisynthetic, autoclavable, {{liquid medium}} {{that does not}} require {{inclusion}} of fetal calf serum (FCS) for the successful cultivation of Leishmania promastigotes in vitro is described. The parasites were grown in com-mercially available medium 199 supplemented with 10 % FCS and 2 % mammalian urine and the growth was {{compared with the same}} medium without FCS. The growth of the parasites in the semidefined medium without FCS was found {{to be as good as}} or slightly better that with medium 199 supplemented with FCS. A number of culture media, especially liquid media, 1 – 5 de-signed for the bulk cultivation of Leishmania contain either fetal calf serum (FCS) or a blood lysate as one of their es-sential ingredients. 6 – 8 Fetal calf serum is the most expensive ingredient in these media and reliable supplies in various parts of the world, especially in developing countries, are very difficult to obtain. 9 Inclusion of a blood lysate makes the <b>medium</b> <b>translucent,</b> and preparation of a sterile blood lysate is quite difficult. 10 The commercially available media are sometimes difficult to prepare due to the involvement of many steps, and they must be sterilized by passing through membrane filters. Most of the steps in the preparation of these media need to be done in biological safety cabinets and strict aseptic precautions must be followed. However, not all of these facilities are available in many of the devel-oping countries where leishmaniasis is endemic. 9, 10 To overcome this problem, we have designed an auto-clavable liquid medium that does not require FCS or a blood lysate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} modeling of light reflection, transmission and subsurface scattering. On reflection, {{we present a}} framework of spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) measurement, data processing, compact representation, and spectrally-based image rendering. We describe two approaches for experimental measurement, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Given the measured data, we develop a numerical method for noise-filtering, data resampling and interpolation. Then we propose a method to represent compactly the spectral BRDFs in both spectral and spatial domains. Finally, we implement the represented and original spectral BRDF data for image rendering and discuss the error evaluation. ^ On transmission, we present a physically-based analytical model for light transmission at rough surfaces and develop a Monte Carlo method to simulate light transmission processes. We consider two types of light transmission processes: single and multiple scattering. We derive an analytical expression for single scattering process. For the numerical simulation, we derive an analytical expression of individual visibility function for a ray starting at any surface height, and compare it with the numerical simulation. Based on individual visibility function, we develop a Monte Carlo method to simulate both the single and multiple scattering processes for two-dimensional random surfaces. We compare the analytical model with the previous simulation and our own simulation. ^ On subsurface scattering, we present an approach to integrate the surface and subsurface scattering. Based on the splitting rule, we decompose a <b>translucent</b> object (inhomogeneous <b>medium)</b> with a rough surface into a homogeneous medium with a rough surface and an inhomogeneous medium with a plate surface. The scattering at a rough surface is described by a physically-based surface-reflection model; the scattering from the plate surface by the dipole point light source approximation of the diffusion theory. We implement this approach for rendering translucent objects based on our improved two-pass rendering technique, and discuss the contributions of surface and subsurface scattering, respectively. ...|$|R

Proper handling of occlusions is a big challenge, since the visibility function that indicates if a surface point is seen from a camera can often not be formulated in closed form, and is in general discrete and non-differentiable at oc-clusion boundaries. We present a new scene representation that enables an analytically differentiable closed-form for-mulation of surface visibility. In contrast to previous meth-ods, this yields smooth, analytically differentiable, and effi-cient to optimize pose similarity energies with rigorous oc-clusion handling, fewer local minima, and experimentally verified improved convergence of numerical optimization.

After 24 hours, roots were transversally cut into 9 slices 1 mm thick from the coronal to apical extremes, three corresponding to each root third. Then, VHNs were recorded (100 gf, 30 s) on the resin luting materials along the adhesive interface in all sections. Data were analyzed by two- way ANOVA and SNK tests (?= 0. 05). Results: A significant influence on microhardness of resin luting material in their respective shades (p< 0. 001), root third (p< 0. 001) and interactions between them was detected (p< 0. 001).

40|$|This {{doctorate}} project thesis explores {{space within}} the context of flat paper folding, spatial systems, and geometry in a 2 ‐Dimensional format. This thesis considers that space acts as an interdependent feature with the configurations of physical matter. The term “paper folding”, rather than origami, is used as the preferred term. Although both concepts are considered interchangeable by the paper folding community, origami has specific cultural associations which are outside the scope of this thesis. This thesis shows how the information of space is structurally contained in the layering process in 2 ‐Dimensions of paper folding. Space can be visualized into chunks or parts not by slicing space physically but by understanding it through folding. The properties of 2 ‐Dimensional space are explored in the flat paper folding process by visualizing the folding cycle through concyclic graphs and hyperplanes. The exploration is primarily conducted through a nominal size, single isometric square sheet of paper, which cannot be cut nor glued, and must be flat‐foldable into 2 ‐Dimensional form. The graphs are taken through the entire paper folding cycle. As the layering process is of primary importance, a <b>translucent</b> paper <b>medium</b> is used track changes during folding. The primary basis for this thesis is that space and physical form, or object, share an interdependent relationship. The experiment is based on three core ideas. First, space can be represented physically through geometry as a line, more specifically, a hyperplane. Second, space and the object represented in the folding process must remain isometric or continuous, and cannot be physically cut. And third, paper has two operative sides, one positive (front) and the other negative (reverse). The research for this thesis is based on contemporary literature and theory, and acknowledges the possibility that other relevant and valid knowledge of space may exist from other sources. There are no special facilities or equipment which is used for this work, nor does it require any human or biological subjects, or samples for study. One method proved particularly helpful in organizing many of the initial questions related to the research problem, TRIZ Analysis. TRIZ is a step‐by‐step methodology specifically developed to address ill‐defined topics. Genrich Altshuller the developed the method of TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch) or the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving during the 1950 s. 2 Altshuller discovered that patterns of technological development exist in virtually known scientific and technical discovery. Altshuller discovered that the patterns of technical knowledge followed a time‐dependent process, where both the entire life‐cycle of technological development or scientific ideas could be taken into account and could also be used to predict its next stages. The generalized principles on which TRIZ is based can be applied to virtually any field of study. Although the methodology is currently used mainly in the science and engineering fields, there are several examples which TRIZ is used in architecture. Examples include those from Joe A. Miller 3, Darrell Mann’s Computer Based TRIZ‐Systematic Innovation Methods for Architecture 4 and 40 Inventive (Architecture) Principles with Examples. 5 For a more detailed description of TRIZ the reader may consult the TRIZICZS reference. To determine where each area of study is plotted along the evolutionary graph their technological states are compared through the list of evolutionary steps listed below. As this may be a first application of TRIZ to paper folding and space, the conclusions are basically observations based on experience during the doctorate thesis project. The Evolutionary graph, Figure A is based on 5 time‐dependent stages where any subject can be graphed and compared with other related studies. The graph is created from a selection of 40 technological patterns, based on physical behavior, 21 of which were pre‐selected for this analysis. The closest area of study, at least in architectural terms, the context of which this thesis is written, isan area of spatial analysis called space syntax. The pink graph describes general spatial analyses, the green shaded area shows the space syntax plot, while the purple area show the graph of paper folding. The white areas indicate untapped potential of all respective fields. The Evolutionary Graph shows that the areas of highest potential of the paper folding model include object segmentation, mechanic substitution, and color changes. There are five areas of potential in terms of how the research problem might be approached, these include: 1) space segmentation, 2) object segmentation, 3) mechanics substitution, and 4) color changes. It was determined that a mirror line or hyperplane could be used in combination with the features identified in the Evolutionary graph to approach the thesis problem. 2 Gordon Cameron.

When k= 3, material 5 (duralumin) is segmented as another isolated region because of its unique material property, i.e., specular reflection is strongly seen on material 5 because duralmin {{is a type of}} aluminum alloys. When k= 4, material 8 (milky epoxy resin) is segmented as a blue-sky region because of its strong single scattering component. When k= 5, materials 13 and 19 (polypropylene resins, PP) are segmented as a different region. A PP resin is a <b>translucent</b> <b>medium</b> with an optically thinner property than the other translucent media except for the milky epoxy resin. In the segmentation result with k= 6, material 4 (wood) and material 14 (cowhide) are separately segmented because both of them are opaquer than the other materials segmented as the blue regions. When k= 7, material 7 (ceramic) and 17 (paper) are segmented as a new isolated region {{because of the fact that}} those materials show stronger scattering components comparing with the other opaque materials. When k= 8, material 7 (ceramic) is separated as another region. When k= 9, materials 3, 15 (acrylic), and 10 (polyvinyl chloride resin) are mainly separated. However, materials 16, 18 (polyethylene resins, PE), 11, and 12 (candles) are partially separated even though they consist of one material. This is because of the colors and the angle of illumination. When k= 10, material 2 (rubber) is separated from material 1 (paper). When k= 11, 12, some regions on the same materials are separated because of the angle of illumination. The result at k= 13 has only 12 segments which are the same as k= 12. Consequently, the translucent materials are classified into six types and the opaque materials into six. This application shows that it is reasonable to classify various opaque and translucent materials based on the decomposition by the proposed approach.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} {{emission of}} the heating coil of a Cone Calorimeter {{and the one}} of the halogen lamp of a Fire Propagation Apparatus have been studied experimentally for varying power settings. These are two standard apparatuses used for fire calorimetry. The objective is to characterize and compare the radiative flux spectrum received by a fuel sample during pyrolysis experiments. The deviation from the standard assumption of black or gray emission is discussed. It is observed that the emission of the heating coil can be approximated well to an ideal blackbody, especially in the infrared range. On the contrary, the halogen lamp emission is more complex, non gray, with an important contribution in the visible and in the near infrared ranges. The flux received by a sample exposed to these emitters is predicted using ray tracing simulations. This shows that the irradiation flux and spectrum from the cone can be accurately calculated if the coil temperature is known. The non Lambertian irradiation flux from the lamp is modeled with a combination of diffuse and collimated intensities, representing the direct emission from the lamp itself and the reflection by the mirror at the rear side. For both emitters, the irradiation is confirmed to be approximately uniform over the surface of a sample 5 cm large (maximum deviation of ± 2 % on the incident flux). The uniformity decreases for larger samples, but the ratio of the flux at the center to average flux is still 1. 04 for standard 10 cm × 10 cm samples under the cone. For illustration purposes, the influence of the spectral characteristics of the emitter is studied {{in the case of a}} sample of PMMA, a non gray <b>translucent</b> <b>medium.</b> Using recently published measurements of PMMA absorptivity, the absorbed flux by a 3 cm thick sample is predicted. In the case of an incident flux of 20 kW/m 2, the calculated average absorptivity of the sample is 0. 91 under the cone, while it is 0. 32 under the FPA lamp. These calculations involve absorption data of a virgin sample at room temperature and consequently the numerical results only hold for the initial instants of irradiation. However, the very large differences in radiative behavior show that important discrepancies in the pyrolysis behavior are expected between the two emitters. This might have consequences for fire testing and inter comparisons of flammability results worth further investigation...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of how discrete particles in the micron to submicron range behave in porous media is important {{to a number of}} environmental problems. Discrete particle behavior in the interior of a porous medium is complex and influenced by various physical and chemical factors. This work aimed to provide new insight into the physical factors influencing discrete particle movement and attachment in a uniform, saturated porous medium. As part of this aim, a new technique for visualizing discrete particle transport in the interior of a porous medium has been developed. The technique, which includes the construction of a <b>translucent</b> <b>medium</b> and the use of laser induced fluorescence for particle tracking, was used to examine the behavior of a 50 mg/L suspension of negatively charged, micron-size, non-Brownian particles in the interior of a porous medium constructed from water saturated, mono-size 4 mm diameter glass beads. Particle behavior as a function of pore fluid velocity and solid surface roughness was imaged at both the macroscopic and microscopic level. Experimental results revealed two interactions between the discrete particles and the solid phase of the medium. One, particle entrapment, resulted in the firm collection of particles at solid-solid contact points and asperities on the solid surfaces. The other, particle hindrance, resulted in non-firm interactions between the particles and the solid's contact points and surfaces. Both entrapment and hindrance were driven by gravity. Hence, the discrete particles were entrapped and hindered at the top surface of the glass beads comprising the medium, and at the upper portion of the contact points. (cont.) The entrapment mechanism was physical interlocking on surface roughness and physical straining at the contact points. Particle sedimentation and particle re-entrainment as a result of flow field perturbations were the main mechanisms contributing to the hindrance of particles. Changes in the concentrations of particles that were entrapped or hindered were observed with distance from the particle injection point. These changes, which became more significant as the fluid velocity decreased, were attributed to particle size distribution effects. Experiments conducted with an upward pore fluid velocity supported the hypothesis that particle entrapment and hindrance are driven by gravity. The comparison of the experimental results with particle transport models based on macroscopic mass balance equations demonstrated some of the short-comings of these models. Drainage tests performed using the geotechnical centrifuge and the new visualization technique e also provided initial insight into discrete particle behavior in an unsaturated porous medium. The results of these tests show that particles were scavenged by the air-water interface, adsorbed on the air-water interface of the pendular rings, and were retained by film straining. Thus, it is believed that the visualization technique developed during this work can be used to further investigations of discrete particle transport behavior in partially saturated porous media. by Joon Sik Yoon.
