5|$|Swift {{relies on}} Gospel of Matthew in this sermon (Swift quotes from <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, Matthew 7:12) {{instead of the}} other Gospels; this is {{standard}} practice for Swift, because the Gospel features a simple, non-controversial history that complements Swift's religious views.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E
25|$|This period {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, one of {{the major}} discourses of Jesus in Matthew, and <b>the</b> <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plain in the Gospel of Luke. <b>The</b> <b>Sermon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mount, which covers chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Gospel of Matthew, is the first of the Five Discourses of Matthew and is the longest piece of teaching from Jesus in the New Testament. It encapsulates many of the moral teaching of Jesus and includes the Beatitudes and the widely recited Lord's Prayer.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of <b>sermons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} his ministry.
