25|$|Rashi {{points out}} that the letter is closed on three sides and open on one; this is to teach you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{question}} about what happened after creation, but not what happened before it, or what is above the heavens or below the earth.|$|E
25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|Since {{many have}} {{undertaken}} {{to set down}} an orderly account {{of the events that}} have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed.|$|E

500|$|According to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, {{there is}} circumstantial {{evidence}} encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, [...] "Love all, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{not wish to}} kill any." [...] Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it {{as a matter of}} principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{discussing}} May's {{death and}} revival {{at the hands}} of Dr. Radcliffe in the episode, Whedon said, [...] "she’s May, so she’s kind of like, ‘Oh, that happened,’ But she now has common ground with Coulson, as if they didn’t have enough common ground as it is."

500|$|While {{visiting a}} family member in Louisiana around 1870, Washington {{attended}} a Catholic mission organized by the Paulists at a neighboring parish. After [...] "careful study", Washington was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Prior to her conversion, Washington consulted with a clergyman at her Episcopal church, {{and in response to}} his concern, she replied: [...] "Oh no, I must act up to my convictions and I shall pray hard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be given the same grace." [...] Washington became a prominent lecturer of the Catholic faith and attended the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C.|$|E
500|$|Then it says, [...] "Lay {{down all}} thoughts, {{surrender}} to the void – it is shining. <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> see the meaning of within – it is being." [...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts. But you can turn off your mind, {{and go to the}} part which Maharishi described as: [...] "Where was your last thought before you thought it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Friedrich's written {{commentary}} on aesthetics {{was limited to}} a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained {{the need for the}} artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to [...] "close your bodily eye so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." [...] He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its [...] "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803–84) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839).|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} the main melody from the Hungarian piece [...] "Csárdás" [...] by Italian {{composer}} Vittorio Monti played on violin, as a distressed Gaga (speaking in a Spanish accent) states: [...] "I {{know that we are}} young, and I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> love me/But I just can't be with you like this anymore, Alejandro." [...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By the end of the song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E
500|$|Left {{without an}} {{epicenter}} after {{the destruction of}} Pearl Roundabout in 2011, Tamarod announced their plans to stage peaceful protests in nine different locations, all in the streets, with the largest expected in Manama. One of the protests was planned near the U.S. embassy, a country that protest organizers had called on to use its influence to prevent government crackdown and protect demonstrations, which they said was an [...] "ethical responsibility" [...] for the U.S. [...] "We hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> convey our deep concern to the US State Department and the US Congress to exert a real political pressure on Bahraini regime to avoid any fatal crackdown and bloodshed," [...] they said in an open letter.|$|E

500|$|The {{passing of}} the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the {{formation}} of purity societies, such as the White Cross Army, whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature—including information on birth control—and the entertainment provided by the music halls. Josephine warned against the purity societies because of their [...] "fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> in some way promote social purity". Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as Millicent Fawcett—who was later Josephine's biographer—continued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies.|$|E
500|$|By June 1917 the Russian Revolution had {{strengthened}} the Bolsheviks, who urged {{an end to}} the war. Pankhurst's translated autobiography had been read widely in Russia, and she saw an opportunity to put pressure on the Russian people. She hoped to convince them not to accept Germany's conditions for peace, which she saw as a potential defeat for Britain and Russia. UK Prime Minister David Lloyd George agreed to sponsor her trip to Russia, which she took in June. She told one crowd: [...] "I came to Petrograd with a prayer from the English nation to the Russian nation, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> continue the war on which depends the face of civilisation and freedom." [...] Press response was divided between left and right wings; the former depicted her as a tool of capitalism, while the latter praised her devout patriotism.|$|E
500|$|Qur’ān verse 49:13 states: [...] "O humankind! We {{have created}} {{you out of}} male and female and {{constituted}} you into different groups and societies, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." [...] In Islam, according to eminent theologians such as Al-Ghazali, although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the Preserved Tablet), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts. Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.|$|E
