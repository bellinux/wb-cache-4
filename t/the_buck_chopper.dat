40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the Navy progresses {{into the twenty-first}} century, new concepts in shipboard electrical power management are being explored. One area of significant interest to the Navy is utilization of DC electrical distribution systems rather than traditional AC distribution systems. The DC Zonal Electrical Distribution System is a prime candidate for direct application to modern power distribution. This system employs solid state conversion devices to supply ships loads from one of two high voltage DC busses. One such device, a buck chopper, {{is the focus of}} this thesis. In order to validate this proposed architecture, the startup and transient performance of these choppers must be explored. <b>The</b> <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> incorporates a control technique which employs both voltage and current feedback in conjunction with feed forward. Specific advantages of this control technique with <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> circuit include power source perturbation rejection, fast dynamic response to both load and source voltage changes and a house curve for parallel buck chopper operation. The design will include both over current and thermal protection in order to prevent circuit component damage. The focus of this thesis is to validate the predicted operation of this control technique and to verify circuit performance[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Diode {{junction}} photovoltaic (PV) generators exhibit nonlinear V-I {{characteristics and}} the maximum power extractable {{varies with the}} intensity of solar radiation, temperature and load conditions. A {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) controller is therefore usually employed in PV-generator applications to automatically extract maximum power irrespective of the instantaneous conditions of the PV system. This paper presents a fuzzy logic control (FLC) scheme for extracting the maximum power from a stand-alone PV generator for use in a water pumping system. The PV-generator system comprises a solar panel, DC-DC buck chopper, fuzzy MPP tracker and permanent DC-motor driving a centrifugal pump. The fuzzy controller generates a control signal for the pulse-width-modulation generator which in turn adjusts the duty ratio of <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> to match the load impedance to the PV generator, and consequently maximizes the motor speed and the water discharge rate of a coupled centrifugal pump. The control method has been modelled in Matlab/Simulink and simulation results are presented to confirm its significantly improved power extraction performance under different sunlight conditions, when compared with a directly-connected PV-generator energized pumping system operating...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Variable liquid {{resistors}} are utilised in {{the rotor}} circuit, to control mine winders using slipring induction machines. These liquid resistors {{have a number}} of disadvantages, therefore a new drive technology is required to replace liquid controllers. A number of machine drives are discussed and a comparative study is made. A 22 kW resistively loaded buck chopper in the rotor, is used as a case study. Full design details and procedures are given for the chopper. These designs are verified by simulations and experimental results. A current control was designed and implemented for <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> in the rotor, using a PI controller and pulse width modulation. The 22 kW resistively loaded buck chopper operated exceptionally well and it is evident that it could be a viable method for replacing liquid controllers. The oscillation generated in the hoist cables are discussed and a possible counter acting acceleration method of removing these oscillations is described. A rotating oscillation system was designed and constructed for experimental purposes. From the tests undertaken on the experimental system, it was evident that by the implementation of the counter action process, it is possible to remove the oscillations in the hoist ropes...|$|E
40|$|As the Navy {{moves toward}} a modular DC Zonal Electrical Distribution System (DC ZEDS) to reduce both cost and weight over {{traditional}} radial shipboard distribution, {{there is a}} need to capitalize on technological advances currently available. The 21 st century shipboard power distribution system calls for a DC bus architecture to eliminate the need for large transformers and thousands of pounds of cable through the use of high-speed semiconductor converters. In order to realize dramatic reductions in the size and cost of shipboard components through the use of high-speed switches, switch designs must be thoroughly investigated and tested. This thesis examines the use of soft- switching techniques fOr use in the future DC-to-DC power converter modules of the DC ZEDS. Soft-switching is analyzed here primarily with a DC down/converter (<b>buck</b> <b>chopper).</b> A low voltage <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> is simulated utilizing PSPICE and modeled in the lab. A voltage feedback control algorithm is developed and utilized with the PSPICE model. A comparative study of circuit efficiency is done between a single-source and a two-source soft-switched topology. Finally, recommendations are made for further simulation and modeling to evaluate soft- switching, high-voltage performance capabilities. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into {{the design of a}} stand-alone photovoltaic water pumping system for supplying rural areas is presented. It includes a study of system components and their modelling. The PV water pumping system comprises a solar-cell-array, DC-DC <b>buck</b> <b>chopper</b> and permanent-magnet DC motor driving a centrifugal pump. The thesis focuses on increasing energy extraction by improving maximum power point tracking (MPPT). From different MPPT techniques previously proposed, the perturb and observe (P&O) technique is developed because of its ease of implementation and low implementation cost. A modified variable step-size P&O MPPT algorithm is investigated which uses fuzzy logic to automatically adjust step-size to better track maximum power point. Two other MPPT methods are investigated: a new artificial neural network (ANN) method and fuzzy logic (FL) based method. These use PV source output power and the speed of the DC pump motor as input variables. Both generate pulse width modulation (PWM) control signals to continually adjust <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> converter to maximize power from the PV array, and thus motor speed and the water discharge rate of a centrifugal pump. System elements are individually modelled in MATLAB/SIMULINK and then connected to assess performance under different PV irradiation levels. First, the MP&O MPPT technique is compared with the conventional P&O MPPT algorithm. The results show that the MP&O MPPT has faster dynamic response and eliminates oscillations around the MPP under steady-state conditions. The three proposed MPPT methods are implemented in the simulated PV water pumping system and compared. The results confirm that the new methods have improved energy extraction and dynamic tracking compared with simpler methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} a new {{maximum power point}} {{tracking}} algorithm for photovoltaic arrays is proposed. The algorithm detects the maximum power point of the PV. The computed maximum power is used as a reference value (set point) of the control system. ON/OFF power controller with hysteresis band is used to control the operation of a <b>Buck</b> <b>chopper</b> such that <b>the</b> PV module always operates at its maximum power computed from the MPPT algorithm. The major difference between the proposed algorithm and other techniques is that the proposed algorithm is used to control directly the power drawn from the PV. The proposed MPPT has several advantages: simplicity, high convergence speed, and independent on PV array characteristics. The algorithm is tested under various operating conditions. The obtained results have proven that the MPP is tracked even under sudden change of irradiation level. Keywords—Photovoltaic, {{maximum power point tracking}}, MPPT. I...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{are recognized as}} the best replacement of petrol vehicles in the future. However, there are several problems hampering their development, such as the short life span of batteries, poor performance of start-up, and a short driving range. In order to resolve these problems, a hybrid power system based on photovoltaic (PV) cells, supercapacitors, and batteries is proposed. This paper focuses on PV cells using a maximum power point track (MPPT) system based on a <b>BUCK</b> <b>chopper</b> circuit. Moreover, a novel MPPT algorithm named sectional variable step climbing (SVSC) algorithm was proposed. To validate the proposed system, two main experiments have been done. The first experiment showed that the MPP of PV cells was tracked perfectly by use of this photovoltaic power system. The second one showed that the efficiency of SVSC was higher than two existing MPPT methods, the climbing algorithm and the open-circuit voltage (OCV) algorithm...|$|R
