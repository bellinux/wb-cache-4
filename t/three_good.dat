5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of Dream Drop Distance is {{the inclusion of the}} Dream Eaters. Whilst they generally serve as the main enemies of the game, up to <b>three</b> <b>good</b> Dream Eaters, known as Spirits, can be recruited per character to assist them in battle. Spirits can be created by combining Dream Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with Spirits to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these Spirits by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the Spirits.|$|E
5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of <b>three</b> <b>good</b> fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a handsome man in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{three models}} {{of a small}} open economy to analyze the effects of terms of trade and {{exchange}} rate changes (i. e. devaluations) on labor market adjustment. First, a <b>three</b> <b>goods</b> (exportables, importables, non-tradables), four factors model is developed and used to investigate how an exogenous worsening of the intern. ationa 1 terms of trade affect labor allocation and wages. Second, a more traditional <b>three</b> <b>goods,</b> two factors model is used, and its results are compared {{to those of the}} first case. The analysis is carried out under alternative assumptions regarding wage flexibility: full flexibility, economy-wide (real) wage rigidity, and sector specific real wage rigidity.

Here the conditions under which a devaluation will be contractionary (i. e. will result in a reduction of employment) are determined. ...|$|R

[...] "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." [...] Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood.

500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have <b>three</b> <b>good</b> religious works. May they spare me {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought.

500|$|By default, Aurora {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the film's main character. Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of [...] "protagonist" [...] rightfully belongs to the <b>three</b> <b>good</b> fairies because they [...] "make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action", while Aurora acts {{as little more than a}} pawn. Butler expounded that Aurora [...] "never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesn’t act; she is acted upon. So she is definitely not the hero of the story." [...] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, [...] "Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion." [...] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as [...] "the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome." [...] However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: [...] "Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, it’s not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things just happen which we have no control over, a difficult but important lesson." [...] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beautys title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely. Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has [...] "thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions," [...] elaborating, [...] "While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events so we get to see a more authentic everyday side of her." [...] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors [...] "precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies." ...|$|E
