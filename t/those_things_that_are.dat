25|$|Wittgenstein also ponders the {{possibility}} of a language that talks about <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a private language.|$|E

The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E

500|$|In Erlewine's opinion, Marquee Moon was {{radical and}} {{groundbreaking}} primarily as [...] "a guitar rock album unlike any other". Verlaine and Lloyd's dual {{playing on the}} record strongly influenced alternative rock {{groups such as the}} Pixies, noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth, and big arena bands like U2. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune wrote that Television [...] "created a new template for guitar rock" [...] because of how Verlaine's improvised playing was weaved together with Lloyd's precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television's guitar sound with an effects pedal. He later said he had wanted to [...] "sound like them" [...] and that Marquee Moons title track had changed his [...] "way of thinking about the guitar". Verlaine's jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s, as it reminded him that [...] "none of <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> happening in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it's what kind of guitar you play or how your amp's set up. It's just ideas, you know, emotion." [...] In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Marquee Moon [...] "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" [...] whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as R.E.M. and Joy Division. Joy Division's Stephen Morris cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe said his love of Marquee Moon was [...] "second only to [...] Horses". English guitarist Will Sergeant said it was also one of his favorite records and that Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar playing was a major influence on his band Echo & the Bunnymen.|$|E

2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{journalist}} Ilie Ighel in Familia, {{there was a}} swift transition from republicanism to socialism, effected {{when some of the}} old staff left Adevărul. He wrote: [...] " [...] a sinister character emerges, in the person of Anton Bacalbașa, the graduate of two gymnasium classes, along with other unknown celebrities [...] It is certain that such transitions from one stance to the other have disgusted the cultured public, giving birth to a deep resentment for this sheet that, once taken over by Anton Bacalbașa, did not embrace scientific socialism, [...] but proceeded to insult with brutality all <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> notable in industry, commerce, finance". In retrospect, Constantin Bacalbașa also admitted that the socialist takeover was made possible because Alexandru Beldiman, the newspaper's owner, was [...] "weak-willed".|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{named his}} brand of {{epistemology}} [...] "Transcendental Idealism", and he first laid out these views {{in his famous}} work The Critique of Pure Reason. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> necessarily {{beyond the realm of}} all possible experience: the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as [...] "The Thing in Itself" [...] and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. [...] "In Kant's views, a priori concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".|$|E
2500|$|Sir Edward Coke was {{the preeminent}} jurist of his time. Coke's preeminence {{extended}} across the ocean: [...] "For the American revolutionary leaders, 'law' meant Sir Edward Coke's custom and right reason." [...] Coke defined law as [...] "perfect reason, which commands <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things". For Coke, human nature determined {{the purpose of}} law; and law was superior to any one man's reason or will. Coke's discussion of natural law appears in his report of Calvin's Case (1608): [...] "The law of nature is that which God {{at the time of}} creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction." [...] In this case the judges found that [...] "the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature: secondly, that the law of nature is part of the law of England: thirdly, that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law: fourthly, that the law of nature is immutable." [...] To support these findings, the assembled judges (as reported by Coke, who was one of them) cited as authorities Aristotle, Cicero, and the Apostle Paul; as well as Bracton, Fortescue, and St. Germain.|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{contrast}} to the Restoration, when philosophy in England was fully dominated by John Locke, the 18th century had a vigorous competition among followers of Locke. [...] Bishop Berkeley extended Locke's emphasis on perception to argue that perception entirely solves the Cartesian problem of subjective and objective knowledge by saying [...] "to be is to be perceived." [...] Only, Berkeley argued, <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> perceived by a consciousness are real. For Berkeley, the persistence of matter rests in the fact that God perceives those things that humans are not, that a living and continually aware, attentive, and involved God is the only rational explanation for the existence of objective matter. [...] In essence, then, Berkeley's skepticism leads to faith. David Hume, on the other hand, took empiricist skepticism to its extremes, and he was the most radically empiricist philosopher of the period. [...] He attacked surmise and unexamined premises wherever he found them, and his skepticism pointed out metaphysics in areas that other empiricists had assumed were material. Hume doggedly refused to enter into questions of his personal faith in the divine, but his assault on the logic and assumptions of theodicy and cosmogeny was devastating, and he concentrated on the provable and empirical {{in a way that would}} lead to utilitarianism and naturalism later.|$|E
2500|$|Then, signatories {{complain}} that [...] "Some curates of souls and preachers of the Word of God feel no shame at claiming and affirming in their sermons to the congregation that sorceresses do not exist" [...] and {{notice that the}} intention {{of the authors of the}} Malleus Maleficarum is not primarily to alleviate this ignorance but rather [...] "toil to exterminate the sorceresses by explaining the appropriate methods of sentencing and punishing them in accordance with the text of the aforementioned Bull and the regulations of the Holy Canons, thereby achieving their extermination"; finally, signatories explain why they are providing their expertise: It is consonant with reason that <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> done on behalf of the common good should also be confirmed through the common approval of the Doctors, and therefore, lest the aforementioned poorly educated curates and preachers think, in their ignorance of Holy Scripture, that the aforesaid treatise, which was composed in the manner mentioned above, is poorly supported by the determinations and pronouncements of the Doctors, they offered it for examination and comparison against Scripture to the illustrious University of Cologne or rather to certain Professors of Holy Theology, in order that if any things were found to be worthy of censure or incompatible with the Catholic Truth, they should be refuted by the judgment of those Professors, and that those things found to be compatible with the Catholic Truth should be approved.

2500|$|There are criticisms which {{contend that}} Paul's {{position}} is disingenuous because he often requests earmarks for bills that he supposedly knows will pass {{no matter which}} way he votes. [...] For example, during 2007, he requested about $400 million in earmarks in bills he voted against. A spokesman in the Fox News article says, [...] "Reducing earmarks does not reduce government spending, {{and it does not}} prohibit spending upon <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> earmarked. What people who push earmark reform are doing is they are particularly misleading the public—and I have to presume it's not by accident." [...] One group supporting fiscal conservatism finds Paul's actions with earmarks to be contradictory and cites his 2003 speech regarding the award of a Congressional Gold Medal, at which time the Congressman declared, [...] "I will continue in my uncompromising opposition to appropriations not authorized within the enumerated powers of the Constitution;" [...] however, Paul himself has inserted appropriations for projects such as the renovation of a movie theater and subsidies for the shrimp industry, whereas reportedly, [...] "neither of which is envisioned in the Constitution as an essential government function". The Congressman has responded to criticism about earmarks by providing an explanation in his weekly column. Paul says, [...] "In an already flawed system, earmarks can at least allow residents of Congressional districts to have a greater role in allocating federal funds – their tax dollars – than if the money is allocated behind locked doors by bureaucrats." ...|$|E
