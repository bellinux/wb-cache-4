40|$|We {{employed}} the Generational Accounting model in estimating the generation-specific lifetime (both {{past and the}} future) benefits/burdens and income and evaluating their values as of 2010, thus estimating the lifetime net burden ratio (= lifetime net burden/lifetime income). As a result, the following points were elucidated: 1) Among <b>the</b> <b>current</b> living <b>generations,</b> <b>the</b> lifetime net burden ratio of the 0 -year-old generation is about 25 percentage points {{higher than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>current</b> 90 -year-old generation; 2) The lifetime net burden ratio of the future generations is about 31 percentage points higher than that of the 0 -year-old generation; 3) The net burden of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> would have to be increased in order to narrow the generational gap between <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> and <b>the</b> future generations, which would inevitably lead to an expansion of the intragenerational gap of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> generations; and 4) In order to prevent conflict of interest between <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular <b>the</b> younger generations and future generations, and at the same time, narrow the intergenerational gap, it is desirable to increase the income of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular that of the younger generations, by achieving a high economic growth rate and implementing macroeconomic policy management that would inhibit increase in the risk premium included in the interest rate...|$|R

5|$|The {{performance}} of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate a forgotten or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony, which should ideally {{coincide with the}} death anniversary of the deceased. According to Sharma, the ceremony {{is central to the}} concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generationsby reciting their namesas well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to know the names of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generationshis sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties. Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar ideathat Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha. This debt is considered of utmost importance along with a person's debt to his gurus and his parents.|$|E

Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. Pair end reads have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.|$|E
