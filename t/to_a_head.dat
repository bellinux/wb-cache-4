5|$|As {{early as}} 1954, Australia {{recognised}} that the English Electric Canberra was becoming outdated and evaluated aircraft {{such as the}} Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement only rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the RAAF if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939.

5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics {{at a time}} when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Matters came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head</b> in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} {{to push a}} radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy.

The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E

He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>head.</b> Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
