5|$|In the 1900s, Bolckow, Vaughan was {{certainly}} the largest steel producer in Britain, and possibly {{the largest in the}} world. In 1905, the firm produced 820,000 tons of pig iron, which was 8.5% of Great Britain's output, and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the next largest producer. In 1907 {{it was one of the}} largest firms in Britain, with 20,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|Skilling {{believed}} that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking. As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There {{do not appear to be}} any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|This was but {{one point}} of {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest of}} Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools with fine teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.|$|E
5|$|By June 1954, 1.4 {{million acres}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had {{received}} land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on 7 July 1953, and by June 1954 it had disbursed more than $9 million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225 US dollars, which was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it.|$|E

5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's weak economy. The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Maginot Line in France, consuming {{three times as much}} concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E

The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. The law also included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E

5|$|The FA Cup {{was inaugurated}} in 1871, but Sheffield clubs {{declined}} {{to enter the}} competition as it was being played under FA rules. The first team to enter was Sheffield F.C. in the 1873–74 season. This was after an attempt to enter a Sheffield FA team was refused by the organisers. They reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by Clapham Rovers. The Sheffield FA instituted their own Challenge Cup in 1876. The cup was open to {{all the members of}} the SFA that now included many clubs outside the local area. The first final attracted a crowd of 8,000, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the FA Cup final in the same season. It was a record crowd for a cup match that would be held until the FA Cup of 1883. The match was between Heeley and Wednesday and resulted in a 2–0 win for the latter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as {{for the quality of}} their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E
