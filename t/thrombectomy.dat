40|$|Introduction. Streptococcus constellatus collectively with Streptococcus anginosus and Streptococcus intermedius {{constitute}} the Streptococcus anginosus (formerly Streptococcus milleri) group. Though they are {{commonly associated with}} abscesses, bacteremia with subsequent septic thrombophlebitis is extremely rare, and resulting mortality is infrequent. Case Presentation. We report {{a case of a}} previously healthy 60 -year-old African American female who presented with Streptococcus constellatus bacteremia associated with septic thrombophlebitis to the right ovarian vein extending into the inferior vena cava. She was urgently treated with antibiotics and anticoagulation. Conclusion. Septic thrombophlebitis has a clinical presentation that is often misleading. Therefore, a high clinical index of suspicion and the use of appropriate imaging modalities (computed tomography) are essential in recognizing and confirming this diagnosis. Prompt treatment is warranted. Surgical <b>thrombectomies</b> have been successfully replaced by a combination of antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy...|$|R

Successive <b>thrombectomies</b> failed to maintain arterial flow in the distal limb due {{to the development of}} active vasculitis. Thrombosis of the tibial arteries and recurrence of thrombosis was a persistent clinical observation. In the meantime, a cesarean section was performed, with a successful delivery of a healthy male newborn. Because of the recent cesarean section, the patient did not undergo thrombolysis.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to assess}} the {{prognosis}} of atherosclerotic popliteal aneurysms (APAs), according to whether they were occluded or patent {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Design: retrospective study. Patients and methods: fifty-two APAs were investigated in 35 patients. Nineteen were occluded (group I) and 33 patent (group II). In group I, 11 lower limbs had critical ischaemia, and eight had severe claudication. In group II, 27 were asymptomatic, 3 were painful, and 3 presented with symptomatic distal occlusion. In group I, treatment consisted of six bypasses, five <b>thrombectomies,</b> four thrombolyses, but for five APAs, no revascularisation was possible due to lack of runoff. In group II, 30 / 33 APAs were treated by graft replacement; the other three were not operated on due to the patients» poor general condition. Results: the 4 -year survival rate was 72 % in group I vs. 77 % in group II, and the limb salvage rate was 72 % in group I vs. 100 % in group II, p< 0. 01. Conclusion: prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms may avoid amputation caused by thrombosis and embolisation of runoff...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{development}} of new ideas to the ultrasound diagnostics of embologenic venous thrombosis on base of the collection of anatomical and structural functional ultrasound criteria of embologenic venous thrombus is discussed.

The analysis of frequency distribution of floating thrombi (n= 545) in addition embologenic floating thrombi (n= 302) in of inverior vein cava and comparative evaluation of unembologenic (n= 243) and embologenic (n= 302) floating thrombi from the form, the contour, structure of the thrombus and the counter, the mobility of the thrombus. The analysis of absolute and relative errors of the measuring of the length of the floating thrombus of iliac-femoral segment showed that the length of the floating thrombus is not reliable criterion of embologenic thrombus (n= 177). Ultrasound criteria of the embologenic floating thrombus and thrombi with fragmented surface were found.

40|$|In this study, the {{development}} of intraoperative angioscopy, {{the value of the}} information obtained, and the problems encountered with the procedure are reported. Eight angioscopes, 1. 5 to 2. 8 mm in diameter, with a line resolution of greater than 0. 4 mm at 5 mm, were used. One-hundred ten angioscopic investigations were performed in 46 patients; 24 at peripheral bypass surgery and 22 at coronary artery bypass surgery. These included 68 arteries, 28 new anastomoses, six old grafts, five laser angioplasties, and three in situ vein grafts. The most important finding was that angioscopic data provide information not available from probes or angiography. Angioscopic findings were responsible for a change in surgical procedures in 12 patients (26 %) including three anastomotic revisions, three alterations in graft site placement, and two repeat <b>thrombectomies.</b> The most significant technical problems were lack of steerability and insufficient irrigation, which resulted in poor angiographic images.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{transposed}} basilic vein to {{brachial artery}} arteriovenous fistula provides secondary vascular access for haemodialysis. The long-term results of such fistula are assessed in this retrospective series. Material and methods. Over a 5 -year period 75 brachiobasilic transposition fistulae were performed in 74 patients. There was a median follow up of 14 months. Results. Primary patency was achieved in 69 (92 %) of the fistulae, and secondary patency in 74 (99 %) of the fistulae. Successful interventions included angioplasties in four, and saphenous vein interposition in one, whilst three patients had failed <b>thrombectomies.</b> Dialysis was performed using 69 (92 %) of the fistulae while 6 (8 %) were never used. Of the 75 fistulae 47 (63 %) were patent at follow up. Cumulative secondary patency was 66 % at 1 year, 52 % at 2 years, and 43 % at 3 years. Complications developed in 41 (55 %), and included thrombosis, infection, stenosis, arm oedema, bleeding, steal syndrome and microaneurysm formation. Conclusions. Brachiobasilic transposition fistulae have good long-term patency rates. The complication rate, although high, {{is lower than}} that reported for PTFE grafts.

40|$|Results {{obtained}} with intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABPs) at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center from 1990 to 1995 were reviewed {{to analyze the}} indications for its use {{as well as the}} incidence and types of vascular complications that occurred. Of 86 patients (53 men and 33 women) in whom pumps were used, 66 underwent coronary bypass, 14 underwent valve replacement, and 6 underwent both coronary bypass/valve replacement. Thirteen (15 %) deaths occurred (8 coronary bypass patients, 4 valve replacement patients, and 1 coronary bypass/valve replacement patient). The indications for IABP were broadly classified as prophylactic or inability to wean. Prophylactic IABP placement preoperatively occurred in 35 (41 %) patients for profound ventricular dysfunction (27 patients), compelling coronary anatomy including critical left main disease (7 patients), and unstable angina (1 patient). Inability to wean occurred in 51 (59 %) patients. Three patients (3. 5 %) developed major vascular complications resulting in limb ischemia. All three underwent <b>thrombectomies,</b> fasciotomies, and above-knee amputations; two patients subsequently died. Vascular reconstruction was performed in two patients {{as a direct result of}} their vascular process. All three vascular complications occurred in women. Besides gender, there was no difference between IABP patients with or without vascular complications in terms of age or presence of diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, obesity, or known peripheral vascular disease. These results indicate that IABPs are effective both prophylactically and intraoperatively in patients who would not otherwise survive cardiac surgery...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveIt {{has been}} {{reported}} that a failed endovascular intervention adversely affects results of lower extremity bypass (LEB). We reviewed rates of prior endovascular intervention (PEI) in patients undergoing LEB with autologous vein for critical limb ischemia (CLI) to determine effects on graft patency, limb salvage, and amputation-free survival. MethodsRetrospective review was conducted of consecutive autologous vein LEBs performed for CLI between 2005 and 2012 at a tertiary care academic medical center. ResultsOverall, 314 autologous vein LEBs were performed for CLI, 71 % for tissue loss. TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II type D or type C lesions were present in 62 % and 25 %, respectively. The great saphenous vein was used as a conduit in 83 %, and the distal target was infrapopliteal in 60 %. The 30 -day mortality rate was 3. 5 %. Primary patency rates at 1  year and 5  years were 61 % and 45 %. Secondary patency rates at 1  year and 5  years were 88 % and 64 %, with 23 % requiring an intervention to maintain patency. The 5 -year limb salvage rate was 89 %, and the 5 -year amputation-free survival was 49 %. There were 61 patients (19 %) who had undergone a PEI and 253 (81 %) who underwent bypass with no prior endovascular intervention (NPEI). There were 19 iliac stents, 29 femoral interventions, 13 popliteal interventions, 9 crural interventions, 9 infrainguinal <b>thrombectomies,</b> and 13 infrainguinal thrombolyses. PEI and NPEI patients had similar demographics and prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors. The 1 -year primary patency rate was 62 % for NPEI patients vs 59 % for PEI patients (P = . 759). The 1 -year and 2 -year secondary patency rates were 87 % and 79 % for NPEI patients vs 89 % and 78 % for PEI patients (P =. 947). The 3 -year limb salvage rate was 89 % for NPEI patients vs 92 % for PEI patients (P =. 445). The 3 -year amputation-free survival was 59 % for NPEI patients vs 52 % for PEI patients (P =. 399). Median follow-up time was 323  days for NPEI patients (interquartile range, 83 - 918) vs 463  days for PEI patients (interquartile range, 145 - 946; P =. 275). ConclusionsOverall operative mortality, patency rates, and limb salvage for autologous vein LEB in CLI patients continue to be excellent in the endovascular era and are not necessarily affected by a prior ipsilateral endovascular procedure. Long-term survival remains poor in CLI patients requiring LEB...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesPreoperative duplex {{scanning}} of arm and forearm veins {{has increased}} the creation of autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas. However, the cumulative functional patency and durability of transposed AV fistulas (TAVF) compared with nontransposed AV fistulas (AVF) and prosthetic bridging grafts (AVG) remains ill-defined. MethodsFrom January 1998 to December 2002, 245 dialysis access procedures were performed at University Hospital and the Veteran Affairs Medical Center in New Jersey. Follow-up data were available for 125 procedures (TAVF, n = 42; AVF, n = 30; AVG, n = 53) performed in 97 patients. All access procedures were planned {{on the basis of}} preoperative duplex scans of arm and forearm veins. Functional patency was defined as ability to cannulate and hemodialyze patients successfully. Primary and secondary cumulative functional patency of TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs was determined with life table analysis, and differences were analyzed with the log-rank test. Differences in revision rates, including thrombolysis, <b>thrombectomies,</b> and operative revisions, were determined with the Fisher exact t test. ResultsMean follow-up was 18 months (range, 4 - 24 months). For TAVFs, AVFs, and AVGs, primary functional patency rate at 1 year was 76. 2 %, 53. 3 %, and 47. 2 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 67. 7 %, 34. 4 %, and 25. 5 %, respectively. Similarly, secondary functional patency rate at 1 year was 83. 2 %, 66. 7 %, and 58. 5 %, respectively, and at 2 years was 74. 6 %, 56. 2 %, and 40. 2 %, respectively. Primary and secondary functional patency rates for TAVFs were superior to those for AVGs at 1 and 2 years (P <. 001). AVFs had superior secondary functional patency rate at 2 years, compared with AVGs (P <. 05), and TAVFs had superior primary and secondary patency rates at 2 years, compared with AVFs (P <. 05). AVGs required significantly more revisions than did TAVFs (28. 5 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 001) or AVFs (36. 7 % vs 54. 7 %; P <. 05). ConclusionsPreoperative duplex scanning of upper arm and forearm veins facilitated successful creation of all types of autogenous fistulas at our institution. TAVF cumulative functional patency rates were superior compared with AVGs and AVFs. Furthermore, TAVFs and AVFs were more durable and required fewer revisions than did AVGs. When preoperative duplex criteria indicate that TAVFs can be performed, they should be the initial access of choice, because of their superior long-term patency and durability...|$|R
