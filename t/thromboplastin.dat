5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may {{be more or less}} extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Factors III and VI are unassigned, as <b>thromboplastin</b> {{was never}} identified, and {{actually}} {{turned out to}} consist of ten further factors, and accelerin {{was found to be}} activated Factor V.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulant {{therapy with}} LMWH {{is not usually}} monitored. LMWH therapy {{does not affect the}} {{prothrombin}} time (PT) or the INR, and anti-Xa levels are not reliable. It can prolong the partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (APTT) in some women, but still, the APTT is not useful for monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Lupus anticoagulant, a {{circulating}} inhibitor predisposing for thrombosis, may skew PT results, {{depending on}} the assay used. Variations between various <b>thromboplastin</b> preparations {{have in the past}} led to decreased accuracy of INR readings, and a 2005 study suggested that despite international calibration efforts (by INR) there were still statistically significant differences between various kits, casting doubt on the long-term tenability of PT/INR as a measure for anticoagulant therapy.|$|E
25|$|Factor IX was {{discovered}} in 1952 in a young patient with hemophilia B named Stephen Christmas (1947–1993). His deficiency was described by Dr. Rosemary Biggs and Professor R.G. MacFarlane in Oxford, UK. The factor is, hence, called Christmas Factor. Christmas lived in Canada, and campaigned for blood transfusion safety until succumbing to transfusion-related AIDS at age 46. An alternative name for the factor is plasma <b>thromboplastin</b> component, given by an independent group in California.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{non-specific}} laboratory {{indicators of}} EVD include a low platelet count; an initially decreased {{white blood cell}} count followed by an increased {{white blood cell count}}; elevated levels of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); and abnormalities in blood clotting often consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) such as a prolonged prothrombin time, partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, and bleeding time. Filovirions, such as EBOV, may be identified by their unique filamentous shapes in cell cultures examined with electron microscopy, but this method cannot distinguish the various filoviruses.|$|E
25|$|The CBC {{provides}} a quantified {{measure of the}} different cells in the whole blood sample from the patient. Such cells examined for in this test include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). A common sign of renal cell carcinoma is anaemia whereby the patient exhibits deficiency in red blood cells. CBC tests are vital as a screening tool for examination the health of patient prior to surgery. Inconsistencies with platelet counts are also common amongst these cancer patients and further coagulation tests, including Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial <b>Thromboplastin</b> Time (APTT) should be considered.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by <b>thromboplastin</b> (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact thrombin is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets are making the plug. Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
2500|$|Partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (PTT), or {{activated}} partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT or APTT) ...|$|E
2500|$|Other tests {{performed}} in any patient with bleeding problems are a {{complete blood count}} (especially platelet counts), activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, and fibrinogen level. Testing for factor IX may also be performed if hemophilia B is suspected. Other coagulation factor assays may be performed depending {{on the results of}} a coagulation screen. [...] Patients with von Willebrand disease typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time.|$|E
2500|$|Prolongation of the {{prothrombin}} time (PT) and the activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT) reflect the underlying consumption and impaired {{synthesis of the}} coagulation cascade.|$|E
2500|$|The contact {{activation}} (intrinsic) pathway is {{initiated by}} {{activation of the}} [...] "contact factors" [...] of plasma, and can be measured by the activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT) test.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prothrombin}} time (PT)—along with its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and {{international normalized ratio}} (INR)—are assays evaluating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. This test is also called [...] "ProTime INR" [...] and [...] "PT/INR". They are {{used to determine the}} clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage, and vitamin K status. PT measures factors I (Fibrinogen), II (Prothrombin), V (Proaccelerin), VII (Proconvertin), and X (Stuart–Prower Factor). [...] It is used in conjunction with the activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT) which measures the intrinsic pathway and common pathway.|$|E
2500|$|Anemia {{is common}} in {{children}} with SLE and develops in about 50% of cases. Low platelet and {{white blood cell counts}} {{may be due to the}} disease or a side effect of pharmacological treatment. People with SLE may have an association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (a thrombotic disorder), wherein autoantibodies to phospholipids are present in their serum. Abnormalities associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include a paradoxical prolonged partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (which usually occurs in hemorrhagic disorders) and a positive test for antiphospholipid antibodies; the combination of such findings have earned the term [...] "lupus anticoagulant-positive". [...] Another autoantibody finding in SLE is the anti-cardiolipin antibody, which can cause a false positive test for syphilis.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>thromboplastin</b> was a lab reagent, usually {{derived from}} placental sources, used to assay {{prothrombin}} times (PT time). <b>Thromboplastin,</b> by itself, could activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. When manipulated in the laboratory, a derivative could be created called partial <b>thromboplastin.</b> Partial <b>thromboplastin</b> {{was used to}} measure the intrinsic pathway. This test is called the aPTT, or activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time. It was not until much later that the subcomponents of <b>thromboplastin</b> and partial <b>thromboplastin</b> were identified. <b>Thromboplastin</b> is the combination of both phospholipids and tissue factor, both needed in the activation of the extrinsic pathway, and partial <b>thromboplastin</b> is just phospholipids without tissue factor. Tissue factor is not needed to activate the intrinsic pathway.|$|E

50|$|The partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (PTT) or {{activated}} partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT or APTT) is {{a medical}} test that characterizes blood coagulation, also known as clotting. A historical name for this measure is the Kaolin cephalin clotting time (KccT).Apart from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time {{is also used to}} monitor the treatment effects with heparin, a widely prescribed drug that reduces blood's tendency to clot.|$|E

50|$|The {{effects of}} heparin are {{measured}} in the lab by the partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time (aPTT), one of the measures {{of the time it}} takes the blood plasma to clot. Partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time {{should not be confused with}} prothrombin time, or PT, which measures blood clotting time through a different pathway of the coagulation cascade.|$|E

50|$|Tissue factor, {{also called}} {{platelet}} tissue factor, factor III, <b>thromboplastin,</b> or CD142 is a protein encoded by the F3 gene present in subendothelial tissue and leukocytes. Its {{role in the}} clotting process is the initiation of thrombin formation from the zymogen prothrombin. <b>Thromboplastin</b> defines the cascade {{that leads to the}} activation of factor X - the tissue factor pathway. In doing so it has replaced the previously named extrinsic pathway in order to eliminate ambiguity.|$|E

50|$|At {{low dose}} the {{batroxobin}} significantly shortened bleeding times and clotting times in mice and rats. So a low dose of batroxobin {{acts as a}} coagulant. Furthermore, batroxobin didn’t affect the prothrombin time, thrombin time or activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, but did lower the fibrinogen levels and released fibrinopeptide A in blood. In rabbits injection of batroxobin lead to a decrease in blood loss in liver wounds and shortened the bleeding time, coagulation time, activated partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time, prothrombin time and thrombin time.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{recombinant}} {{tissue factor}} {{is not available}} and used in some PT assays [...] Placental derivatives are still available and are used in some laboratories. Phospholipid is available as an independent reagent or in combination with tissue factor as <b>thromboplastin.</b> Complete <b>thromboplastin</b> consists of tissue factor, phospholipids (since platelets were removed from blood sample being tested), and CaCl2 to reintroduce calcium ions which were chelated by sodium citrate originally used to prevent coagulation of the sample blood during transportation and/or storage.|$|E

50|$|These {{systemic}} {{effects are}} caused by a traumatic rhabdomyolysis. As muscle cells die, they absorb sodium, water and calcium; the rhabdomyolysis releases potassium, myoglobin, phosphate, <b>thromboplastin,</b> creatine and creatine kinase.|$|E
50|$|KCT {{is similar}} to the {{activated}} partial <b>thromboplastin</b> time test, except it does not use exogenous phospholipid. Thus, a confirmatory test that uses excess phospholipid is needed to validate the presence of lupus anticoagulants.|$|E
