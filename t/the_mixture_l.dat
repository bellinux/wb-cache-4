Only for <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> of <b>L.</b> perenne and D. glomerata a higher soil NO 3 − and mineral N content were most probably related to a higher bacterial activity, possibly induced by dying roots of L. perenne.

In L. perenne and F. arundinacea the total N in root biomass was higher, while under D. glomerata the NO 3 − in the soil was higher. The lower fraction of mineral N to total N for L. perenne, F. arundinacea and <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> of <b>the</b> two suggests that their organic matter build-up/mineralization ratio was higher than for D. glomerata.

The EOs were extracted by microwave-assisted hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The chemical components of the EOs were identified by linear retention indices and mass spectra. Lethal concentrations (LC 50 and LC 95) were determined by probit analysis using larvae of Ae. aegypti between the third and the fourth instars. All EOs achieved larvicidal activity at LC 50 values lower than 115 mg/L. The lowest LC 50 value (45. 73 mg/L) corresponded to T. vulgaris EO, whereas C. martinii EO showed the highest LC 50 (LC 50 = 114. 65 mg/L).

This study investigated the interaction effect of three common starter cultures, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and S treptococcus thermophiles, on the viscosity of homemade yogurt. Using Design Expert software, a 10 -run mixture model experiment was designed to examine the textural properties developed by single or multiple inoculation of these starter cultures. All yogurt formulations reached the isoelectric point of milk and had pHs in the range 3. 97 to 4. 32.

The dianion engages in Te,Te′-chelation to the metal center in Ph 2 Ge and R 2 Sn (R = tBu, nBu, Ph) derivatives; similar behavior was noted for group 14 derivatives of L 2 – (E = S, Se).

A review of Slovenian and international conservation practices of re-attachment interventions of historical plaster layers is given, which has resulted in well-defined requirements for injection grouts that must be compatible with historical renderings in the chemical, physical and mechanical aspects. At the same time, the injection grouts had to assure good working properties in the fresh state, evaluated according properties such as fluidity, injectability, water retention, minimal shrinkage, stability, etc. Injection grouts were developed in several phases. In the framework of preliminary research 9 different injection grouts were designed. Volume stability of the injection grouts was selected as a criterion for the selection of compositions used for further researches (17 injection grouts). Injection grouts were designed based on mineral binder and filler (hydrated lime and inert limestone filler), ultra light filler (for weight reduction), tuff as puccolan additive (to increase the mechanical properties) and chemical admixture (PCE and PPh superplasticizers) to reduce the water content. The first selected measure to increase the volumetric stability of grout <b>mixtures</b> was <b>the</b> decrease of the binder to filler ratio.

40|$|Background: Current human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccines {{that are based}} on virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid protein L 1 largely elicit HPV type-specific antibody responses. In contrast, immunization with the HPV minor capsid protein L 2 elicits antibodies that are broadly cross-neutralizing, suggesting that a vaccine targeting L 2 could provide more comprehensive protection against infection by diverse HPV types. However, L 2 -based immunogens typically elicit much lower neutralizing antibody titers than L 1 VLPs. We previously showed that a conserved broadly neutralizing epitope near the N-terminus of L 2 is highly immunogenic when displayed on the surface of VLPs derived from the bacteriophage PP 7. Here, we report the development of a panel of PP 7 VLP-based vaccines targeting L 2 that protect mice from infection with carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic HPV types that infect the genital tract and skin. Methodology/Principal Findings: L 2 peptides from eight different HPV types were displayed on the surface of PP 7 bacteriophage VLPs. These recombinant L 2 VLPs, both individually and in combination, elicited high-titer anti-L 2 IgG serum antibodies. Immunized mice were protected from high dose infection with HPV pseudovirus (PsV) encapsidating a luciferase reporter. Mice immunized with 16 L 2 PP 7 VLPs or 18 L 2 PP 7 VLPs were nearly completely protected from both PsV 16 and PsV 18 challenge. Mice immunized with <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> of eight <b>L</b> 2 VLPs were strongly protected from genital challenge with PsVs representing eight diverse HPV types and cutaneous challenge with HPV 5 PsV...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe raft {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific proteins are transiently formed to accomplish important cellular tasks. Equivocally, detergent-resistant membranes were initially {{assumed to be}} identical to membrane rafts, because of similarities between their compositions. In fact, the impact of detergents in membrane organization is still controversial. Here, we use phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy to observe giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) made of erythrocyte membrane lipids (erythro-GUVs) when exposed to the detergent Triton X- 100 (TX- 100). We clearly show that TX- 100 has a restructuring action on biomembranes. Contact with TX- 100 readily induces domain formation on the previously homogeneous membrane of erythro-GUVs at physiological and room temperatures. The shape and dynamics of the formed domains point to liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered (Lo/Ld) phase separation, typically found in raft-like ternary lipid <b>mixtures.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ld</b> domains are then separated from the original vesicle and completely solubilized by TX- 100. The insoluble vesicle left, in the Lo phase, represents around 2 / 3 of the original vesicle surface at room temperature and decreases to almost 1 / 2 at physiological temperature. This chain of events could be entirely reproduced with biomimetic GUVs of a simple ternary lipid mixture, 2 : 1 : 2 POPC/SM/chol (phosphatidylcholine/sphyngomyelin/cholesterol), showing that this behavior will arise because of fundamental physicochemical properties of simple lipid mixtures. This work provides direct visualization of TX- 100 -induced domain formation followed by selective (Ld phase) solubilization in a model system with a complex biological lipid composition...|$|R
