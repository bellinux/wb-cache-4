5|$|In September 2003, {{a version}} of Newman played by actor Ian Brooker {{appeared}} in the straight-to-CD Doctor Who Unbound radio play Deadline, written by Rob Shearman and released by Big Finish Productions. The play was set {{in a world in}} which Doctor Who had never been created, existing only in <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> memories of fictional writer Martin Bannister, played by Derek Jacobi. As part of the plot of the play, Bannister was unable to clearly remember whether Newman had been Canadian or Australian, with the Newman character's accent changing according to Bannister's varying memories.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> <b>and</b> a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about {{a renewed interest in}} his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|Miller's only solo album, a 2000 concert {{recording}} entitled Solo, {{was released}} in 2010 and was well received by critics for <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> harmonic development in Miller's playing. Also in 2010, Miller joined guitarist John Scofield's new band. That year, Miller had a minor stroke. After this, he took medicine, changed his diet and lost weight; he also reduced his touring and recording. In February 2012 he traveled to Denmark to play with Klüvers Big Band; selections {{from one of the}} five concerts were released under Miller's co-leadership as Grew's Tune. In autumn 2012 he performed as a piano duo with Kenny Barron, continuing an association that had begun some years earlier. In the winter of that year he toured Europe as part of a quintet led by reeds players Yusef Lateef and Archie Shepp.|$|E

5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores <b>the</b> <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> {{struggles of}} early {{adolescent}} males {{for the purpose}} of providing a research foundation for future missiological strategies to and with this age cohort. The method used to access <b>the</b> excited <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> existential struggles of early adolescent males is to report and compare two ethnographic studies, the Early Adolescent Male Study and the Lutheran Men in Mission Male Spirituality Study. These studies show that there are five factors that excite <b>the</b> <b>imaginations</b> <b>and</b> five factors that describe the existential struggles of early adolescent males. These factors reflect the first two uses of the Law. In addition, five congregational practices are significant in engaging the faith life of the cohort. Interpreting these data from the perspective of brain research and evolutionary psychology shows that three factors in particular, the Relationship Factor, the Action Factor and the Achievement Factor, are neural-biologically determined. Ministry to and with this cohort calls for cross-generational relationships with adult males who are authentic, available, affirming, action and achievement-oriented (AAAAA) ...|$|R

25|$|Contrast this leitmotif of God's mercy with Archbishop Wulfstan’s trenchant pulpiteering and thundering sermons. Ælfric by {{no means}} {{expressed}} the popular opinion of the time.

25|$|Mondino's {{treatment}} of the skull provides only inexact directions for its dissection, suggesting that the cranial cavity was opened infrequently and with little technical skill. Nonetheless, Anathomia contains {{a description of the}} cranial nerves derived from Galen's Uses of the parts of the body of man. Furthermore, the brain is divided into three vesicles, with the anterior vesicle serving as the meeting place of the senses, the middle vesicle housing <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> <b>and</b> the posterior vesicle containing the memory. Movement of the choroid plexus is said to control mental processes by opening and closing passages between the ventricles. Mondino follows Galen and the Islamic commentators in placing the lens {{in the center of the}} eye.|$|E

500|$|Cardistry is a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "card" [...] and [...] "artistry". It {{involves the}} use of hands to create cuts, displays, fans, patterns and sequences through the use of playing cards. Various armspreads, cuts, shuffles and springs can be used. The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display. The effects are limited only by the types of cars used, <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> <b>and</b> the degree of manual dexterity of the performer. The presentation is typically neither [...] "illusionary" [...] nor purportedly [...] "magic". At least in part, the color and form of cards affect visual perceptions of the act. The visual style of the art form is often associated or compared to juggling, hackey-sack, mimes and even skateboarding.|$|E
500|$|The {{bedroom is}} Moorish in style, a popular {{inspiration}} in mid-Victorian interior design, and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle {{and in the}} chancel at St Mary's Church at Studley Royal in Yorkshire. Lilwall-Smith likened the chamber, with its [...] "Moorish-looking dome, maroon-and-gold painted furniture and large, low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs", to {{a scene from the}} Arabian Nights. Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room, suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical, even pantomime-like, character. The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale's efforts lack <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room.|$|E

500|$|Hirst {{completed}} the double 14 times, {{more than any}} other cricketer except Rhodes. Unusually for an all-rounder, for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler. Consequently, he was a key member of the Yorkshire team. His Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke described Hirst as [...] "the greatest county cricketer of all time", and journalist Jim Kilburn noted that no cricketer could [...] "capture the heart and <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> the affections more firmly than George Herbert Hirst." [...] E. W. Swanton described his typical style of play as [...] "grafting for victory without heroics". His record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket, owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of Australia which reduced the effectiveness of his bowling and batting.|$|E

It was written to be more about Magnus and Zimmerman than the [...] "zombies;" [...] by doing the opposite—the episode being more about the zombies and Magnus spending most of the episode finding a cure—it would not be as interesting. Kindler ran out of time to allow the episode to move at the correct pace, and asked James Thorpe to co-write it with him; out of the five acts, Thorpe wrote the first two acts, while Kindler wrote the remaining three. Kindler liked Thorpe's contribution towards the episode for including much of <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> <b>and</b> ideas towards it.|$|E
