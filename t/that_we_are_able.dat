5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to join the eternal.|$|E
500|$|However, Johar {{maintained}} that the new film would belong to a different milieu {{as compared to the}} original. He stated, [...] "We are adapting the film from the original but ours would be a new age version that would fit in well with today's time. We really hope <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to do justice to the original and make the remake exciting for today's generation." [...] In an interview with Filmfare, he added that the protagonist of the film would be [...] "more of an underdog", while the antagonist would be [...] "more flamboyant and menacing" [...] than the older version.|$|E
500|$|British war {{correspondent}} Philip Gibbs noted Amiens' {{effect on}} the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, [...] "the enemy...is on the defensive" [...] and, [...] "the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to strike him at many different places." [...] Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, [...] "the change has been greater {{in the minds of}} men than in the taking of territory. On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly" [...] and that, [...] "there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation." ...|$|E

Kirbi Davenport, Kilah's mother, said that [...] "everyone <b>is</b> so excited <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to do this}} in Kilah's honor but also for the other children in the United States <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will <b>be</b> saving." ...|$|R

500|$|The viaduct {{was removed}} in 1999, but the {{architectural}} group Rigga persuaded {{the city to}} preserve the paintings and the columns. Rigga {{said that if the}} murals had been removed from the columns, [...] "much of their magic would be lost". The City of Portland's Office of Transportation earmarked funds to remove ten columns; an ad hoc committee called Friends of the Columns was formed to raise money for their storage, restoration and public display, which was estimated to cost $460,000. City Commissioner Charlie Hales said, [...] "Saving the Lovejoy columns and the artwork provides a real bridge between the rich history of this industrial area and its future as a residential neighborhood. I am pleased <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to save these columns and look forward to them being placed on some of the park spaces in the River District." [...] According to the James M. Harrison Art and Design Studio, [...] "Extracting the columns both captured the space created by Tom and preserved a ruin that would continue to tell a story. The fragile paintings preserved the mighty concrete." [...] During the next five years, attempts by the city, and non-profit and entrepreneurial groups to restore the columns were unsuccessful. Boora Architects' Northwest Marshall Street Pedestrian Bridge Feasibility Study (2001), funded by the Portland Development Commission, proposed installing the columns at the intersection of Northwest 9th Avenue and Naito Parkway.|$|E
2500|$|The reason <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to choose}} least {{elements}} from subsets {{of the natural}} numbers {{is the fact that}} the natural numbers are well-ordered: every nonempty subset of the natural numbers has a unique least element under the natural ordering. [...] One might say, [...] "Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering. [...] Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering." [...] The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.|$|E
2500|$|Russell Hardin rejects such arguments. He {{argues that}} it is {{possible}} to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is [...] "to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles which will among other things [...] "depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment." [...] The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. [...] "If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding." ...|$|E
30|$|Second, due to {{the nature}} of {{treatment}} and follow-up, it is not possible to have pathology as the golden standard in patients with a complete response. But <b>we</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to provide sufficient follow-up, making false negative results rather unlikely.|$|R

2500|$|Those {{named as}} being honoured with medals were Alhaji Grunshi, Lionel Turpin, Walter Tull, William Robinson Clarke, Cy Grant, Ulric Cross, Sam King, Una Marson, Charles Drew, Norma Best and Allan Wilmot. Present to receive his medal in person, 93-year-old veteran Wilmot (former member of 1950s group The Southlanders), said: [...] "I'm glad that I'm still alive to witness it (the recognition)." [...] Also in {{attendance}} was the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, {{who said that}} the recognition is long overdue: [...] "The UK is indebted to all those servicemen and women from Africa and the Caribbean who volunteered to serve with Britain during the First and Second World Wars. It is thanks to their bravery and sacrifice <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to enjoy our freedoms today. We should also congratulate those who have worked tirelessly to place this memorial in the heart of Brixton." [...] Mayor of London Sadiq Khan spoke in his address of the [...] "courageous African and Caribbean men and women who fought with the British army during the First and Second World War", noting: [...] "As a society we must never forget the sacrifices they made. It's vital that we pass this on to future generations, connecting children with their history." ...|$|E

40|$|To a large extent, the {{dependability}} {{of complex}} distributed programs relies on {{our ability to}} effectively test and debug their executions. Such an activity requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to specify dynamic properties that the distributed computation must (or must not) exhibit, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to construct algorithms to detect these properties at run time. In this paper we formulate dynamic property specification and detection as instances of the language recognition problem. Considering boolean predicates on states of the computation as an alphabet, dynamic property specification is akin to defining a language over this alphabet. Detecting a property, on the other hand, is akin to recognizing at run time if the sentence produced by a distributed execution belongs to the language. This formal language-oriented view not only unifies {{a large body of}} work on distributed debugging and property detection, it also leads to simple and efficient detection algorithms. We give examples for the cas [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing {{the power}} of the Internet to connect people, {{regardless}} of place or time, we explore the notion of a virtual form of ethnography, suggesting online, textual interactive interviews are worthy of research consideration. This paper reports on three research projects, drawing examples from almost ten years in the evolution of Internet supported conferencing software. It is the position of this paper <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to share and develop new insights into being authors, interlocutors, online learners, online researchers, and members of an educational context. Further, <b>we</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to sustain conversations beyond the scope of many traditional face-to-face interview sessions, noting that the participants enjoyed the process and often found it hard to quit their interactions with us.
