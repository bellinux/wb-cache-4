40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} an oxygen/methane torch ignition system {{as well as the}} evaluation process of the system are presented with the purpose of characterizing the properties and performance of methane as a fuel in a propulsion system. The experimental approach to this dissertation entails the {{development and}} testing of a swirl <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> under conditions that may be seen when feeding propellant from the main storage tanks: combinations of gaseous and liquid oxygen and methane. The experimental goal of this dissertation is to display the range of operability of the igniter technology presented leading to stable and consistent ignition. The interest on liquid oxygen/Methane as a propellant combination for rocket engine propulsion has been boosted due to recent developments in commercial space exploration, along with a desire to decrease the cost of space exploration technologies. <b>Torch</b> <b>igniter</b> requirements were met in this test campaign however issues with oxidizer condition were observed in {{the second phase of the}} <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> test campaign. The <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> design modification mitigated the issues encountered in the previous design iterations of the <b>torch</b> <b>igniter.</b> A total of 310 test runs were conducted in the <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> developmental test campaign. Steady state ignition was achieved in 276 out of 310 tests. Gas/gas propellants had a 100 % ignition rate while liquid/liquid propellants had a 66 % ignition rate. The propellant quality was plotted with the saturation curve to quantify the condition of the propellant that was fed to both successful and unsuccessful test runs. The objectives of this dissertation were successfully met as the swirl <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> was proven to resist and operate reliably in a rigorous duty cycle test. The igniter demonstrated the capability of recycling within seconds if the occasion required it. ...|$|E

Conventional ignition technologies like <b>torch</b> <b>igniters</b> are more complex in sequencing and need additional components like propellant feed lines and valves.

As {{the focus}} shifts to longer missions that require multiple starts {{of the main}} engines, there exists a need to solve the significant problems associated with using spark-initiated devices. Improving the fundamental understanding of predicting the required breakdown voltage in rocket environments along with reducing electrical noise is necessary to ensure that missions can be completed successfully. To better understand spark ignition systems {{and add to the}} fundamental research on spark development in rocket applications, several parameter categories of interest were hypothesized to affect breakdown voltage: (i) fluid, (ii) electrode, and (iii) electrical. The fluid properties varied were pressure, temperature, density and mass flow rate. Electrode materials, insert electrode angle and spark gap distance were the electrode properties varied. Polarity was the electrical property investigated. Testing how breakdown voltage is affected by each parameter was conducted using three different isolated insert electrodes fabricated from copper and nickel. A spark plug commonly used in <b>torch</b> <b>igniters</b> was the other electrode. A continuous output power source connected to a large impedance source and capacitance provided the pulsing potential. Temperature, pressure and high voltage measurements were recorded for the 418 tests that were successfully completed. Nitrogen, being inert and similar to oxygen, a propellant widely used in <b>torch</b> <b>igniters,</b> was used as the fluid for the majority of testing. There were 68 tests completed with oxygen and 45 with helium. A regression of the nitrogen data produced a correction coefficient to Paschen’s Law that predicts the breakdown voltage to within 3000 volts, better than 20 %, compared to an over prediction on the order of 100, 000 volts using Paschen’s Law. The correction coefficient is based on the parameters most influencing breakdown voltage: fluid density, spark gap distance, electrode angles, electrode materials and polarity. The research added to the fundamental knowledge of spark development in rocket ignition applications by determining the parameters that most influence breakdown voltage. Some improvements to the research should include better temperature measurements near the spark gap, additional testing with oxygen and testing with fuels of interest such as hydrogen and methane. ...|$|R

40|$|The fiber {{optically}} coupled laser ignition approach summarized is under consideration {{for use in}} igniting bi-propellant rocket thrust chambers. This laser ignition approach {{is based on a}} novel dual pulse format capable of effectively increasing laser generated plasma life times up to 1000 % over conventional laser ignition methods. In the dual-pulse format tinder consideration here an initial laser pulse is used to generate a small plasma kernel. A second laser pulse that effectively irradiates the plasma kernel follows this pulse. Energy transfer into the kernel is much more efficient because of its absorption characteristics thereby allowing the kernel to develop into a much more effective ignition source for subsequent combustion processes. In this research effort both single and dual-pulse formats were evaluated in a small testbed rocket thrust chamber. The rocket chamber was designed to evaluate several bipropellant combinations. Optical access to the chamber was provided through small sapphire windows. Test results from gaseous oxygen (GOx) and RP- 1 propellants are presented here. Several variables were evaluated during the test program, including spark location, pulse timing, and relative pulse energy. These variables were evaluated in an effort to identify the conditions in which laser ignition of bi-propellants is feasible. Preliminary results and analysis indicate that this laser ignition approach may provide superior ignition performance relative to squib and <b>torch</b> <b>igniters,</b> while simultaneously eliminating some of the logistical issues associated with these systems.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber at the NACA Lewis Laboratory to determine the altitude starting characteristics of an afterburner with autoignition and with hot-streak ignition. Transient afterburner ignition data were obtained over a range of altitudes from 30, 000 to 50, 000 feet at a flight Mach number of 0. 60. Afterburner ignition with a <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> located axially at approximately {{the midpoint of the}} combustion chamber was possible over the entire range, but ignition ignition with a <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> located in the transition section 1 5 / 8 inches upstream of the turbine stators proved unsatisfactory at an altitude of 50, 000 feet due to the inability to obtain flame through the turbine. Increasing the afterburner-inlet total pressure at a constant afterburner fuel-air ratio decreased the afterburner ignition time. Hot-streak ignition was possible within 2 seconds after the time required to obtain the preset, normal afterburner fuel pressure, whereas autoignition required 4 to 7 seconds for the range of altitudes investigated. Following the ignition there was a period of oscillatory operation existing in the engine-afterburner before steady-state operation was attained. The time required for steady-state stable operation decreased as afterburner inlet total pressure increased. The duration of oscillations also decreased with hot-streak ignition because the fuel-air mixture was ignited before a large volume of combustible mixture was accumulated in the afterburner...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to LOX/methane propulsion, such as in-situ resource utilization from Mars and the Moon, and simplicity of ground operations {{due to its}} non-toxic nature. There exists a lack of fundamental understanding of the ignition physics, and flame characteristics of these propellants when related to rocket propulsion, which has created undesirably long design cycles and flight hardware that is not optimized. Motivated by these issues, {{a study of the}} ignition physics of a shear coaxial injector is proposed, in which the flow field dynamics and ignition transients will be observed through a visually accessible combustion chamber. The main goal of this work is to study the effects of geometric differences of the injector, such as recess in the liquid oxygen post and thickness of the LOX post, on the jet breakup downstream of the injector, and the flame anchoring mechanism and location. A facility was developed to support this endeavor in a safe and efficient way, including a cryogenic delivery system, a Multipurpose Optically Accessible Combustor (MOAC) with <b>torch</b> <b>igniter,</b> and a bunker with a Data Acquisition and Remote Controls system (DARCS).

For the liquid fuel, the igniter was replaced by a <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> specially made for liquid fuels. Four different gases were evaluated; methane, propane, CO 2 and N 2 in order to see the effect of both various hydrocarbons and various inert gases. A model was developed for the gaseous experiments to estimate the limit for the maximum amount of inert gases the gas turbine would be able to start on. The model suggested that CO 2 would require a larger amount of energy than N 2 for the same amount in the composition, but that varying hydrocarbons did not have any effect if looking at the mass % of inert gas in the composition. The model was also extended with ethane and hydrogen but no experiments were performed with these gases. The model gave satisfying results. It overestimated the maximum amount of inert gases which could be mixed with propane, but agreed well when comparing the two inert gases with each other.

40|$|Supercritical steam {{is used in}} a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} such as stationary power generation, locomotive and space propulsion, and chemical processing including coal and biomass gasification. Subject to availability of hydrogen and oxygen, steam generation using direct H 2 -O 2 combustion offers advantages such as zero pollutant emissions, high thermodynamic efficiency and high specific thermal power output. Direct but staged addition of high pressure liquid water to the combustor allows a broad range of process temperatures. This thesis describes a design and an experimental study of a 40 kW steam generator adapted from the aerospace field for application to coal and biomass gasification. The experimental steam generator includes a spark augmented <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> and a near stoichiometric H 2 -O 2 combustion chamber capable of operating at design pressure of 1. 5 MPa and a maximum flame zone design temperature of 3450 K. Additional steam is generated by direct injection of liquid water into the post-combustion zone to achieve gasification process temperatures in the 1100 - 1400 K range. The successful design of the present steam generator includes appropriate igniter location and timing and staging and mixing of the H 2, O 2, and H 2 O streams. Experimental results of the steam generator are presented at varying equivalence ratios and compared with equilibrium calculations. The characteristic frequencies and magnitudes of unsteadiness are quantified using power spectral density functions of measured pressure fluctuations at select location throughout the steam generator. The development of the design of the steam generator is also tracked through to its present form. Integration of the steam generator to an optically accessible entrained flow coal and biomass gasifier is discussed. Recommendations for future work including computational verification of experimental results and design improvements are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|As part of NASA's {{technology}} development of liquid methane / liquid oxygen engines for future exploration missions, two different igniters were recently studied at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The first igniter tested was an impinging injection, spark-initiated <b>torch</b> <b>igniter,</b> {{and the second}} was a microwave-generated plasma igniter. The purpose of the ignition tests was to define the ignition limits under vacuum conditions and characterize the transient start-up performance {{as a function of}} propellant mixture ratio (MR), mass flow rates, inlet temperatures, and pre-ignition chamber pressure. In addition, for the impinging igniter two different spark plugs were tested, and for the microwave igniter the magnetron filament warm-up time and the magnetron input power were both varied. The results gathered from these tests indicated that the impinging igniter is capable of operating over an MR range of 2 - 27, with methane and oxygen inlet temperatures as low as - 161 F and - 233 F, respectively. The microwave igniter was tested over an MR range of 2 - 9, with methane and oxygen inlet temperatures as low as - 90 F and - 200 F, respectively. The microwave igniter achieved ignition over this range, although an upper ignition limit was determined for the oxidizer mass flow rate. In general, the torch exhaust temperatures for the microwave igniter were not as high as those attained with the impinging igniter. The microwave igniter, however, was hot-fired 17 times and was still operational, whereas the impinging igniter spark plugs experienced thermal shock and erosion over nine hot-fire tests. It was concluded that for the microwave igniter better mixing of the propellants might be required in order to both raise the torch exhaust temperature and decrease the required magnetron input power, and for the impinging igniter the spark plug position within the igniter chamber should be varied in future tests to identify a more optimal location. All of the igniter tests were supported by the Propulsion & Cryogenics Advanced Development project, which is part of NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{here are}} two efforts {{concerning}} the application of swirl injectors to rocket engine main chamber injectors. The first study was undertaken to develop a liquid/liquid bi-centrifugal swirl injector for use with new hypergolic propellants in conjunction with KB Sciences and China Lake. The second study focuses on gas/liquid swirl injectors typically used for main chamber elements in oxidizer-rich staged combustion engines. The design, development and testing of hypergolic liquid/liquid bi-centrifugal swirl injector for use with rocket grade hydrogen peroxide (RGHP) and non-toxic hypergolic miscible fuels (NHMF) are discussed first. Cold flow tests were conducted to measure the spray cone angle and discharge coefficient of the injector, and allow for comparison with theoretical predictions to evaluate the design model. The goal of this effort was to establish a method to design swirl injectors operating in a thrust regime of 35 lbf, characteristic lengths of 30 in, and c* efficiencies above 90 %. A literature review of existing inviscid swirl models is provided. The bi-centrifugal swirler design process is described, along with the design features of the series of bicentrifugal swirl injectors that were built. Results from cold flow experiments are compared to the theoretical predictions of the models reviewed. Characteristic velocity (c*) efficiencies of 70 - 92 % were measured. Next an introduction {{will be made to}} the transition of the study into the research regarding swirl injectors for the oxidizer rich staged combustion (ORSC) cycle. The goals of the effort described here are to establish an empirical knowledge base to provide a fundamental understanding of main chamber injectors and for verification of an injector design methodology for the ORSC cycle. The derivation of the baseline operating conditions is discussed. The liquid oxygen/hydrogen (LOX/H 2) preburner and GOX/RP- 1 injector design and hardware are detailed. Two alternative injector designs chosen to explore the stability margins of this type of injector and give a quantitative comparison of the dynamic response to the baseline injector geometry are presented. The hydrogen/oxygen <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> with established heritage used in the preburner is briefly discussed. Finally, the results of igniter and preburner testing are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{proposed}} planetary exploration missions must be small, {{with low}} costs {{and a short}} development time. Relatively high-risk technologies are being accepted for such missions if they meet these guidelines. For a Mars sample-return mission, one of the higher risk technologies {{is the use of}} return propellants produced from indigenous materials such as the Martian atmosphere. This consists of 96 percent carbon dioxide, which can be processed into oxygen and carbon monoxide. This year, the NASA Lewis Research Center completed the experimental evaluation and subscale technology development of an oxygen/carbon monoxide propellant combination. Previous research included ignition characterization, combustion performance, and heat transfer characterization with gaseous propellants at room temperature. In this year s tests, we studied the ignition characteristics and combustion of oxygen and carbon monoxide at near liquid temperatures. The mixture ratio boundaries for oxygen and carbon monoxide were determined as a function of propellant temperature in a spark <b>torch</b> <b>igniter.</b> With both propellants at room temperature, the ignition range was between 0. 50 and 1. 44; and with both propellants chilled to near-liquid temperatures, it was between 2. 4 and 3. 1. Statistical analysis of the mean value of the ignition boundaries provided models that describe the combination of oxygen temperature, carbon monoxide temperature, and mixture ratio that resulted in ignition. This range is the larger boxed area shown in the figure. The smaller boxed area indicates the range at which there is a 90 -percent confidence that ignition will occur. The relatively small range at only 90 -percent confidence indicates that using the oxygen/carbon monoxide combination as its own ignition source {{may not be the best}} design for a remote engine operating on Mars. Tests also were performed in a simulated small rocket engine that used oxygen/hydrogen combustion gases as the ignition source for oxygen/carbon monoxide. In these experiments, the oxygen/carbon monoxide was successfully ignited in eight of eight tests at a mixture ratio of 0. 52. In addition, the oxygen/carbon monoxide maintained steady combustion after the oxygen/hydrogen ignition source was removed, verifying that the oxygen/carbon monoxide rocket engine should continue to be included in mission plans as return propulsion from Mars...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the progress of}} technology development of a laser ignition system at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Laser ignition has been used at MSFC in recent test series to successfully ignite RP 1 /GOX propellants in a subscale rocket chamber, and other past studies by NASA GRC have demonstrated the use of laser ignition for rocket engines. Despite the progress made {{in the study of}} this ignition method, the logistics of depositing laser sparks inside a rocket chamber have prohibited its use. However, recent advances in laser designs, the use of fiber optics, and studies of multi-pulse laser formats 3 have renewed the interest of rocket designers in this state-of the-art technology which offers the potential elimination of <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> systems and their associated mechanical parts, as well as toxic hypergolic ignition systems. In support of this interest to develop an alternative ignition system that meets the risk-reduction demands of Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT), characterization studies of a dual pulse laser format for laser-induced spark ignition are underway at MSFC. Results obtained at MSFC indicate that a dual pulse format can produce plasmas that absorb the laser energy as efficiently as a single pulse format, yet provide a longer plasma lifetime. In an experiments with lean H 2 /air propellants, the dual pulse laser format, containing the same total energy of a single laser pulse, produced a spark that was superior in its ability to provide sustained ignition of fuel-lean H 2 /air propellants. The results from these experiments are being used to optimize a dual pulse laser format for future subscale rocket chamber tests. Besides the ignition enhancement, the dual pulse technique provides a practical way to distribute and deliver laser light to the combustion chamber, an important consideration given the limitation of peak power that can be delivered through optical fibers. With this knowledge, scientists and engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and CFD Research Corporation have designed and fabricated a miniaturized, first-generation optical prototype of a laser ignition system that could be the basis for a laser ignition system for rocket applications. This prototype will be tested at MSFC in future subscale rocket ignition tests...|$|E
40|$|Second-generation {{biofuels}} utilizing lignocellulosic biomass {{are considered}} to be a promising alternative to fossil-based fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass is structurally diverse and therefore requires detailed understanding of the thermal depolymerization and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reactions to optimize the overall process. This dissertation describes the experimental work using model compounds to elucidate the role of bimetallic catalyst and control the reaction operating parameters such as temperature and hydrogen pressure to maximize energy recovery in the liquid product from biomass resource. ^ Water-gas shift (WGS) is a well-known reaction to produce hydrogen and finds application industrially in steam-reforming of methane and other fossil-based feedstocks. Traditionally, gas-phase WGS has been studied on noble metal based catalysts in experimental conditions relevant to reforming of methane. Recently, aqueous-phase reforming of oxygenated organic compounds has been considered {{to be one of the}} promising routes to produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass derivatives. One of the hypothesis in that study was that WGS played a vital role in production of hydrogen and thus it is important to quantify and qualify the contribution of WGS under aqueous reforming conditions. Platinum (Pt) and platinum-molybdenum (Pt-Mo) catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were chosen since they were studied previously for aqueous-phase reforming of glycerol. Under these conditions, kinetics of WGS were significantly altered, especially CO order which is ∼ 0. 9 compared to ∼ 0. 1 for gas-phase WGS. Furthermore, Mo is shown to alter the kinetics of WGS reaction in a similar way both in gas and liquid-phase WGS. ^ Fast-hydropyrolysis followed by in-line catalytic hydrodeoxygenation has been shown to have the potential to produce hydrocarbon fuels using hydrogen as co-feed. The objective of the research project was to identify and quantify the primary products of fast hydropyrolysis as well as establish the effect of temperature on overall product distribution. A <b>torch</b> <b>igniter</b> typically used in rocket engines was modified to design a reactor that is able to continuously feed biomass at a g min- 1 scale and complete the entire process from fast hydropyrolysis to condensation of bio-oil in a matter of 3 ̆c 70 ms at 3. 6 MPa hydrogen pressure. Levoglucosan, cellobiosan, glycolaldehyde and glucopyranosyl-β-aldehyde were the major products from cellulose pyrolysis at 500 °C. As hydropyrolysis temperature was increased in the range of 500 to 700 °C, the bio-oil product distribution shifted toward C 2 -C 5 light oxygenates. The identification and quantification of products with molecular weight higher than the monomer (levoglucosan) at 70 ms residence time compared to their absence in reactors with residence time of 2 - 3 s indicate that levoglucosan is not the sole primary product of cellulose pyrolysis. Thus a portion of levoglucosan is a result of dimer (cellobiosan) and trimer (cellotriosan) degradation. ^ Hydropyrolysis of cellulose resulted in a product distribution that retained most of the oxygen from parent cellulose. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) therefore assumes the vital part of selectively removing that oxygen as water and thus transforming the oxygenated organic compounds to fungible hydrocarbon fuels. Furfural and dihydroeugenol were the chosen model compounds to represent cellulose and lignin fraction of biomass. Discerning the role of catalyst descriptors and hydrogen pressure were the main objectives of the study. A bimetallic catalyst system comprising platinum as a hydrogenation function and an oxophilic promoter molybdenum supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) was used to achieve 100...|$|E
