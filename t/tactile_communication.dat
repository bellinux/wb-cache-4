Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
2500|$|Mate binding {{refers to}} a pre-copulatory {{courtship}} behavior where the male deposits silk onto the abdomen of the female while simultaneously massaging her {{in order to reduce}} her aggressive behavior. This action allows for initial and subsequent copulatory bouts. While both chemical and tactile cues are important factors for reducing cannibalistic behaviors, the latter functions as a resource to calm the female, exhibited [...] in the orb-weaver spider species, Nephila pilipes. Additional hypotheses suggest that male silk contains pheromones which seduce the female into submission. However, silk deposits are not necessary for successful copulation. The primary factor in successful subsequent copulation lies in the <b>tactile</b> <b>communication</b> between the male and female spider that results in female acceptance of the male. [...] The male mounts the posterior portion of the female's abdomen, while rubbing his spinnerets on her abdomen during his attempt at copulation. [...] Mate binding was not necessary for the initiation of copulation in the golden orb-weaving spider, except when the female was resistant to mating. Subsequent copulatory bouts are imperative for the male's ability to copulate due to prolonged sperm transfer, therefore increasing his probability of paternity.|$|E

This species {{has different}} ways of communicating, which include <b>tactile</b> and chemical <b>communication.</b> [...] Amyda cartilaginea has different kinds of perception channels such as visual, tactile, and vibration. It is largely solitary except during breeding. Asiatic soft-shells bury themselves for both protection and hunting; when a threat is perceived, the Asiatic soft-shell has the tendency to become aggressive. It can give off a painful bite, although it usually does not cause significant damage. Amyda cartilaginea buries itself under mud to protect itself. It has minimal interaction with humans, and does not bond with them. Therefore, the Asiatic soft-shelled turtle would not make a suitable pet and subsequently has not been domesticated. Amyda cartilaginea does not have very good eye sight. Given its habitat (canals, streams, ponds), it has fuzzy vision.|$|R

5000|$|Some lizards use <b>tactile</b> <b>communication.</b> The term tactile means touch, and lizards {{that use}} <b>tactile</b> <b>communication</b> either use direct or {{indirect}} [...] "touch" [...] {{as a form of}} communication. Some species come into direct contact with one another, such as nudging, licking, biting, or bumping another lizard. This type of direct contact may be associated with courtship (i.e., attracting a mate), or with aggressionâ€”in many lizards, fights can escalate to direct physical contact, such as biting and bumping into one another. Species that engage in these physical conflicts often rely on other forms of communication (such as visual or chemical), and resort only to physical contact when other methods of deterring potential rivals have failed. In the case of courtship, some lizards such as the male Komodo dragon, Varanus komodoensis, lick females to determine whether they are sexually receptive. While this is direct touch, it also incorporates chemical communication, as the male is detecting different chemicals present on the female's body in addition to directly touching her.|$|E
50|$|The white-fronted surili {{moves through}} the forest quadrupedally. This species also {{moves through the}} forest by leaping. In the population, solitary males have been {{observed}} in this species. For communication, the males use loud calls to demarcate the groupâ€™s territory. There is also <b>tactile</b> <b>communication,</b> which is social grooming. This is when one individuals groom another to reinforce the bonds between individuals. For reproduction, they only gives birth to a single offspring.|$|E

The members of the association are sometimes changed by {{the movement of the}} fish between burrows. Pair formation of the shrimp begins at the juvenile stage and the adults usually occur in pairs. Resin casts of burrows and the data on the daily positional change of the entrance of one burrow indicate that burrows are extensive enough to come close to the adjacent burrows within the sediment, suggesting that a solitary shrimp has a chance to acquire a mate through the connection of its burrows with the adjacent burrow. The early pair formation and the stable pair bond of this species are attributed to the difficulty in obtaining a mate owing to the discreteness of the habitat...|$|R

50|$|Captive mice are {{tolerant}} {{of others and}} display little aggression. They are normally silent, but the young squeak and make suckling sounds shortly after birth, and adults make soft clucking sounds while sleeping and just before hibernation. <b>Tactile</b> <b>communication</b> probably exists between mates and between mothers and their young.

50|$|Moths {{are known}} to engage in {{acoustic}} forms of communication, most often as courtship, attracting mates using sound or vibration. Like most other insects, moths pick up these sounds using tympanic membranes in their abdomens. An example {{is that of the}} polka-dot wasp moth (Syntomeida epilais), which produces sounds with a frequency above that normally detectable by humans (about 20 kHz). These sounds also function as <b>tactile</b> <b>communication,</b> or communication through touch, as they stridulate, or vibrate a substrate like leaves and stems.|$|E
50|$|Weaver ant colonies are {{founded by}} one or more mated females (queens). A queen lays her first clutch of eggs on a leaf and protects and feeds the larvae until they develop into mature workers. The workers then {{construct}} leaf nests and help rear new brood laid by the queen. As the number of workers increases, more nests are constructed and colony productivity and growth increase significantly. Workers perform tasks that are essential to colony survival, including foraging, nest construction, and colony defense. The exchange of information and modulation of worker behaviour that occur during worker-worker interactions are facilitated by the use of chemical and <b>tactile</b> <b>communication</b> signals. These signals are used primarily in the contexts of foraging and colony defense. Successful foragers lay down pheromone trails that help recruit other workers to new food sources. Pheromone trails are also used by patrollers to recruit workers against territorial intruders. Along with chemical signals, workers also use <b>tactile</b> <b>communication</b> signals such as attenation and body shaking to stimulate activity in signal recipients. Multimodal communication in Oecophylla weaver ants importantly contributes to colony self-organization. Like many other ant species, Oecophylla workers exhibit social carrying behavior as part of the recruitment process, in which one worker will carry another worker in its mandibles and transport it to a location requiring attention.|$|E

50|$|Lizards {{have many}} {{different}} communication needs, and have evolved several modes of communication to accommodate these needs. These modes include visual, chemical, <b>tactile,</b> and vocal <b>communication.</b> The chemical and visual communication modes are widespread among lizards, while the tactile and vibrational modes seem {{to occur in}} {{just a handful of}} lizard species. Some species use a combination of several communication modes, while others seem to rely entirely on one. Visual communication is the most well studied mode of lizard communication, but modern scientific techniques are making it easier to study the other modes. Thus, we may find that lizards traditionally thought to rely on one mode of communication may also be using another mode.|$|R
50|$|Lizards rely on many {{different}} sensory systems, including the visual, olfactory, and auditory systems. As these sensory systems {{have become more}} sophisticated, lizards have developed different modes of communication that incorporate these sensory systems, including visual, chemical, <b>tactile,</b> and vocal <b>communication.</b> Different modes of communication are well suited for different lizard habitatsâ€”for example, some function well in wet habitats, while others are suitable only in habitats with low precipitation. Most modes are associates with particular physical and behavioral traits that allow lizards to use them, such as well-developed vision. Different lizard species have unique communication needs, and they have evolved fascinating solutions that are well suited to each species to accommodate these needs.|$|R
