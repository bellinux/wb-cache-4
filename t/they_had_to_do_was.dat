500|$|Compared to the {{graphical}} changes, {{the artificial}} intelligence (AI) of the computer-controlled characters {{was only slightly}} changed. The justification given was that the team felt the AI worked very well for the first game. All <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to tweak it a little and fix some bugs. There was, however, {{a lot of work}} done in improving the multiplayer portion of the game. For FreeSpace 2, the player's personal computer was assigned a greater role in predicting the possible consequences for other players' actions. This reduced the amount of data needed to be transferred between the computers, which would result in a smoother playing experience. Beta testers were recruited to stress test and troubleshoot the multiplayer mode as well. SquadWar was implemented as an attempt to establish a sense of continuity among the players {{in the form of a}} persistent online territorial fight, along with pilot statistics and ladder rankings. Volition hoped this concept would help to establish a strong, online community and build up the game's lifespan. The process of fixing the bugs detected was even publicly published on the game's official website as the [...] "Bug Fix of the Day" [...] feature.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{said that}} [...] "Born Free" [...] was [...] "an intense episode {{that brought the}} Ice Truck Killer story to a {{satisfying}} conclusion." [...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season will be just as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Daffam of the Grenfell Action Group said, “They didn’t give a {{stuff about}} us. We were the carcass {{and they were}} the vultures. North Kensington was like a goldmine, only they didn’t have to dig for the gold. All <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to marginalise the people who were living here, and that’s what they were doing.” ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the railless {{architecture}} of the lei tai allowed a fighter to escape serious injury if they faced a more powerful opponent. All <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> leap down from the stage. This constituted a loss, but the boxer lived to fight another day. Despite this option, the Nationalist government banned the old traditions of private duels on the lei tai [...] in 1928 because too many people were dying.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Curson remembers, [...] "That really broke me up. When Eric {{got sick}} {{on that date}} , and him being black and a jazz musician, {{they thought he was}} a junkie. Eric didn't use any drugs. He was a {{diabetic}} – all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> take a blood test and they would have found that out. So he died for nothing. They gave him some detox stuff and he died, and nobody ever went into that club in Berlin again. That was the end of that club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ziegfeld {{decided to}} base {{a scene in}} his next Follies on one of Duff Gordon's fashion shows and to use Duff Gordon's girls to model the clothes. Duff Gordon warned, [...] "But {{they do not know}} how to sing or dance, let alone talk." [...] Ziegfeld assured her that all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> walk and wear the clothes. Thus was invented the Show Girl, whose job, unlike the Chorus Girl, was simply to be {{beautiful}} and to model clothes. The Duff Gordon models were already trained in the Lucile Slither to which Ziegfeld added the Ziegfeld Walk, which enabled a girl to descend a staircase in full costume in such a way as to accentuate her natural attributes without appearing ungainly.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the demise}} of the Sr. Huskies, Durham decided to pursue a Junior hockey team. From the early days the team was dubbed the Huskies as well, all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> find a league to play in. The Huskies had no chance to play in Junior Development as it was a league that {{depended}} on close locale and the closest team to Durham was Seaforth, over 80 kilometers away. They tried Jr. [...] "C" [...] and were turned down for political reasons involving the player drawing availability of potential rival teams: the Hanover Barons and Mount Forest Patriots. Midwestern Junior B and Provincial Jr. [...] "A" [...] did not work out either. As a last resort, the Huskies attempted to join the on-again off-again renegade Metro Junior A Hockey League.|$|E
2500|$|Woodhull {{learned how}} to {{infiltrate}} the all-male domain of national politics and arranged to testify on women's suffrage before the House Judiciary Committee. Woodhull argued that women already {{had the right to}} vote— all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> use it— since the 14th and 15th Amendments guaranteed the protection of that right for all citizens. The simple but powerful logic of her argument impressed some committee members. [...] Learning of Woodhull's planned address, suffrage leaders postponed the opening of the 1871 National Woman Suffrage Association's third annual convention in Washington in order to attend the committee hearing. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Isabella Beecher Hooker, saw Woodhull as the newest champion of their cause. [...] They applauded her statement: [...] "omen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their rights." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the results from the}} first quantitative readability study of plain language court forms in the United States. Sixty citizens on a jury panel were selected to respond to brief questionnaires that tested relative comprehension of plain language court forms and the corresponding traditional court forms. Results show a marked and statistically significant improvement in reader comprehension when court forms are treated for plain language. The data also suggest that because users of plain language forms understand more clearly what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and where to seek support if they need it, there may be significant economies for the court...|$|R

60|$|They knew whither Pierre was going. It had {{all been}} pre-arranged--throughout this past summer, in the musty parlour of the auberge, behind barred doors and {{shuttered}} windows--all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to follow Pierre, whom they had tacitly chosen as their leader.

60|$|Out of the Smiling Pool {{and into}} the Laughing Brook, where the brown water flows smoothly, the three little {{swimmers}} towed the big green lily-pad. It floated along of itself now, and all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to steer it clear of rocks and old logs. Once it almost got away from them, {{on the edge of}} a tiny waterfall, but all three pulling together towed it out of danger. At last, in a dear little pool with a mossy green bank, they anchored the big green lily-pad.|$|E
60|$|And yet, when Bud Strothers {{came to see}} how she {{was getting}} along, she {{convinced}} him that all was well. One evening after work, Tom came, and forced two dollars upon her. He was terribly worried. He would like to help more, but Sarah was expecting another baby. There had been slack times in his trade because of the strikes in the other trades. He did not know what the country was coming to. And it was all so simple. All <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> see things in his way and vote the way he voted. Then everybody would get a square deal. Christ was a Socialist, he told her.|$|E

60|$|But {{here there}} were only good quiet beasts, lying about like the black hulls of sloops, and blowing {{every now and then}} jets of white steam, or {{sculling}} round with their huge mouths open, for the sea- moths to swim down their throats. There were no threshers there to thresh their poor old backs, or sword-fish to stab their stomachs, or saw-fish to rip them up, or ice-sharks to bite lumps out of their sides, or whalers to harpoon and lance them. They were quite safe and happy there; and all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to wait quietly in Peacepool, till Mother Carey sent for them to make them out of old beasts into new.|$|E
60|$|Then the cat thanked {{them for}} the ham, and gave them a pocket-handkerchief and a comb, {{and told them that}} when the witch pursued them, as she {{certainly}} would, all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to throw the handkerchief on the ground and run as fast as they could. As soon as the handkerchief touched the ground a deep, broad river would spring up, which would hinder the witch's progress. If she managed to get across it, they must throw the comb behind them and run for their lives, for where the comb fell a dense forest would start up, which would delay the witch so long that {{they would be able to}} get safely away.|$|E
60|$|After Jonas had got as many {{specimens}} as he could, {{from the}} wood pile, {{he used to}} cut others in the woods, when {{he happened to be}} there, of kinds which are not commonly cut for fuel. In this way he got, after a time, more than twenty different kinds, and when they were all neatly varnished and labelled, it made a very curious collection; and it was very useful, too, sometimes; for whenever the boys found any kind of a tree in the woods which they did not know, all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> to cut a branch of it off, and bring it to the museum, and compare it with Jonas's specimens. In this way, before long, they learned the names of nearly all the trees which grew in the woods about there.|$|E
