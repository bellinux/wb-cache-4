5|$|Driberg embraced enthusiastically {{the climate}} of the 1960s and the social and {{cultural}} freedoms that the decade introduced. In 1963 he met the Kray twins, prominent London gangland figures, and began a lengthy friendship with them and their associates. In July 1964 two backbench Conservative MPs reported to <b>their</b> <b>Chief</b> Whip that Driberg and Lord Boothby (a well-known Conservative peer) had been importuning males at a dog track, and were involved with gangs of thugs.|$|E
60|$|Twenty tribes {{had joined}} the federation, and <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> had sworn eternal fealty {{to one another and}} to me. Among them were many {{powerful}} though savage nations. <b>Their</b> <b>chiefs</b> we had made kings; their tribal lands kingdoms.|$|R

5|$|He joined Hibernian aged 13, {{after he}} was spotted by <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> scout John Park. His mother Heather would {{regularly}} take Scott to Hibs training sessions in Edinburgh and Motherwell, where he was coached by Gordon Rae and Keith Wright, among others.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the Roman {{alliance}} with Aetolia, Philip's first action was to secure his northern borders. He conducted raids in Illyria at Oricum and Apollonia and seized the frontier town of Sintia in Dardania or perhaps Paionia. He marched rapidly south through Pelagonia, Lyncestis and Bottiaea and on to Tempe which he garrisoned with 4000 men. He turned north again into Thrace, attacking the Maedi and <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> city Iamphorynna before returning to Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of <b>their</b> <b>chief,</b> however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E
50|$|The Delbhna Sith Neannta ruled {{over the}} area now called Fairymount in County Roscommon. <b>Their</b> <b>chiefs</b> took the name O'Laoghog or Logue.|$|R
50|$|The Delbhna Bheag, or Delbhna Bec, {{were based}} {{in what is}} now Demifore in County Westmeath. <b>Their</b> <b>chiefs</b> took the surname Ua Maoilchallan, or Mulholland.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to further {{strengthen}} his army, Mas'ud recruited a group of Turkmens which were head by <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> Yaghmur, Qizil, Bogha and Goktash.|$|R
5|$|Before the Romans {{arrived in}} Britain, the land now forming {{the county of}} Carmarthenshire {{was part of the}} kingdom of the Demetae who gave their name to the county of Dyfed; it {{contained}} one of <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> settlements, Moridunum, now known as Carmarthen. The Romans established two forts in South Wales, one at Caerwent to control the southeast of the country, and one at Carmarthen to control the southwest. The fort at Carmarthen dates from around 75 AD, and there is a Roman amphitheatre nearby, so this probably makes Carmarthen the oldest continually occupied town in Wales.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{came to the}} chiefdom of Ichisi on March 25, 1539, {{and told}} the locals he would be merciful if <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> submitted. He visited two small towns and entered the main town of Ichisi, at the Lamar Mounds and Village Site, on March 30. The chief of Ichisi cooperated fully, and {{informed}} the Spanish about the nearby paramount chief, Ocute. De Soto erected a wooden cross {{on one of the}} mounds before heading to Ocute.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Tigers had an {{unexpectedly}} strong season. <b>Their</b> <b>chief</b> rivals, the Yomiuri Giants, lost their star player Hideki Matsui to the New York Yankees, while the Tigers saw {{the return of}} pitcher Hideki Irabu back to NPB after playing with the Texas Rangers. The Tigers won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that the Curse of the Colonel had finally been broken. The Tigers lost the Japan Series, this time to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, so the curse is presumably intact.|$|E
50|$|Saint Kuksha of the Kiev Caves was {{a missionary}} who {{converted}} many Vyatichi to Christianity (in 1115), being beheaded by <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> August 27 ca. 1115.|$|R

5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} found there and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the {{previous}} year but far from Brown's exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8–2 record but losing to <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to Canton in {{the final game of}} the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the tables on Canton, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the first of several with Brown at the helm.|$|E
5|$|In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a young runt rabbit {{who is a}} seer, {{receives}} a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction. When {{he and his brother}} Hazel fail to convince <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine other rabbits who choose to go with them. The first challenge in the small band's search for a new home comes immediately, as they are forced to elude the Owsla, the warren's military caste.|$|E
50|$|The Delbhna Teannmhagh, or Delbhna Iarthair Mhidhe, at {{one time}} {{controlled}} what is now Rathconrath in County Westmeath. <b>Their</b> <b>chiefs</b> took the surname Ua Scolaidhe or O'Scully.|$|R

5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Prince used money {{inherited}} on {{the death}} of his first wife, Martha, to marry Julia Starkey, the sister of the rector. They all moved to Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk where Prince started again to build a congregation, which grew over the subsequent one to two years. The Bishop of Ely then expelled them. Prince opened Adullam Chapel, which was also known as Cave Adullam, in the North Laine area of Brighton. Meanwhile, Starkey established himself at Weymouth. <b>Their</b> <b>chief</b> success lay in the latter town, and Prince soon moved there.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> god, Marduk. There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions {{for them to have}} arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} even many Ga still believe that <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> were {{formerly}} buried in figurative palanquins can, as Regula Tschumi writes it, be explained easily: Burials of initiates formerly involved human sacrifices and, to this day, neither uninitiated nor Christian Ga would want or be allowed to attend such funerals. Chiefs are also buried secretly, therefore it is and was difficult to say how a chief is buried when it occurs {{in the middle of}} the night. Hence, nobody outside the royal families noticed that <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> were interred in substitute palanquins.|$|R
50|$|The districts, sub-districts, {{and villages}} are arranged, not alphabetically, {{but in the}} order of {{precedence}} of <b>their</b> <b>chiefs.</b> This order is not without controversy, but protocol generally observes it.|$|R
25|$|Troops, officers, and {{officials}} {{of the army and}} administration are completely lost; they have no more confidence in <b>their</b> <b>chiefs</b> and have no idea to whom they should be loyal.|$|R
5|$|The Jain texts {{state that}} Mahavira's first disciples were eleven Brahmins who are {{traditionally}} called the eleven Ganadharas. Gautama was <b>their</b> <b>chief.</b> Others were Agnibhuti, Vayubhuti, Akampita, Arya Vyakta, Sudharman, Manditaputra, Mauryaputra, Acalabhraataa, Metraya, and Prabhasa. Mahavira's disciples {{are said to}} be led by Gautama after him, who later is said to have made Sudharman his successor. These eleven Brahmin–Ganadharas, as the early followers, were responsible for remembering and verbally transmitting the teachings of the Mahavira after his death, which {{came to be known as}} Gani-Pidaga or Jain Agamas.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{items such}} as spice and silk had {{to be paid for}} with Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also {{produced}} glass in certain locations. Chinese-produced glassware date back to the Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD). In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> enemies, the nomadic Xiongnu, than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the merchant class were frowned upon by the gentry who dominated the Han government.|$|E
5|$|Unmentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, Royton {{does not}} appear in records until 1212, when it was {{documented}} to have been a thegnage estate, or manor, comprising twelve oxgangs of land, with an annual rate of 24shillings payable by the tenant, William Fitz William, to King John. From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260. It is from this exchange that the Byron family came to use Royton as <b>their</b> <b>chief</b> place of residence until {{the early part of the}} 17th century.|$|E
50|$|Earthworms {{are also}} sold as food for human consumption. Noke is a culinary term {{used by the}} Māori of New Zealand, and refers to {{earthworms}} which are considered delicacies for <b>their</b> <b>chiefs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|No mail-clad Serfs, [3] obedient {{to their}} Lord, [...] In grim array, the crimson cross [4] demand; [...] Or gay {{assemble}} round the festive board, [...] <b>Their</b> <b>chief's</b> retainers, an immortal band.|$|R
60|$|He {{certainly}} did grow fat--if not on laughing at sorrow, certainly on something else--and his followers, although respectfully silent, showed by their smiling faces that they sympathised with <b>their</b> <b>chief's</b> hilarious mood.|$|R
