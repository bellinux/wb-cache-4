5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> starved. They are slaves; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beaten. They work hard; therefore <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} ironclads of the Ottoman fleet, the four Osmaniye-class ships were kept out of action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, since they were among the largest and most {{powerful}} vessels of the fleet and the high command decided <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved. As a result, they generally remained safely in the Sea of Marmara, though Osmaniye was briefly used as a troop transport in the Mediterranean Sea. The four ships were reduced to reserve status in Constantinople after the war, {{with the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet. The four ships were heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s, being converted into more modern barbette ships. Nevertheless, they were in poor condition by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, with many of their guns damaged or incomplete. Training exercises conducted in May highlighted the very low standard of training of their crews, and reinforced the decision not to confront the Greek Navy at sea.|$|E

[...] A 2007 disarmament and repatriation study said [...] "army units that have not yet gone through the process of brassage are usually much smaller than what <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Some non-integrated brigades have only 500 men (and are thus nothing more than a small battalion) whereas some battalions may not even have the size of a normal company (over a 100 men)." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{important}} aspect of the study of the gospels is the literary genre under which they fall. Genre [...] "is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings". Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography. Although not without critics, the position that the gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today.|$|E

2500|$|The {{debate is}} rooted in a {{literary}} question about whom Homer intended to portray as the better man, Achilles or Odysseus. [...] Socrates says he has heard Eudicus' father, Apemantus, declare {{that there is a}} parallel analogy between the artistic quality of the Iliad and the moral quality of its main character, Achilles, {{and the quality of the}} Odyssey and the quality of its main character, Odysseus. The men do not pursue this thesis, that the moral status of the characters in a work of literature has some bearing on its artistry. Socrates does resurrect the idea in the Republic, however, when he argues that Homer's classics would be better books if Achilles and the other warriors were presented as always righteous. Socrates says that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rewritten to this effect.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{study of}} the Gospels must first {{determine}} the genre under which they fall, in order to interpret them correctly, since genre [...] "is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings". The gospels authors may have intended to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies, which are different genres and have {{a tremendous impact on}} how <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interpreted. Among contemporary scholars, there is consensus that the gospels are a type of ancient biography, though Rudolf Bultmann notes that the gospel authors had no interest in history or in a historical Jesus and Robert Price notes that Robert M. Fowler, Frank Kermode and Randel Helms demonstrate that the gospels are a fictional composition, while Michael Vines notes that the gospel of Mark may have aspects similar to a Jewish novel. Some myth proponents suggest that some parts of the New Testament were meant to appeal to Gentiles as familiar allegories rather than history.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} they were that <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and you may help them to become what {{they are capable of}} being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you need to focus on in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership you want in an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E
