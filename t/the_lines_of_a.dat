5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, President McCall and the {{trustees}} reorganized the institution along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small university. The curriculum was distributed among three graduate-professional schools—Theology, headed by Dean Penrose St. Amant; Religious Education, led by Dean Gaines S.

25|$|In April 1921, the IRA {{was again}} reorganised, {{in line with}} the Dáil's {{endorsement}} of its actions, along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular army. Divisions were created based on region, with commanders being given responsibility, in theory, for large geographical areas. In practice, this had little effect on the localised nature of the guerrilla warfare.|$|E

25|$|Most writing {{systems are}} not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, {{includes}} numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &, and the phonemic letter clusters are a complex match to sound. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> syllabary, such as Chinese ("logo-syllabic"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian ("logo-consonantal").|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1940, Daniel Mayer was asked by Leon Blum to {{reconstitute}} the SFIO (in ruins because of Paul Faure's defection to the Vichy regime). In March 1941 Daniel Mayer created, with other socialists like Suzanne Buisson and Félix Gouin, the Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) in Nîmes. The same thing was created by Jean-Baptiste Lebas in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais (administratively joined with Belgium) in January 1941, along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prior network created in September 1940.|$|E
25|$|The most voluminous legal {{material}} written {{after the}} 8th century {{takes the form}} of notes upon that earlier material. There have been numerous questions about the degree to which such glossators understood the material they worked on. However, {{it is also possible that}} in some cases jurists used the earlier material for a legitimate method of explaining how the law had come to work. This material takes two main forms: glossing between <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> text, and mini texts that begin with a quote from earlier legal material.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of scholars consider {{the book to}} {{be made up of}} six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between Yahweh and the various groups within the Israelite community. In the course of the book's three or four chapters, Yahweh is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of Moses are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenant—one of the major themes throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep Yahweh's statutes.|$|E

25|$|The Colony (as the Belgians called it) {{was laid}} out {{somewhat}} on <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garden city with broad streets and open spaces and was provided with a grocer and butcher, several other shops based in people’s homes; a Roman Catholic church; a 100-bed hospital; a laundry and bathhouse. There was also a school for about 600 pupils. There was a sovereign British Sub-Post Office, on sovereign Belgian soil, selling British stamps and postal orders, etc., but staffed by Belgian postal workers. There was also a football pitch. The swimming team made use of the River Wear. For live entertainment of various sorts, the colonists had {{the use of the}} Birtley Hall, in peace-time the village's cinema and theatre. There was little need for the Belgians to go into Birtley.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Annadurai {{and other}} leaders split up and {{established}} Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Annadurai was initially more radical than Periyar in his demand for a separate Dravida Nadu. In highlighting the demand for Dravida Nadu, the economics of exploitation by the Hindi-speaking, Aryan, Brahminical North was elaborated upon. It was contended that Dravida Nadu had {{been transformed into a}} virtual marketplace for north Indian products. And, thus, Annadurai explained that to change this situation, a separate Dravida Nadu must be demanded. Throughout the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy spoke along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trifurcation of India, that is dividing the existing geographical region into Dravida Nadu, Muslim India (Pakistan), and Aryan Land (Hindustan). In public meetings that he addressed between March and June 1940, he projected the three-nation doctrine as the only solution which could end the political impasse in the country.|$|E
25|$|When {{design work}} began in November 1940, the AC1 was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} 2 pounder gun-equipped vehicle, that was intended to be a true Cruiser tank, with a weight of between 16 and 20 tonnes. Due to a lack of home grown experience in tank design a mission was sent to the US to examine the M3 design and Colonel W.D. Watson MC, an artillery officer with many years of tank design experience was provided by the UK. He arrived in December 1940. Like the Canadian Ram, the Australian Cruiser was {{to be based on the}} engine, drive train, and lower hull of the American M3 Medium tank, mated to an upper hull and turret built closely along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> British Crusader. By 1942, attempting to keep pace with German tank developments, the design specification had become more like an American medium tank, resulting in a heavier design and a higher silhouette profile.|$|E

25|$|The {{suburban}} {{shopping center}} concept evolved {{further in the}} United States after World War II. Bellevue Shopping Square (now known as Bellevue Square) opened in 1946 in Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. Town & Country Village also opened in 1946 in Sacramento, California. Then came the Broadway-Crenshaw Center (known today as the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza), which was dedicated, in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles on November 10, 1947 as the first major shopping mall on the West Coast. Three more suburban shopping centers were completed in 1949. Town and Country Drive-In Shopping Center (Town and Country Shopping Center), in Whitehall, Ohio was a strip-type complex erected in the environs of Columbus, Ohio. Park Forest, Illinois' Park Forest Plaza (Park Forest Downtown) was built along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cluster-type complex. It was situated in the southern suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. Cameron Village contained a shopping center {{as part of a}} planned community in what was then the outskirts of Raleigh, NC.|$|E
25|$|Machiavelli {{felt that}} his early {{schooling}} along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditional classical education was essentially useless {{for the purpose}} of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development. Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads to happiness. And Machiavelli viewed misery as one of the vices that enables a prince to rule. Machiavelli stated that {{it would be best to}} be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved. In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime.|$|E
25|$|The Conseil d'État and Palais de la Légion d'Honneur (Hôtel de Salm) were rebuilt {{in their}} {{original}} style. The new Hôtel de Ville was built on <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more picturesque Neo-Renaissance style than the original {{that was based on}} the appearance of the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, with a façade decorated with statues of outstanding personages who contributed to the history and fame of Paris. The destroyed Ministry of Finance on the Rue de Rivoli was replaced by a grand hotel, while the Ministry moved into the Richelieu wing of the Louvre, where it remained until 1989. The ruined Cour des Comptes on the Left Bank was replaced by the Gare d'Orléans, also known under the name Gare d'Orsay, now the Museé d'Orsay. The one difficult decision was the Tuileries Palace, originally built in the 16th century by Marie de' Medici as a royal residence. The interior had been entirely destroyed by fire, but the walls were still largely intact. The walls remained standing for ten years while the fate of the ruins was debated. Baron Haussmann, in retirement, appealed for a restoration of the building as a historic monument, and there was a proposal {{to turn it into a}} new museum of modern art. In 1881, however, a new Chamber of Deputies more sympathetic to the Commune than previous governments decided that it was too much a symbol of the monarchy and had the walls pulled down.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the creatures}} are {{depicted}} in violent interaction. The central figures are a large ichthyosaur biting into the long neck of a plesiosaur. Another plesiosaur is seen trying to surprise a crocodile on the shore, and yet another is using its long neck to seize a pterosaur flying above the water. This emphasis on violent interactions in nature {{was typical of the}} Regency era. De la Beche translated Conybeare's verbal description of marine reptiles into pictorial form. Several of the ichthyosaurs are depicted seizing various fish whose scales and bones had been found in coprolites and a couple are shown excreting the faeces that will become the coprolites of the future. In addition to the vertebrates there were several invertebrates shown including belemnites depicted as squid-like and an ammonite represented as a floating creature along <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paper nautilus. There are also more recognizable empty ammonite shells on the sea bottom, and some stalked crinoids (sea lilies), of which some very finely preserved fossils had been found at Lyme Regis, are depicted in the lower right corner. One of the features of the painting that has most struck historians is the split level view that shows action both above and {{below the surface of the}} water. This is known as an aquarium view, and Duria Antiquior is the first known example; the style would not become common until the Victorian aquarium craze a couple of decades later.|$|E
