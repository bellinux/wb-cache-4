[...] "I Was Here" [...] is the only song on the record that was not co-written by Beyoncé. On June 1, 2011, Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Posts PopWrap that she wrote [...] "the best [...] ever written" [...] {{a week and a}} half ago and that Beyoncé had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4. She described it as [...] "a career song and probably my favorite thing I've ever written". The development of [...] "I Was Here" [...] was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Warren wanted to work with Beyoncé since the Destiny's Child eras, but admitted that [...] "I Was Here" [...] was the ideal timing, [...] "I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing [...] would be Beyoncé. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} generally favourable reviews. Joe Joseph of The Times {{stated that it}} [...] "bears a closer resemblance [...] 24," [...] which [...] "shaded the pleasure of this opening episode", but felt {{that by the end}} of the episode, Spooks had [...] "established a voice of its own." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph thought that the series [...] "proved thoroughly entertaining", and praised Wolstencroft's writing, which O'Donovan felt was [...] "confident enough to be playful with its subject – especially regarding Britain's poor-relation relationship with America." [...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times called the first series [...] "a tremendous pieces of hokum, which is only slightly po-faced (but in a knowing kind of way) and which manages to stay just on the right side of self-parody." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social", and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch straight into an urgent purposive shorthand." ...|$|E
500|$|Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian {{called it}} [...] "one of those shiny and insubtantial series," [...] adding that [...] "all that leaping {{out of bed}} at dawn on the pretext {{that you have to}} go and sell a house tends to wear thin." [...] Banks-Smith also called the story [...] "slightly unexpected." [...] She also stated [...] "Spooks appears to plume itself on its authenticity, and there are moments, well one moment, so stupid it has to be true." [...] Thomas Sudcliff of The Independent felt it was a [...] "different kind of spy drama" [...] with [...] "a literal description, derived from the sort of rueful story you could imagine being told at an MI5 staff social," [...] and [...] "a lot of bullshit too, naturally. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dramas where colleagues never make small talk but instead launch {{straight}} into an urgent purposive shorthand."

[...] Alison Graham of the Radio Times said that after the episode, the series [...] "looks like it's going to be great fun," [...] but [...] "it's presumably not meant to be taken too seriously, because surely life in MI5 can't be this exciting?" ...|$|E

It was {{nominated}} for, and later received, the Best Music at the 1992 Saturn Awards and Best Original Score at the Independent Spirit Awards. In March 2011, British music publication NME placed Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Mes soundtrack at number 1 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Film soundtracks Ever, describing it as [...] "combining plangent beauty {{with a kind of}} clanking evil jazz, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> endlessly evocative soundtracks that takes up residence in your subconscious and never leaves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attorney General Reilly {{certified}} {{the language}} and format of petitions as valid on September 7, 2005. Advocates of same-sex marriage objected that the proposed amendment was clearly designed to reverse the SJC decision, {{a violation of the}} state constitution's rule that amendments could not be used for that purpose. Deval Patrick, Reilly's principal opponent for the Democratic nomination for governor, said [...] "There was a strong argument that this should have gone a different way." [...] Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said: [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> instances where the institution of gay marriage may be less divisive to society than the referendum campaign will be. The emotions that this kind of issue brings out can be very detrimental to society. It {{has been around for a}} year and any honest person can conclude that it has not been detrimental to society." ...|$|E

All the doctrines that put us in the way are sanctified by the atonement; all the spurs to a diligent running in that way are powerful as motives, by our being bought with that precious price, the death of Emmanuel.

Of this the text speaks; and therefore, we may, I hope, think a little of it to-day, but reverently, and cautiously, like men who know a very little, and are afraid of saying more than they know. These deep mysteries about heaven we must always meddle with very humbly, lest we get out of our depth in haste and self- conceit. As it is said, ...|$|E
