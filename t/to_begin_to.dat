5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done.

5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> take responsibility for strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way {{into the center of the}} fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 7/8 April, Petrović ordered Trifunović <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> withdraw, first to a line through the Dravinja river, Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the Krka river. Later in the day this was {{moved back to the}} line of the Kupa river. This ended the {{successful}} defence of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska along the line of the Drava, and meant their withdrawal from Maribor. Disregarding orders from above, Palten exploited their withdrawal by leading his kampfgruppe south towards the town, and crossing the Pesnica river in inflatable boats, leaving his unit vehicles behind. In the evening, Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed, taking 100 prisoners. For disregarding orders, Palten and his kampfgruppe were ordered to return to Spielfeld, and {{spent the rest of the}} invasion guarding the border. In the meantime, the forward elements of the two divisions consolidated their bridgeheads, with the 132nd Infantry Division securing Maribor, and the 183rd Infantry Division pushing past Murska Sobota, reaching Kapelski Vrh.|$|E

5|$|Steps {{had also}} been taken to expand the pre-Federation network of coastal defences to provide {{protection}} against raids from Japanese or German warships prior to World War I. In 1912, these defences were manned by 14 companies of the Australian Garrison Artillery, each of which had a strength of over 100 men. Meanwhile, in September 1912 the government officially approved {{the formation of an}} Australian military air arm. In so doing Australia became the first of the Dominions, {{and one of the few}} nations outside of Europe, <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> develop such a capability, even if it was initially only a modest one. The Central Flying School was established at Point Cook, Victoria in 1913. Flying training did not begin immediately, though, and it was not until 1914, that the first class of pilots were accepted. No. 1 Flight of the Australian Flying Corps was raised in the 3rd Military District on 14 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|The northward {{movement}} {{also sent}} Danielle into somewhat increased shear, which allowed it <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> weaken. However, the weakening was gradual at first as the waters remained fairly warm. The abrupt northerly turn meant that, {{for a while}} on August 17, the Azores were threatened by Danielle in the long-range forecast, as a weakened tropical storm or extratropical cyclone. Danielle weakened to a Category1 hurricane {{on the evening of}} August 17 as shear continued to increase. Danielle began to turn to the northeast early on August 18, and at that point, the weakening trend accelerated. Some of the deep convection was being removed from the system due to wind shear, and that morning, Danielle weakened to a tropical storm. The rapid weakening trend continued that afternoon, and Danielle weakened to a low-end tropical storm with 45mph (75km/h) winds late that evening. However, the intensity levelled off early on August 19 and Danielle remained a tropical storm for the next couple days over moderately warm water of around 78°F (just under 26°C) while south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E

5|$|Jean-François Champollion (Champollion le jeune; 23 December 17904 March 1832) was a French scholar, philologist and orientalist, known {{primarily}} as the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding {{figure in the}} field of Egyptology. A child prodigy in philology, he gave his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in 1806, and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles, and spoke Coptic and Arabic fluently. During the early 19th-century French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1797–1801) which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, {{and the degree to which}} the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or ideographic (recording semantic concepts directly). Many thought that the script was only used for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion's decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> retrieve many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{conversion}} was not immediate, but {{he contacted}} Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant {{as he was}} known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> submit to authority for her sake. He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her {{at the beginning of each}} trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.|$|E
