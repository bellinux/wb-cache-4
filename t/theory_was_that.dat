5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> endozoochory (the enticement {{of animals}} to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, {{in more recent}} circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> word Junee which {{originates}} {{from the}} Aboriginal word 'Jewnee' means [...] "speak to me".Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> an Aboriginal word [...] "Choo-nee" [...] meaning [...] "frog".|$|R
25|$|When {{captured}} by raiders, there <b>are</b> two <b>theories</b> {{as to where}} Patrick <b>was</b> enslaved. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he herded sheep in the countryside around Slemish. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Patrick herded sheep near Killala Bay, {{at a place called}} Fochill.|$|R
50|$|Function {{is under}} question, but one <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they {{migrate to the}} {{periphery}} of the Langerhans cells and release their contents into the extracellular matrix. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Birbeck granule functions in receptor-mediated endocytosis, similar to clathrin-coated pits.|$|R
5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} in diameter, {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it had {{crashed into the}} much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres in diameter, creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although {{it is still possible}} that a different moon may have been involved.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E

30|$|The {{advantage}} of DS <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the evidence can {{be associated with}} multiple possible events, for example, sets of events. One of the most important features of DS <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the model <b>is</b> designed to cope with varying levels of precision regarding the information.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> several <b>theories</b> {{as to how}} {{the term}} [...] "seiyū" [...] <b>was</b> coined. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Oyhashi Tokusaburo, a {{reporter}} for the Yomiuri Newspaper, coined the term. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Tatsu Ooka, an entertainment programming managing producer for the NHK, came up with it.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E
5|$|This was {{originally}} {{interpreted as the}} foundation of the King's Bench, with the Court of Common Pleas not coming into existence until the signing of the Magna Carta. The later <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Henry II's decree created the Court of Common Pleas, not the King's Bench, and that the King's Bench instead split from the Common Pleas at some later time. The first records of an independent King's Bench come from 1234, when distinct plea rolls are found for each court. Modern academics give 1234 as the founding date for the King's Bench as a fully independent tribunal, considering it part of the law reform which took place from 1232 to 1234. Under Edward I, the presence of the King in the court became more and more irregular, and by 1318 the court sat independent of the monarch. Its last travels around the country were in 1414 to Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Shropshire, and a visit to Northamptonshire in 1421. From then onwards, the King's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King. Like the Common Pleas, the King's Bench sat in Westminster Hall until its dissolution.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{retaliation}} was for Sokolich's {{opposition to}} the PA's recent toll hike.|$|E
50|$|A <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the name}} Musa {{comes from the}} Hebrew language. Mu means box while sa is wood. This is because Asiya, Pharaoh's wife, found him {{floating}} in the Nile river in a wooden box. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Musa comes from the Ancient Egyptian word for newborn.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{theories}} {{exist as}} to the etymological origins of the name 'Kinarut'. One such <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it refers to a street in the town which was formerly called China Road. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it originated from the Dusun word Kinorot which means 'cutting using a knife'.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the name}} derives from Kalighat.|$|R
25|$|A further {{implication}} of his <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many stars {{out in the}} universe, with characteristics similar to the Sun, {{would have to be}} expected to possess planetary systems similar to our own.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} were {{advanced to}} explain {{the emergence of the}} new virus. These included increased contact between humans and mice due to a 'bumper crop' in the deer mouse population. Another <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> something within the virus had changed, allowing it to jump to humans. A third <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> nothing had changed, that hantavirus cases had occurred previously, they just had not been properly diagnosed before. This last theory {{turned out to be the}} correct one when it was discovered that the first known case had actually occurred in a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rates}} were set more reasonably, taxpayers would have less {{incentive}} to avoid paying. His <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{by lowering the}} tax rates across the board, he could increase the overall tax revenue. This {{is similar to the}} Laffer curve.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Severe Letter is lost.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> several <b>theories</b> {{behind the}} archaeological sites in Aitaroun. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the village <b>was</b> a pilgrimage site for early Christians {{and for its}} water sources, {{some of which are}} {{believed}} to have been visited by Jesus. This is supported by other archaeological sites in surrounding villages. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the village <b>was</b> an ancient grave yard and an important trade route due to the water sources. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hills surrounding the village had been military outposts for ancient armies. The village is surrounded by rocky hills with narrow valleys as entrances, and this would have made it an easy place to protect from the high ground. Evidence of such outposts also exist on the tops of the surrounding hills. Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the village <b>was</b> part of a Roman olive and vineyard plantation outpost.|$|R
25|$|Fourth, Gaster's own {{favourite}} <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the treasure}} <b>is</b> a hoax.|$|R
25|$|The {{weakness}} of the wave <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt {{in the late nineteenth}} century by the Michelson–Morley experiment.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Porco told {{investigators}} that {{on the night of}} November 14 he had retired to a dormitory lounge to sleep, and awoke the following morning. The police <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he instead drove more than three hours to Albany in early hours of November 15 to attack his parents.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Fifth Circuit heard United States v. Evans, {{an appeal}} of a parole officer's {{conviction}} on mail-fraud charges stemming from falsified travel vouchers she filed to conceal a relationship and bribery scheme with a parolee. The government's <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the vouchers' mailing to state archives in Austin after her supervisor had approved them was {{an essential part of}} the scheme.|$|E
5000|$|There <b>are</b> two <b>theories</b> {{of origin}} {{concerning}} [...] "fetus in fetu". One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mass {{begins as a}} normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its twin. [...] The other <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mass <b>is</b> a highly developed teratoma. [...] "Fetus in fetu" [...] is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{his body}} <b>was</b> {{transferred}} to Llanrumney Hall in Cardiff.|$|R
50|$|One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the river}} eroded the softer layers, causing the landslide.|$|R
25|$|The flourishing and {{industrial}} activity of humankind may affect climate (may contribute anthropogenic effects) in ways not predicted by orbital models. Many studies {{have concluded that}} detectable increases in greenhouse gas in the 20th and 21st centuries would trap energy and result in a warmer climate. A previous <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> industrial particulate pollution of the atmosphere would block solar radiation and result in cooling.|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect was}} {{investigated}} {{as early as}} 1925 by Brillouin. He found that the propagation velocity of acoustic waves would decrease proportional to an applied hydrostatic pressure. However, a consequence of his <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> sound waves would stop propagating at a sufficiently large pressure. This paradoxial effect was later shown {{to be caused by}} the incorrect assumptions that the elastic parameters were not affected by the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Along with collectivization, {{the central}} {{government}} decreed several changes in agricultural techniques based on the ideas of Soviet pseudoscientist Trofim Lysenko. One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> plants {{of the same species}} would not compete with each other. In practice they did, which stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.|$|E
2500|$|By the Barremian (125-129.4 mya), {{there was}} already a pan-Laurasian {{distribution}} of Therizinosaurians. Since Laurasia was beginning to break apart during the Cretaceous, two theories have arisen to explain how therizinosaurians could have spanned across Laurasia. [...] One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> basal therizinosaurians <b>were</b> present on both Asia and North America before it began to drift apart, suggesting an emergence for Therizinosaurians of at least the Late Triassic. However, one obstacle to this <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it contradicts the current emergence date for therizinosaurians, which dates them to the Mid-Jurassic. A second <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the group dispersed between Asia and North America via a European land bridge during the Berriasian-Valanginian.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> IJ {{might have}} arisen from the {{lowercase}} y being {{split into two}} strokes in handwriting. At {{some time in the}} 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ij. An argument against this <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> even in handwriting which does not join letters, ij is often written as a single sign.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Baddeck" [...] is {{believed}} to originate from a Mi'kmaq word. One <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it originates from the word [...] "Abadek" [...] or [...] "Abadak", which means [...] "a portion of food set aside for someone or a sultry place" [...] while another <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it originates from a word meaning [...] "place with an island near".|$|R
