50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba. It went to Alberta for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1929, to British Columbia for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1932, to Atlantic Canada for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1949, and to Saskatchewan for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1950. Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R

Fifteen fire engines and 60 firefighters attended. The Ritz reopened on 6 June 2016 after a major four-year, multimillion-dollar renovation.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps the most crucial period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had finally come to an end.|$|E
5000|$|Fifteen of the 65 female MPs in the 39th Parliament, or 23.4 per cent, {{were elected}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 election. The longest-serving female MPs were the Liberals Albina Guarnieri and Diane Marleau, both elected for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1988 election. (New Democrat Dawn Black was also elected for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> that election; {{defeated}} in the 1993 election, she won her seat back in the 2006 election.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, the Rebels {{defeated}} the McCallum Knights for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> over a decade. [...] "The Bell" [...] {{was awarded to}} Travis, who defended it for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 11 years at the 2011 game.|$|R

5|$|Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226BC {{seeking an}} {{unexpected}} alliance {{now that the}} reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222BC). In exchange for military aid, AntigonusIII demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225BC. In 224BC, AntigonusIII's forces took Arcadia from Sparta. After forming a Hellenic league {{in the same vein}} as PhilipII's League of Corinth, he managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222BC. Sparta was occupied by a foreign power for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor PhilipV.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E
5|$|During its {{six years}} as the Tour DuPont, the race was won by Dutch rider Erik Breukink, Greg LeMond, Raúl Alcalá, Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov, and twice by Lance Armstrong. Over this time, a prologue time trial held in Wilmington, Delaware, became the {{traditional}} start to the race. Between 1992 and 1994, the race included a stage from Port Deposit and Hagerstown in Maryland, but in 1995, South Carolina was included on the route for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> place. Every edition of the Tour DuPont visited Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
50|$|Francis had {{a career}} year while leading the Rockies into the playoffs for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> over a decade. He {{finished}} the season with 17 wins while pitching over 200 innings for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{the issue}} was digitized, and since then the {{transmission}} quality can not be matched with analog equipment.

50|$|In prison, Irene makes {{new friends}} and {{develops}} a thriving social life, taking classes and gaining new skills in a secretarial course.

5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Female {{students}} were {{admitted to the}} college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{returned}} {{as prime minister}} after the 1910 election, which saw Labor attain majority government for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> history. Fisher's second government passed wide-ranging reforms – it established old-age and disability pensions, enshrined new workers' rights in legislation, established the Commonwealth Bank, oversaw the continued expansion of the Royal Australian Navy, began construction on the Trans-Australian Railway, and formally established {{what is now the}} Australian Capital Territory. At the 1913 election, however, Labor narrowly lost its House of Representatives majority to the Liberal Party, with Fisher being replaced as prime minister by Joseph Cook.|$|E
