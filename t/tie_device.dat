40|$|Background: Laparoscopic suturing and tying {{constitute}} advanced {{minimally invasive}} surgery skills. Developing proficiency in the standard methods with needle drivers is often an arduous process. Recent advances in laparoscopic instrumentations has allowed for easier methods of suturing and tying. This study investigated {{the hypothesis that the}} use of a specialized suturing device and a specialized <b>tying</b> <b>device</b> allows inexperienced medical students to suture and tie laparoscopically. Methods: Preclinical medical students who had not received any training in open or laparoscopic surgery were included in this investigation. Each student was given a 5 -minute demonstration of a specialized suturing device and a specialized <b>tying</b> <b>device.</b> The medical students were not allowed to deploy either device before actual use. After the demonstration, each student was given the device to use in a porcine model. Times were recorded and a subjective grade was given for each student. Results: Twenty medical students were involved in this study. All medical students were able to complete the task of suturing and tying. The average time to suture was 104. 6 seconds and the average time to tying was 31. 2 seconds. The average subjective performance grade was 90 (out of 100). Conclusion: Specialized devices are easy to learn and use for laparoscopic suturing and tying with minimal instruction even for inexperienced medical students. Even surgeons who are not well versed in laparoscopic surgery should be able to suture and tie with certain laparoscopic instruments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} {{developed}} a plastic design method for sheathed timber frame shear walls. It has been presented and discussed for inclusion in Eurocode 5 and a Swedish handbook has been presented. In the plastic method, {{you can choose to}} transfer the anchoring force via the leading stud to the substrate, corresponding to a fully anchored shear wall (no uplift of studs), but you can also choose to utilize the sheathings to transfer the tensile force via the sheathing-to-framing joints to the substrate by anchoring the bottom rail, corresponding to a partially anchored shear wall (studs experience uplift). By the plastic method several alternatives for anchoring the wall are possible and they can also be combined {{in such a way that}} each of them take a portion of the uplifting force, e. g. through a simple <b>tying</b> down <b>device,</b> through the sheathing-to-framing joints and through anchoring of the shear wall to the transverse wall. The method also makes it possible to include the load-bearing capacity of wall segments including openings. The handbook treats primarily shear walls, but for the sake of completeness some aspects of the roof and floor diaphragms are also discussed. The interior force distribution in sheathed timber frame walls weak in shear is discussed, as are the fundamental difference between the effect of vertical loads on the stabilisation of walls which are rigid or weak in shear, and how the plastic design method is applied to multi-storey timber buildings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a human-centered {{approach}} to monitoring complex systems which offers the fidelity of methods that compare predictions against observations {{with the emphasis on}} higher-level user feedback found in more inferential techniques. In particular, we cast our work as a decision support tool and we assume that the monitoring system should reason over models that are natural to human users. This has led us to adopt several design tenets: the structure of the model should follow the componential and causal structure of the device; feedback from the system to the user should be <b>tied</b> to the <b>device</b> model; device behaviors should be represented as a set of processes with associated equations; and every process in the model should correspond to some behavior of the device. We claim that these commitments support an intuitive and effective design for a fault detection, isolation, and diagnosis tool. We discuss the knowledge representations, algorithms, and interface capabilities of this system, and we present a scenario of its use that illustrate our claims in the context of monitoring the electric power system on board the International Space Station. We conclude by discussing an evaluation study of the monitoring tool, including its effect on users’ diagnostic strategies. 1...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{takes place}} in a social context, shaping and shaped by discourses. In online {{projects}} such as the Schome Park Programme, these discourses are semiotic practices that make use of writing and other manifestations of digital literacies. Discourses include traceable patterns with linguistic features of distinctive forms and functions. They are also shaped by the affective concerns of those working and playing with them in context. Online, two primary types of learning context have been identified: networks and communities. While networks may offer a wealth of people and resources, communities appear to offer richer learning possi-bilities.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{intelligent}} jobsite {{is becoming}} a reality as applications using sensors and mobile computing devices are being developed and deployed commercially. This creates an opportunity for workers to access data in an ad hoc manner as they move through a site. However, retasking and reuse of sensors in a dynamic setting presents significant challenges including ad hoc identification of sensors in a local environment, generalization of data, {{and the use of}} dynamic information for decision support. To achieve a generalized approach to using local data, we describe an architecture that abstracts functionality into three tiers: a layer for physical communication among devices; a layer for data processing and abstraction; and a top layer for decision support. At each tier, the level of abstraction increases, allowing for development of decision support applications at the top level that are not directly <b>tied</b> to specific <b>devices.</b> The industry vision for the intelligent jobsite is driving considerable research and development in mobile technologies. However, the bulk of this development is application specific and directly ties hardware (e. g., RFID tags, sensors) to data processing applications. We seek to decouple sensors from computing hardware and application development by providing a flexible and robust middleware. Realization of the middleware will enable more flexible reuse of data to make it available to a range of decision support applications, {{while at the same time}} speeding development of suc...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Contemporary {{circuit design}} {{involves}} significant computer-based simulation, {{calling for a}} balance between circuit model accuracy and simulation run time. Traditionally, circuit modelers concentrated on producing either (1) physically-based models, where each element in the model correlates to a physically meaningful aspect of the device being modeled or (2) mathematically-based "macromodels," designed to be efficient to simulate without <b>ties</b> to the <b>device's</b> physical underpinnings. While each approach has significant value, the strengths of one are often the weaknesses of the other. This work presents CAM, the Circuit Augmentation Method, that integrates {{some of the best}} aspects of each approach. Based on the assumption that high-accuracy, multi-port simulation or measurement data for the device under consideration is available, the methodology augments an existing, user-provided equivalent circuit model that is reasonably accurate over some frequency band with discrepancies elsewhere. Macromodels using rational functions are derived via standard least-squares or vector fittings approaches and are logically "added" to the user model creating a result that is potentially both fast to simulate yet still physically meaningful. An important aspect of CAM is its perturbational nature: It is shown that perturbation of the user model's component values (or similar attributes) is necessary for optimal results. CAM is a general-purpose technique that is applicable to the often difficult problems of modeling circuits requiring wideband accuracy or those incorporating highly-distributed structures. This utility is demonstrated over several two-port examples, including a broadband oscilloscope probe tip, a spiral inductor on a lossy silicon substrate, and a highly-distributed and lossy test circuit...|$|R
