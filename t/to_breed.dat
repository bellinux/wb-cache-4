5|$|Capybaras are {{hunted for}} their meat and pelts in some areas, and {{otherwise}} killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock.

40|$|Reliable {{methods for}} tracing animal {{products}} <b>to</b> <b>breeds</b> or their {{region of origin}} would allow a certification of regional products. This would contribute to consumers confidence and to the exploitation of local genetic resources in marginal rural areas. Different methods can be envisaged to assign individuals <b>to</b> <b>breeds</b> or populations exploiting molecular information. Among these, the estimation of genetic distances between individuals followed by the depiction of the results by multivariate methods is frequently used. However, representation of genetic relationships in a tree or multidimensional plots, depends on the choice of distance measure and graphical representation, and rarely leads to clusters that correspond <b>to</b> <b>breeds.</b> In addition, bifurcating tree topologies suppose a strictly hierarchical population history [...] . ...|$|R

5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations <b>to</b> <b>breed.</b> Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{management}} work {{carried out in the}} nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks <b>to</b> <b>breed,</b> and small numbers of tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common pochard (Aythya ferina), common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti).|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, {{not the least of}} which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> away from the natal site.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} breed is rather {{questionable}} and it’s used {{more as a}} tool for “labelling” production systems than as a biological category. Here, production system is intended as a whole set of animal units, techniques, breeding schemes, marketing, etc. However, man has demonstrated to be very quick in capturing and disseminating good characteristics whence they appear in a breed by mutation or by selection. Therefore, it might be expected that breeds, nevertheless of recent origin, could bear distinguished productive characteristics. Due to the quan- titative nature of them, more characteristics should be measured in order to obtain a clear and statistically significant distinction. We have measured several meat characteristics in 15 European breeds (30 individuals for each breed), mostly with beef attitude, reared in similar conditions. This was accomplished to better reveal the genetic background of breeds. A canonical discriminant analysis showed a clear distinction among breeds. In particular lipid composition of meat was able to assign individuals <b>to</b> <b>breeds</b> with 57 % and 63 % of individuals correctly classified respectively for neutral and phospholipids. The classification is generally good for all breeds except for the Spanish ones,indicating probably some crossing in the past for these breeds. Neutral lipids can classify double muscled breeds with high precision (84 % and 95 % in Asturiana de los Valles and Piedmontese respectively). Tenderness related measures (collagen, µ-calpain, m-calpain, calpastatin, MFI) poorly assign indi- viduals <b>to</b> <b>breeds</b> (average 22 %). The good classification of individuals <b>to</b> <b>breeds</b> for lipid composition suggests distinctive genetic features and encourages to look further to genetic determination of fat composition in the meat, as well as <b>to</b> exploit particular <b>breeds</b> <b>to</b> obtain products suitable for categories of consumers needing/searching for special components in their diet...|$|R
