5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} ferric chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
25|$|A pigment is a {{material}} {{that changes the}} color of reflected or <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> {{as the result of}} wavelength-selective absorption. This physical process differs from fluorescence, phosphorescence, and other forms of luminescence, in which {{a material}} emits light.|$|E
25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in <b>transmitted</b> <b>light.</b> Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E

25|$|Organic palynofacies {{considers}} all {{the acid}} insoluble {{particulate organic matter}} (POM), including kerogen and palynomorphs in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using strew mounts on microscope slides that may be examined using a <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> biological microscope or ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects can also {{occur at the}} (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle. When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can produce polarization in the reflected and <b>transmitted</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{refractive}} index of fibers varies slightly with {{the frequency of}} light, and light sources are not perfectly monochromatic. Modulation of the light source to transmit a signal also slightly widens the frequency band of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>light.</b> This has the effect that, over long distances and at high modulation speeds, the different frequencies of light can take different times {{to arrive at the}} receiver, ultimately making the signal impossible to discern, and requiring extra repeaters. This problem can be overcome in a number of ways, including the use of a relatively short length of fiber that has the opposite {{refractive index}} gradient.|$|E
5000|$|Black films prevent weed growth, {{but do not}} <b>transmit</b> <b>light</b> to heat up the soil; clear films <b>transmit</b> <b>light</b> {{and heat}} the soil, but promote weed growth. Photosensitive films have been {{developed}} that are pigmented to prevent weed growth, but still <b>transmit</b> <b>light</b> to heat the soil. These photosensitive films are more costly than either the clear or black polyethylene sheeting. In a study using okra, the total yield of the okra and fruit number was two times more when using plastic mulching than without mulching. They found that black plastic mulch controls evaporation from the soil, improves soil water retention. Plastic mulching proved to reduce irrigation requirements in pepper by 14-29% because of elimination of soil evaporation.|$|R

25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{infrared}} spectrum {{of a sample}} is recorded by passing a beam of infrared light through the sample. When {{the frequency of the}} IR {{is the same as the}} vibrational frequency of a bond or collection of bonds, absorption occurs. Examination of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> reveals how much energy was absorbed at each frequency (or wavelength). This measurement can be achieved by scanning the wavelength range using a monochromator. Alternatively, the entire wavelength range is measured [...] using a Fourier transform instrument and then a transmittance or absorbance spectrum is generated using a dedicated procedure.|$|E
2500|$|One medieval {{source in}} Iceland, [...] "Rauðúlfs þáttr", {{mentions}} the sunstone as a mineral {{by means of}} which the sun could be located in an overcast and snowy sky by holding it up and noting where it emitted, reflected or <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> (hvar geislaði úr honum). Sunstones are also mentioned in Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar (13th century) and in church and monastic inventories (14th–15th century) without discussing their attributes. The sunstone texts of Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar were copied to all four versions of the medieval hagiography Guðmundar saga góða.|$|E
2500|$|One-way mirrors [...] (also called two-way mirrors) work by {{overwhelming}} dim <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> {{with bright}} reflected light. A true one-way mirror that actually allows light to be transmitted {{in one direction}} only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the second law of thermodynamics: if one placed a cold object on the transmitting side and a hot one on the blocked side, radiant energy would be transferred from the cold to the hot object. Thus, though a one-way mirror {{can be made to}} appear to work in only one direction at a time, it is actually reflective from either side.|$|E
30|$|Color filters {{selectively}} reflect or <b>transmit</b> <b>light</b> of {{a target}} wavelength. A unit (pixel) in an array transmits dominantly one color (e.g., red, green, or blue). Each pixel delivers different color information, and a combination of colored pixels can produce a specific image. A structural color filter has a nano-scale structure that interacts with incident light to reflect or <b>transmit</b> <b>light</b> of a specific wavelength. PCFs that exploit plasmonic resonance are promising candidates to replace conventional pigment- or dye-based color filters. We will review research on PCFs sorted by structure.|$|R

2500|$|In 1995 Maytag {{introduced}} an [...] "intelligent" [...] dishwasher {{based on a}} fuzzy controller and a [...] "one-stop sensing module" [...] that combines a thermistor, for temperature measurement; a conductivity sensor, to measure detergent level from the ions present in the wash; a turbidity sensor that measures scattered and <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> to measure the soiling of the wash; and a magnetostrictive sensor to read spin rate. The system determines the optimum wash cycle for any load to obtain the best results with {{the least amount of}} energy, detergent, and water. It even adjusts for dried-on foods by tracking the last time the door was opened, and estimates the number of dishes by the number of times the door was opened.|$|E
2500|$|Bottom or top emission: Bottom or top {{distinction}} refers not to {{orientation of}} the OLED display, but to the direction that emitted light exits the device. [...] OLED devices are classified as bottom emission devices if light emitted passes through the transparent or semi-transparent bottom electrode and substrate on which the panel was manufactured. [...] Top emission devices are classified based {{on whether or not}} the light emitted from the OLED device exits through the lid that is added following fabrication of the device. [...] Top-emitting OLEDs are better suited for active-matrix applications as they can be more easily integrated with a non-transparent transistor backplane. [...] The TFT array attached to the bottom substrate on which AMOLEDs are manufactured are typically non-transparent, resulting in considerable blockage of <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> if the device followed a bottom emitting scheme.|$|E
2500|$|Coal-tar {{creosote}} is greenish-brown liquid, {{with different}} degrees of darkness, viscosity, and fluorescence depending on how it's made. When freshly made, the creosote is a yellow oil with a greenish cast and highly fluorescent; the fluorescence increased by exposure to air and light. After settling, the oil is dark green by reflected light and dark red by <b>transmitted</b> <b>light.</b> To the naked eye, it will generally appear brown. The creosote (often called [...] "creosote oil") consists almost wholly of aromatic hydrocarbons, with some amount of bases and acids and other neutral oils. The flash point is 7075°C and burning point is 90100°C, and when burned it releases a greenish smoke. The smell largely depends on the naptha content in the creosote; {{if there is a}} high amount, it will have a naptha-like smell; otherwise it will smell more of tar.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2010 Professor Timothy Jull, {{a member}} of the {{original}} 1988 radiocarbon-dating team and editor of the peer-reviewed journal Radiocarbon, coauthored an article in that journal with Rachel A Freer-Waters. They examined a portion of the radiocarbon sample that was left over from the section used by the University of Arizona in 1988 for the carbon dating exercise, and were assisted by the director of the Gloria F Ross Center for Tapestry Studies. They viewed the fragment using a low magnification (~30×) stereomicroscope, as well as under high magnification (320×) viewed through both <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> and polarized light, and then with epifluorescence microscopy. They found [...] "only low levels of contamination by a few cotton fibers" [...] and no evidence that the samples actually used for measurements in the C14 dating processes were dyed, treated, or otherwise manipulated. They concluded that the radiocarbon dating had been performed on a sample of the original shroud material.|$|E
2500|$|At room temperature, {{most of the}} {{molecules}} {{will be in the}} lowest energy state, which is known as the ground state. [...] A few molecules will be in higher energy states, which are known as excited states. [...] The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution. [...] Performing such a calculation shows that, for relatively low temperatures (such as those used for most routine spectroscopy), most of {{the molecules}} occupy the ground vibrational state. [...] Such a molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. [...] This is the mechanism by which IR spectroscopy operates: [...] infrared radiation is passed through the sample, and the intensity of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> is compared with that of the incident light.

2500|$|To a {{conventionally}} composed Roman glass flux 330 {{parts per}} million of silver and 40 of gold were added: [...] "These particles were precipitated as colloids and form a silver-gold alloy. [...] When viewed in reflected light the minute metallic particles are just coarse enough to reflect enough of the light without eliminating the transmission. [...] In <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> the fine particles scatter the blue {{end of the spectrum}} more effectively than the red end, resulting in red transmission, and this is the colour observed. [...] Since it is impossible that the Roman artisans managed to add these incredibly low levels of silver and gold to the volume of the glass used to make the vessel deliberately, the levels were probably added at higher levels to a larger volume of glass-melt, and increasingly diluted by adding more glass." [...] The particles are only about 70 nanometers across, and embedded in the glass, so they cannot be seen by optical microscopy, and a transmission electron microscope is needed instead. [...] At this size they approach the size of the wavelengths of visible light, and a surface plasmon resonance effect takes place.|$|E
