5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminary}} matter is introduced by an iconic {{image of the}} Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.|$|E

5|$|According to the Ananda Ramayana, king Padmaksha had a {{daughter}} named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom. Ravana buries the box {{in the city of}} Janaka, who discovers Padma and brings her up as Sita.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E

25|$|During a site {{review on}} January 7, 2000, Park System workers raised <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the stone coffin of Benjamin Romaine.

25|$|Investigators {{from the}} Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the British Department for Transport {{concluded}} that {{the nose of the}} aircraft was effectively blown off, and was separated from the main section within three seconds of the explosion.

25|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the Mucorales, Apophysomyces species often fail to sporulate under {{standard}} clinical laboratory culture conditions. These fungi require Czapek's agar (CZA), a nutrient-defined medium. Colonies grow rapidly at 37°C on CZA and initially appear white and woolly becoming greyish brown with age. Colonies are grey and floccose, will grow on <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the petri dish, and are colourless on reverse. Sporangiosphores are unbranched, smooth-walled, and light brown. Sporangia are apophyseal, pyriform, beginning as whitish and turning brown with maturity. Sporangiospores are variable in size and shape. Sexuality has not been observed in A. variabilis.|$|E

25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|E
25|$|After the Dissolution of the monasteries at the English Reformation, the retable {{panel was}} made into <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> a chest, with the main painted side facing down. The chest was used to store wax funeral effigies of English monarchs, and the {{painting}} was not rediscovered until 1725, when it was drawn by Vertue (British Library). In 1778 serious damage was caused when the chest was modified into a cupboard or display case to show the funeral effigy of Pitt the Elder. Not until 1827, when the Retable was seen by the architect Edward Blore, then Surveyor of the Abbey, published in The Gentleman's Magazine and removed from the chest and set in a glazed frame, was it regarded {{as anything other than}} a curiosity by the Abbey. Since its rediscovery, the piece has been further damaged by attempted restoration efforts, which included a coating of glue intended to hold together painted layers. Watercolours of the Retable were made for the Society of Antiquaries of London; a conjectural restoration was included in Viollet-le-Duc's Dictionnaire raisonné du mobilier français, and plates accompanied William Burges's essays on painted objects at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
