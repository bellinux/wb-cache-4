500|$|The name Aspirin {{was derived}} from the name of the {{chemical}} ASA—Acetylspirsäure in German. Spirsäure (salicylic acid) was named for the meadowsweet plant, Spirea ulmaria, from which it could be derived. Aspirin took a- for the acetylation, -spir- from Spirsäure, and added -in as a typical drug name ending to make it easy <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to Aspirin and Euspirin; Aspirin, they feared, might remind customers of aspiration, but Arthur Eichengrün argued that Eu- (meaning [...] "good") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on Aspirin.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{was still}} {{interested}} in Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian in early 1991. Impressed with Daniel Waters' work on Heathers, Burton approached {{him for a}} rewrite. However, he eventually signed Waters to write the script for Batman Returns. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite. Warner Bros. approached Kevin Smith in 1996 to rewrite the script, though Smith turned down the offer in favor of Superman Lives. Smith later joked that his response was [...] "Didn't we say all we needed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first Beetlejuice? Must we go tropical?" [...] In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying [...] "The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made.

[...] It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced, and not handed in until the second day, just previous to its conclusion.|$|E
500|$|An {{extensive}} {{account of}} the controversy around the book was published {{at the same time}} as the new edition, largely supporting Wilson's views. Looking back at Sociobiology 35 years later, the philosopher of biology Michael Ruse called the book [...] "a pretty remarkable achievement" [...] of huge scope, [...] "firmly in the Darwinian paradigm of evolution through natural selection". He found one aspect of the book [...] "very peculiar" [...] in its [...] "metaphysical underpinning", namely that Wilson was committed to the idea of progress in biology, [...] "the idea that organic life has proceeded from the very simple to the very complex, from the value-free to the value-laden, from (as they used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century) the monad to the man." [...] Ruse observed that while producing humans might look like progress, evolution had [...] "also produced smallpox and syphilis and potato blight," [...] raising [...] "serious doubts about whether evolution is progressive." [...] Ruse noted that Gould's 1989 book Wonderful Life was entirely an attack on this idea of progress.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} of Boden {{professor at the}} University of Oxford was established by the bequest of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden of the Bombay Native Infantry, who died in 1811. His will provided that {{on the death of}} his daughter (which occurred in 1827), his estate should pass to the university to fund a Sanskrit professorship. His purpose was to convert the people of India to Christianity [...] "by disseminating a knowledge of the Sacred scriptures among them". The university statutes governing the chair provided that the professor should be chosen by the members of Convocation– all those who had obtained the Oxford degree of Master of Arts, whether or not they taught in the university– rather than by the professors and college fellows. At the time of the 1860 election, there were 3,786members of Convocation. According to the religious historian Gwilym Beckerlegge, the professorship was regarded at the time as [...] "prestigious and handsomely remunerated". An editorial in the British national newspaper The Times in 1860 said that the professorship was [...] "one of the most important, most influential, and most widely known institutions at Oxford, not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole civilised world." [...] It paid between £900 and £1,000 per year for life.|$|E
500|$|In late 1967, the WCPAEB {{released}} {{their third}} album, Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), {{which was the}} band's most ambitious, albeit less consistent than its predecessor, work to date. The album featured a peculiar cover photo of Markley and the Harris brothers sitting bare-chested in a silver bathroom, and a bold declaration on the backside: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything we wanted <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way we wanted to say it". For the first time, each track was credited either {{in whole or in}} part to members of the WCPAEB; however, Markley's manic narratives and questionable lyrical content (particularly young girls) dominate the record. An edited version of the Morgan-Markley composition [...] "Smell of Incense" [...] was issued just ahead of Vol. 2 (Breaking Through), but it failed to chart. The Dallas psychedelic pop group Southwest FOB covered the song in 1968, which reached No.56 on the Billboard Hot 100. Among its ten tracks, the album included the politically-satirical [...] "In the Arena", possibly inspired by the Watts riots. Vol. 2 (Breaking Through) also features the anti-war song [...] "Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes", the full version of [...] "Smell of Incense", and a rare instance of Markley singing is found on [...] "Unfree Child".|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that someone {{was going to try to}} kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interview.|$|E
