O sistema apresentou excelente eficiência principalmente na remoção de DQOtotal de 60 % (&# 963 = ± 30 %) e DQOdissolvida 60 % (&# 963 = ± 13 %). De início a remoção de coliformes foi total - o que pode evidenciar o efeito tóxico da serragem, devido à grande presença de cromo na serragem; no entanto, exames posteriores detectaram a existência de coliformes nos efluentes de todos os filtros levantando uma dúvida a respeito da toxicidade da serragem. Ainda que se conheçam inúmeras formas de tratamento de efluentes líquidos, a proposta de usar serragem de couro - que é gerada em curtumes em grande quantidade - como meio suporte em filtros percoladores pode significar um passo para que se encontre solução conjunta tanto para a serragem - resíduo indesejável - como para o pós-tratamento de esgoto sanitário.

To investigate the possible biological action and that of the material efficiency some actions were taken: performance evaluation of the percolators filters in the sanitary sewage post treatment, using as a support means the sawing of that type, generated in a <b>tanning</b> <b>plant</b> - this is one way of solving the problem of sanitary sewage post treatment, as well as, to attenuate the toxic effects of the type wet blue leather sawing; the evaluation and monitoring of indicator parameters that turn to a possible simple control on the process - such as BOD 5, COD, NTK and amoniacal nitrogen; to investigate the percolator filter efficiency in the reduction of fecal coliform population that are present in the sanitary sewage. The system presented an excellent efficiency, mainly in the removal of CODtotal 60 % (&# 963 = ± 30 %) and CODdissolved 60 % (&# 963 = ± 13 %). In the beginning the coliform removal was total - what could have been caused by the sawing toxic effect, due to substancial amounts of chromium in the sawing; however, later analysis detected the existence of coliforms in the effluents of all filters originating a questionable subject about the sawing toxicity.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of sorghum genotypes with a {{pigmented}} pericarp were grown in varying environments and were analyzed for total phenols, condensed tannins, flavan- 4 -ols, and in vitro antioxidant activity. In addition, sorghum flavonoids were separated, characterized, and quantified using HPLC-PDA and LC-MS. Total phenols and in vitro antioxidant activity increased when sorghums had a pigmented testa causing the presence of condensed tannins. Flavan- 4 -ol levels were highest in sorghums with a black pericarp (5. 8 - 16. 1 abs/mL/g), followed by those with a red pericarp (1. 1 - 9. 2 abs/mL/g). Sorghums with a black pericarp had the highest 3 -deoxyanthocyanin levels (308 - 1885 ?g/g) and these were increased when the grain had minimal weathering and was darkest in color. Sorghums with a lemon-yellow pericarp had the highest flavanone levels (260 - 3586 ?g/g) with eriodictyol being the main flavanone. Flavanone levels were increased when the grain was bright yellow with minimum weathering and were high compared {{to those found in}} common sources (238 - 574 ?g/g, fresh wts.).

This is an example of international agricultural research output aimed at improving productivity in developing countries also having spillover benefits in developed countries. The spillover impacts in Australia from genetic materials developed and dis-tributed through ICRISAT were analyzed in two levels. The first level is the identification of anticipated spillover benefits in terms of cost reduction for sorghum. The second level is the incorporation of price effects of international agricultural research for this crop. The price effects resulting from successful ICRISAT research were found to be significant. The lower prices for sor- ghum, as a result of increased production led to income reductions for Australian producers, and these were partly offset by the increased yields. The gains for the Australian consumers of these grains (ie, the Australian livestock sector) from the lower prices were significant, so that overall Australia made net gains from the impact of ICRISAT’s sorghum research.

40|$|Lysine {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} nutritional problem {{faced by}} poor {{people living in the}} arid and semi-arid tropics who depend on sorghum as their staple food. This is because of poor lysine content and digestibility of sorghum proteins, which aggravates when sorghum is cooked in food. To address this nutritional problem, compositing with locally available lysine-rich legumes has been proposed. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of compositing with the African grain legume, cowpea, on the protein and functional quality of important traditional African sorghum foods. Two sorghum cultivars, a red, tannin (NS 5511) and a white <b>tan</b> <b>plant,</b> non-tannin (Orbit) composited with cowpea at 70 : 30 ratio, were used to prepare three traditional sorghum foods, ugali (unfermented thick porridge), uji (fermented thin porridge) and injera (fermented flatbread). The protein quality of the traditional sorghum foods was determined by measuring their protein contents, lysine and reactive lysine contents, and in vitro protein digestibility. The functional properties of the foods were studied using instrumental texture analysis. Other sensory properties of ugali were determined using a trained sensory panel. Compositing with cowpea increased the protein contents of the foods by up to 35 % and 57 % for NS 5511 and Orbit foods, respectively. Lysine contents of the food proteins increased by 67 % to 139 %. Reactive lysine content increased by 10 % to 75 %. Protein digestibility of the foods increased by 13 % to 62 %. There was approximately three- and two-fold increase in protein digestibility corrected amino score (PDCAAS) of NS 5511 and Orbit foods, respectively, due to addition of cowpea. However, Orbit-plus-cowpea foods still had better protein quality than NS 5511 -plus-cowpea foods, primarily because of the tannins in the latter which bind the proteins thereby lowering their digestibility. Compositing reduced paste peak viscosity (PV) and cool paste viscosity (CPV) of uji porridge by 6 % to 23 %, and 6 % to 12 %, respectively, probably as a result of decreasing porridge starch content. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that compositing contributed 38 % of the variation in 17 sensory attributes of ugali. Compositing imparted cowpea flavour to ugali. Most of the variation in sensory properties (59 %) of ugali was due to the quality characteristics of the sorghum cultivars. Compositing increased the stiffness of NS 5511 injera by up to 25 %, while it reduced the stiffness of Orbit injera by up to 12 %. These differences in stiffness suggested a weakening effect of weaker H-bonding between tannins and other food polymers such as proteins instead of stronger covalent bonds like those involved in proteins-protein interactions. Compositing important traditional sorghum foods with cowpea has potential for helping to solve lysine deficiency faced by sorghum consumers in the semi-arid tropics. However, it introduces cowpea flavour which may need to be eliminated, in foods intended for consumers not accustomed to cowpea flavour.

In this issue, Hardeland (2015) reviews, mainly from an evolutionary point of view, the occurrence and functions of melatonin in phototrophs, and the place that melatonin deserves in the network of phytohormones. Melatonin not only regulates the germination, growth, and reproduction of <b>plants</b> (<b>Tan</b> et al., 2012), but also promotes the ripening of fruit. Sun et al. (2015) report that melatonin upregulates the expression of ethylene signal transduction-related genes and enhances ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signalling, thereby promoting postharvest ripening and improve-ment of the quality of tomato fruit. Most importantly, melatonin is an essential molecule for protecting plants from abioti...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench] is {{the second}} major cereal crop in Southern Africa after maize. Despite its {{importance}} as a cereal crop it is underutilised in Southern Africa because of insufficient characterisation and development of end-use quality evaluation methods for available cultivars, and the unattractive colour of some products from sorghum. This research aimed at developing simple methodologies for determination of important parameters of sorghum end-use quality, namely kernel hardness and kernel colour. The current research also set out to determine the cause for darkening of porridges made from white tan-plant sorghums and how this may relate to polyphenol oxidase activity. Sixteen Zambian sorghum cultivars grown during the 2008 and 2009 seasons of predominantly medium size, and ranging in colour from white to brown and red, {{with or without a}} pigmented testa were used. Endosperm texture of the sorghums determined by visual endosperm examination ranged from soft to hard. Abrasive hardness index values ranged from 6. 28 to 19. 64 and percentage water absorption ranged from 8. 43 to 26. 56 %. Percent water absorption was significantly and positively correlated (r= 0. 85, p < 0. 001) with endosperm texture and negatively correlated with abrasive hardness index (r=- 0. 89, p< 0. 01). The percent water absorption method could separate soft grains from hard grains just as well as endosperm texture and abrasive hardness index. The simplicity of the percent water absorption method makes it potentially usable by farmers and traders in remote areas where it can contribute to meaningful end-use quality assessment. The relatively dark colour of food products from white tan-plant (food-grade) sorghums can compromise their acceptability. The relationship between white tan-plant sorghum polyphenol oxidase activity (PPO) and porridge colour was investigated. Sorghums (including 28 white tan-plant samples grown in Zambia over two seasons), wheat and white maize were studied. Sorghum grain was intermediate in PPO between wheat and maize. When white <b>tan</b> <b>plant</b> sorghum and maize flours were cooked into porridges, they became darker with lower L* values. More importantly, the transition from white tan-plant sorghum flour to porridge caused a much larger reduction in mean L* value (27. 9) than that with white maize (16. 9). There were significantly negative correlations between all white tan-plant sorghum PPO activity and porridge L* values (r = - 0. 657, p < 0. 01) and between Zambian white tan-plant sorghum PPO activity and porridge L* values (r = - 0. 710, p < 0. 001). It is apparent that PPO activity in white tan-plant sorghums is an important determinant of the relatively dark colour of food products made from them, {{as is the case in}} wheat. Grain colour is an important quality indicator in sorghum-based foods and rural sorghum farmers in sub-Saharan Africa need simple, more accessible methods for its determination. The development of a simple quantitative method for sorghum grain colour assessment by analysis of the grains and their sodium hydroxide (NaOH) extracts was studied. Sixteen Zambian sorghums (white, red and brown types which were either tannin or non-tannin) from the 2008 and 2009 seasons and a Sudanese white tannin sorghum type were assessed for surface colour using Tristimulus colorimetry before and after treatment with NaOH. The NaOH extracts were also analysed using UV-visible spectrophotometry and reverse phase HPLC. Tristimulus colorimetry of the grain surface was able to distinguish white from coloured sorghums (brown and red) but was unable to separate tannin from non-tannin sorghum. UV-visible spectrophotometry and reverse phase HPLC of NaOH extracts from a representative set of the grains consisting of five sorghum types (red tannin, brown tannin, white tannin, red non-tannin and white non-tannin) separated the tannin from non-tannin sorghums regardless of grain surface colour. However, UV-visible absorption of NaOH extracts from the sorghum grains could not be related to grain surface colour as determined using Tristimulus colorimetry. Eleven phenolic compounds consisting of two flavan- 3 -ols, five anthocyanins and four 3 -deoxyanthocyanins were identified in the NaOH extracts using UPLC/PDA/MS. NaOH extract from Framida *SDS[3845] 23 - 2 - 1 (red tannin) contained all of the eleven compounds identified. The flavan- 3 -ols (catechin and +-catechin- 3 -O-gallate) were present in NaOH extracts of all the five sorghums. While some anthocyanins could be identified in NaOH extracts from all five sorghums, only Framida *SDS[3845] 23 - 2 - 1 (red tannin), Sima (white non-tannin) and MMSH 625 (red non-tannin) contained any 3 -deoxyanthocyanins. Total peak area due to anthocyanins and 3 -deoxyanthocyanins was higher for NaOH extracts from tannin sorghums compared to non-tannin. This was in agreement with the UV-visible spectrophotometry of the NaOH extracts which also separated the tannin from non-tannin sorghums. This shows that with NaOH treatment, it is possible to separate tannin from non-tannin sorghums. Colorimetry of NaOH extracts from sorghum may therefore be considered as a potentially simple and cheap alternative method for distinguishing tannin from non-tannin sorghums. The findings of this research provide a platform for the development of a system which promotes an integrated and inclusive approach in using the methodologies developed for sorghum end-use quality evaluation. The methodologies will form an integral part of the system which can be applied along the sorghum value chain in sub-Saharan Africa and involve various stakeholders such as the gene bank, sorghum breeders, cereal scientists and researchers, sorghum food processors, traders, rural farmers and consumers. The efficient application of this system could lead to increased sorghum production and utilisation and contribute significantly to food and nutrition security.

40|$|BACKGROUND Techniques for {{treating}} complex proximal humeral fractures vary and include fixations using tension bands, percutaneous pins, bone suture, T-plates, intramedullary nails, double tubular plates, hemiarthroplasty, <b>plant</b> <b>tan</b> humerus fixator plates, Polaris nails and blade plates. Complications {{of these techniques}} include cutout or {{back out of the}} screws and plates, avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion, nail migration, rotator cuff impairment and impingement syndromes. Insufficient anchorage from conventional implants may lead to early loosening and failure, especially in osteoporotic bones. In general, nonoperative treatment of displaced three and four-part fractures of the proximal humerus leads to poor outcome due to intraarticular nature of injury and inherent instability of the fragments. Comminuted fractures of the proximal humerus are at risk of fixation failure, screw loosening and fracture displacement. Open reduction and internal fixation with conventional plate and screws has been associated with unacceptably high incidence of screw pull out. PHILOS (the proximal humeral internal locking system) plate is an internal fixation system that enables angled stabilisation with multiple interlocking screws for fractures of the proximal humerus. MATERIALS AND METHODS 30 patients with proximal humerus fractures who were admitted in the Department of Orthopaedics, Government General Hospital, Kakinada, during the period November 2014 - November 2016 were taken up for study according to inclusion criteria. All patients were treated with PHILOS plate. These proximal humerus fractures were classified according to Neer’s classification. Patients were followed up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months’ interval. Functional outcomes for pain, range of motion and muscle power and function were assessed using the Constant-Murley scoring system. Collected data analysed with independent t-test and ANNOVA test. RESULTS The outcome of the study was 1 case (3. 33...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{root and}} soil {{respiration}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in agricultural and ecological research, {{but there is little}} understanding how soil texture and water content may affect these estimates. We examined the effects of soil texture on (i) estimated rates of root and soil respiration and (ii) soil CO 2 concentrations, during cycles of soil wetting and drying in the citrus rootstock, Volkamer lemon (Citrus volkameriana <b>Tan.</b> and Pasq.). <b>Plants</b> were grown in soil columns filled with three different soil mixtures varying in their sand, silt and clay content. Root and soil respiration rates, soil water content, plant water uptake and soil CO 2 concentrations were measured and dynamic relationships among these variables were developed for each soil texture treatment. We found that although the different soil textures differed in their plant-soil water relations characteristics, plant growth was only slightly affected. Root and soil respiration rates were similar under most soil moisture conditions for soils varying widely in percentages of sand, silt and clay. Only following irrigation did CO 2 efflux from the soil surface vary among soils. That is, efflux of CO 2 from the soil surface was much more restricted after watering (therefore rendering any respiration measurements inaccurate) in finer textured soils than in sandy soils because of reduced porosity in the finer textured soils. Accordingly, CO 2 reached and maintained the highest concentrations in finer textured soils (> 40 mmol CO 2 mol(- 1)). This study revealed that changes in soil moisture can affect interpretations of root and soil measurements based on CO 2 efflux, particularly in fine textured soils. The implications of the present findings for field soil CO 2 flux measurements are discussed.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} have documented {{the presence of}} plant growth regulators such as auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins of microbial origin (Krishnamoorthy and Vajranabhiah 1986; Grappelli et al. 1987; Tomati et al. 1988; Muscolo et al. 1999) and humic acids (Senesi et al. X 1992; Masciandaro et al. 1997; Atiyeh et al. 2002) in vermicompost in appreciable quantities. Cytokinins produced by Bacillus and Arthrobacter spp. in soils increase the vigour of seedlings (Inbal and Feldman 1982; Jagnow 1987). Microbially produced gibberellins influence plant growth and development (Mahmoud et al. 1984; Arshad and Frankenberger 1993) and auxins produced by Azospirillum brasilense affects the growth of plants belonging to paoceae (Barbieri et al. 1988). Extensive investigations on the biological activities of humic substances showed that they also posses plant growth stimulating property (Chen and Aviad 1990). Humic substances increased the dry matter yields of corn and oat seedlings (Lee and Bartlett 1976; Albuzio et al. 1994); number and length of tobacco roots (Mylonas and Mccants 1980); dry weights of roots, shoots and number of nodules of groundnut, soyabean and clover <b>plants</b> (<b>Tan</b> and Tantiwiramanond 1983) and vegetative growth of chicory plants (Valdrighi et al. 1996) and induced root and shoot formation in plant tissue culture (Goenadi and Sudharama 1995). High levels of humus have been reported from vermicomposts originating from food wastes, animal manure, sewage and paper mill sludges (Atiyeh et al. 2002; Canellas et al. 2002; Arancon et al. 2003 c). The humic and fulvic acid in the humus dissolves insoluble minerals in the organic matter and makes them readily available to plants and in addition they also help plants to overcome stress and stimulates plant growth (Sinha et al. 2010). Studies on biological activities of vermicompost derived humic substances, revealed that they had similar growth-promoting hormonal effect (Dell'Agnola and Nardi 1987; Nardi et al. 1988; Muscolo et al. 1993). The humic materials extracted from vermicomposts {{have been reported to}} produce auxin-like cell growth and nitrate metabolism in carrots (Daucus carota) (Muscolo et al. 1996). Humates obtained from pig manure vermicompost increased growth of tomato (Atiyeh et al. 2002) and those obtained from cattle, food and paper waste vermicompost increased the growth of strawberries and peppers (Arancon et al. 2003 a).|$|R
