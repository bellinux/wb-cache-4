30|$|Hot {{pressing}} {{plays an}} important role in overall particleboard performance. It provides the thermal energy and mechanical force of compression to consolidate <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> [1]. This process is complex and involves heat and mass transfer inside <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> of <b>the</b> panels [2]. Heat is transferred from the hot platens to <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> surfaces by conduction [1, 3]. Then, the moisture at <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> surface vaporises and generates vapour pressure with increasing temperature. The vapour flows vertically and transfers the heat from the surface to the centre of <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> panels. After <b>the</b> temperature of <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> centre reaches <b>the</b> local boiling point of water (100  °C), water vaporisation accelerates and the increased pressure makes the vapour flow horizontally to the edges of <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> panels.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The medial axis {{transform}} (MAT) {{has potential}} {{as an alternative}} representation for certain design and modeling problems. To exploit this potential, however, {{it is essential that}} the boundary of the object which an MAT represents be easily determined. For two-dimensional objects, <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> consists of curves in three-space. Given a valid MAT, that is, a set of curves which comprise <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> of a valid boundary as defined below, the boundary points related to any particular point on <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> can be found, based solely on <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> point and <b>the</b> tangent(s) to <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> at <b>the</b> point.

We also show a smoothness property of <b>the</b> <b>MAT,</b> and detail <b>the</b> requirements for a graph in threespace to be a valid MAT.

Although seasonal variability exists, a major percentage of the O 2 produced during the day did not diffuse out of <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> but was used within <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> to oxidize both organic carbon and the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction.

50|$|After being swallowed, food travels {{down the}} {{oesophagus}} and is {{deposited in the}} dorsal part of the reticulum. Contractions of the reticulorumen propel and mix the recently ingested feed into <b>the</b> ruminal <b>mat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mat</b> is a thick mass of digesta, consisting of partially degraded, long, fibrous material. Most material in <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> has been recently ingested, and as such, has considerable fermentable substrate remaining. Microbial fermentation proceeds rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>mat,</b> releasing many gases. Some of these gases are trapped in <b>the</b> <b>mat,</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> to be buoyant. As fermentation proceeds, fermentable substrate is exhausted, gas production decreases, and particles lose buoyancy due to loss of entrapped gas. Digesta in <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> hence goes through a phase of increasing buoyancy followed by decreasing buoyancy. Simultaneously, the size of digesta particles-relatively large when ingested-is reduced by microbial fermentation and, later, rumination. Incomplete digestion of plant material here {{will result in the}} formation of a type of bezoar called Phythobezoars. At a certain point, particles are dense and small enough that they may “fall” through <b>the</b> rumen <b>mat</b> into <b>the</b> ventral sac below, or they may be swept out of <b>the</b> rumen <b>mat</b> into <b>the</b> reticulum by liquid gushing through <b>the</b> <b>mat</b> during ruminal contractions. Once in the ventral sac, digesta continues to ferment at decreased rates, further losing buoyancy and decreasing in particle size. It is soon swept into the ventral reticulum by ruminal contractions.|$|R

25|$|Early {{molluscs}} {{appear to}} have grazed on microbial mats, so it is natural to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where <b>the</b> <b>mats</b> could survive. The earliest known fossils of monoplacophoran ("single-plated") molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft subtrates in deep parts of the seas, although one genus lives on hard substrates {{at the edges of}} continental shelves. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately the oldest known fossils of polyplacophorans (molluscs with multiple shell plates) are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with stromatolites (stubby pillars built by some types of microbial mat colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea. No fossils have been found of aplacophorans (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesBrucellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common zoonoses in the world, and occurs mainly in farmers, {{slaughterhouse}} workers, and veterinarians via direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their products. The clinical symptoms of human brucellosis are nonspecific, such as fever, headache, chills, and sweating. Diagnosis and treatment of brucellosis requires laboratory tests. Although the serum tube agglutination test (SAT) is the standardized gold method, it is laborious, time consuming, and requires a number of reagents. A microagglutination test (<b>MAT)</b> variant of <b>the</b> SAT or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is recommended for serological diagnoses. For the simple and rapid diagnosis of brucellosis, <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> was standardized using samples for the SAT to define positive and negative categories, and we then compared the sensitivity and specificity of <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> and ELISA. MethodsThirty SAT-positive sera and 60 SAT-negative sera were used in this study. Antibody titers of ≥ 1 : 160 were considered positive readings in both <b>the</b> SAT and <b>MAT.</b> Brucella abortus antigens and Brucella-positive control antiserum were used in <b>the</b> SAT and <b>MAT.</b> ELISAs of IgM and IgG were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. ResultsThe titers of <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> differed according to antigen concentration. The optimal concentration of B abortus antigen was determined to compare the sensitivity and specificity between <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> and SAT. <b>The</b> sensitivity and specificity of <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> were 93. 3 % and 96. 7 %, respectively, for IgG with reference to ELISA, and 96. 7 % and 98. 3 %, respectively, for IgM. ConclusionsThe optimal concentration of antigen for <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> was 1 : 10. <b>The</b> <b>MAT</b> is less time consuming and requires less antigen and serum than the SAT.  The results of <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> showed good agreement with those of ELISA. The results of this study suggest that <b>the</b> <b>MAT</b> could be useful for diagnosis of brucellosis...|$|R
