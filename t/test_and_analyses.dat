40|$|Independence of {{observations}} is often assumed when adjusting geodetic network. Unlike the distance observations, no dependence of environmental conditions {{is known for}} horizontal direction observations. In {{order to determine the}} dependence of horizontal direction observations, we established test geodetic network of a station and four observation points. Measurements of the highest possible accuracy were carried out using Leica TS 30 total station along with precise prisms GPH 1 P. Two series of hundred sets of angles were measured, with the first one in bad observation conditions. Using different methods, i. e. variance–covariance matrices, x 2 <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> of time series, the independence of measured directions, reduced directions and horizontal angles were tested. The results show that the independence of horizontal direction observations is not obvious and certainly not in poor conditions.

40|$|Abstract—Evaluating the {{performance}} (timing behavior, throughput, and resource utilization) of a software system be-comes {{more and more}} challenging as today’s enterprise ap-plications are built on a large basis of existing software (e. g. middleware, legacy applications, and third party services). As {{the performance}} of a system is affected by multiple factors on each layer of the system, performance analysts require detailed knowl-edge about the system under test and have to deal with a huge number of tools for benchmarking, monitoring, and analyzing. In practice, performance analysts try to handle the complexity by focusing on certain aspects, tools, or technologies. However, these isolated solutions are inefficient due to the small reuse and knowledge sharing. The Performance Cockpit presented in this paper is a framework that encapsulates knowledge about performance engineering, the system under <b>test,</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> in a single application by providing a flexible, plug-in based architecture. We demonstrate the value of the framework by means of two different case studies. I...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Competitors {{engage in}} product market {{predation}} when they lower prices or increase expenditures on non-price {{competition with the}} goal of forcing a rival to exit. This study provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that financially constrained firms avoid financial statement disclosure to mitigate the risk of product market predation. The empirical analysis examines German private firms, the majority of which failed to comply with financial statement public disclosure requirements until a regulatory change in 2006 dramatically increased the cost of non-compliance. The evidence suggests the relation between financial constraint and disclosure avoidance is increasing at an increasing rate. Consistent with the risk of predation driving this relation, the results are substantially stronger for firms with other characteristics linked to predation risk. Additional and supplemental tests, including a falsification <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> of ex post performance, reinforce my interpretation of the results. The findings suggest an important link between disclosure and financing decisions and contribute to the broader literature on proprietary costs of disclosure...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare hearing {{performance}} {{relating to}} the peripheral and central auditory system between solvent-exposed and non-exposed workers. METHODS: Forty-eight workers exposed to a mixture of solvents and 48 non-exposed control subjects of matched age, gender and educational level were selected {{to participate in the}} study. The evaluation procedures included: pure-tone audiometry (500 - 8, 000 Hz), to investigate the peripheral auditory system; the Random Gap Detection test, to assess the central auditory system; and the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, to investigate subjects' self-reported hearing performance in daily-life activities. A Student t <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> of covariance (ANCOVA) were computed to determine possible significant differences between solvent-exposed and non-exposed subjects for the hearing level, Random Gap Detection test and Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap. Pearson correlations among the three measures were also calculated. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects exhibited significantly poorer hearing thresholds for the right ear than non-exposed subjects. Also, solvent-exposed subjects exhibited poorer results for the Random Gap Detection test and self-reported poorer listening performance than non-exposed subjects. Results of the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap were significantly correlated with the binaural average of subject pure-tone thresholds and Random Gap Detection test performance.

40|$|Keel bone {{damage is}} a wide-spread welfare problem in laying hens. It is unclear so far whether bone quality relates to keel bone damage. The {{goal of the}} present study was to detect {{possible}} associations between keel bone damage and bone properties of intact and damaged keel bones and of tibias in end-of-lay hens raised in loose housing systems. Bones were palpated and examined by peripheral quantitative computer tomography (PQCT), a three-point bending <b>test,</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> of bone ash. Contrary to our expectations, PQCT revealed higher cortical and trabecular contents in fractured than in intact keel bones. This might be due to structural bone repair after fractures. Density measurements of cortical and trabecular tissues of keel bones did not differ between individuals with and without fractures. In the three-point bending test of the tibias, ultimate shear strength was significantly higher in birds with intact vs. fractured keel bones. Likewise, birds with intact or slightly deviated keel bones had higher mineral and calcium contents of the keel bone than birds with fractured keel bones. Calcium content in keel bones was correlated with calcium content in tibias. Although there were some associations between bone traits related to bone strength and keel bone damage, other factors such as stochastic events related to housing such as falls and collisions seem to be at least as important for the prevalence of keel bone damage...|$|E

The study was conducted at Madrasah Aliyah Negeri Sumedang, particularly the tenth grade. It aims {{to answer the following}} research question: 1. what is the effect of implementing Genre Based Approach on students’ writing ability? 2. What progress or improvement do the students make in learning recount text through Genre Based Approach? This study employed a true experimental design. The data were collected from a pretest, post <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> of students’ texts. The researcher applied Genre Based Approach to the experiment class, on the other hand, the control class was taught using a regular method, a method which generally consists lecturing, discussing and games without structured cycle process. The obtained data from pretest and post test were calculated using a t-test to identify whether there is {{a significant difference between the}} test scores of both groups, experimental and control group. The analyses of students’ texts presented were used to find the students’ progress or improvement that the students make after implementing Genre Based Approach. The result of this study shows that Genre Based Approach has a significant effect on students’ writing ability. With a level of significance of 0. 05, the value of t-test is higher than t-table. The result describes that there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores obtained by the experimental group. In other words, there is an effect of implementing Genre Based Approach on students’ writing ability. With regard to the development of students’ writing abilities as shown in the texts produced by the students, the students’ writing skill were significantly improved in terms of the schematic structure and linguistic features. However, there is a gap between the high and low achiever students. The low achiever students could not arrange the texts well so their texts could not fulfill the requirement of recount text. The students also made mistakes when using linguistic features. They could not apply appropriate conjunction, circumstance and complex sentence. They also had difficulties, for example in understanding and using past tense. Besides, the students also tend to translate their own draft word for word. Seeing this fact, it indicates that these students still need the teacher’s scaffolding in writing their texts. Based on these findings, the researcher believes that Genre Based Approach has the potential to improve students’ writing ability, therefore she recommended that Genre Based Approach be applied in the teaching writing in Indonesia...|$|E
