On 18 December 1951, {{when he was}} three years old, he, his older brother Raúl, then five, and an eight-year-old friend were playing and the Salinas family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela, was shot. It was never determined which of the three boys pulled the trigger and the incident was declared an accident; it was given newspaper coverage in Excélsior at the time. A judge blamed the Salinas parents for leaving a loaded weapon accessible to their small children. The Salinas family {{did not know the}} last name of their 12-year-old maid Manuela—only <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> from San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo—and it is unknown whether her family ever claimed her body.

He graduated in law and economics at unspecified time in the late 1920s. In February 1936 he married María Dolores Aburto Renobales (?-2004), descendant to a wealthy bourgeoisie Biscay family.
