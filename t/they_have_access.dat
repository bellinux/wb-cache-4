5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they {{are essential to}} ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices. The increased market share gave them more leverage in negotiations with insurers over costs and reduced patient care options.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.|$|E

Though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to air and artillery support, these were rarely used. Instead, The Senoi Praaq preferred more intimate tactics.|$|R
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
5|$|The Combine use a large {{array of}} science fiction technology. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to {{teleportation}} technology, which takes them from their dimension to Earth. However, their teleporter technology is restrictive in comparison to that developed by Eli Vance, Isaac Kleiner and Judith Mossman in that it cannot be used to teleport to other locations on Earth without significant modification. Throughout the games, various futuristic computer consoles, doors, power sources and weapon emplacements are encountered. In addition, the Combine employ the use of small airborne robots, scanners, to observe the citizens of Earth. The city variant merely moves about the streets, monitors individuals, and takes photographs, while the combat equivalent is capable of dropping mines into an area. Civil Protection makes use of smaller airborne robots called manhacks, which fly using razor-sharp rotating blades with which they attack their targets to cause laceration injuries. These are often deployed in closed-in areas. The Combine also use two types of land mines; hopper mines throw themselves {{into the air and}} detonate when an enemy is detected nearby, while the spherical rollermines roll towards vehicles or other enemies, attach themselves and deliver damaging electrical attacks. Combine technology is also used to transform humans into Overwatch soldiers or stalkers, deformed and mutilated humans with no memory of their past selves who act as slaves and maintenance workers in Combine facilities. Transformation into a Stalker is considered among the Combine's worst punishments for dissidents.|$|E

50|$|There {{was no way}} {{for these}} small phone {{companies}} to identify the culprits of these hacks. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> no <b>access</b> to local phone company records of calls into their access numbers, and even if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>access,</b> obtaining such records would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some advancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the problem did not completely disappear until most long distance companies were able to offer standard 1+ dialing {{without the use of}} an access number.|$|R

25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In ecotone habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to enough green vegetation, topi usually {{do not have to}} drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to {{get a good look at}} their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} Nintendo home consoles, the Switch is region-free, allowing {{players to}} use cartridges or downloaded content from {{any part of}} the world, though Nintendo recommends using the appropriate regional eShop for digital purposes for obtaining the best post-purchase support if needed. Further, eShop purchases, while still tied to the Nintendo Account, are not tied to the specific Switch console, as was the case for previous Nintendo hardware. Once the user re-registers their account to a Switch, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to download all previous purchases; however, a user can only have their account registered on one console at a time, and downloaded software tied to an account cannot be used if that account is not registered to the device. The Switch does not support optical discs and is not backwards compatible with the 3DS and Wii U game media. The Switch is not backwards compatible with other digital titles from previous consoles. The console also did not launch with the Virtual Console, which provided digital versions of physically released games from past Nintendo consoles, but the company said this feature may be added later. Kimishima said that the Switch is powerful enough to emulate titles from previous Nintendo consoles, but currently does not support controllers or controller emulation for these titles.|$|E
25|$|Like black widows, {{the female}} S. grossa is 6-10.5mm {{in length and}} dark colored with a round, bulbous abdomen. Typical {{coloration}} ranges from purplish brown to black, with light-colored markings. Unlike black widows, redbacks, and other Latrodectus species, S. grossa {{does not have a}} bright red hourglass pattern or any other bright markings. Like many spiders, the male is sometimes smaller but can many times be nearly as long as the females. It measures 4.1-10.0mm in length and is thinner than the female. The two sexes are colored similarly; however, the sexually mature male almost always has lighter, more reddish-coloured legs than the female. S. grossa spiders may shed up to six times (instars) before reaching maturity. They can go several months without feeding, provided <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to water. A well-fed female can lay three or more egg sacs each year. Each egg sac typically contains between 40-100 eggs. The mother can often be observed watching her eggs for hours, even days, at a time once the eggs start changing color and grow close to hatching. At normal household temp/humidity, an egg will usually hatch within a month of being laid. The spiderlings are independent from time of hatch.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked if}} he regretted {{supporting}} Islamist groups in their fight against the Soviet Union, Brzezinski replied, “What {{was more important to}} the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of central Europe {{and the end of the}} Cold war?” Brzezinski argued that U.S. aid was [...] "quite important in hastening the end of the conflict, not in deciding the conflict," [...] as [...] "in my view, the Afghans would have prevailed in the end anyway, 'cause <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to money, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to weapons, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> the will to fight." [...] He further noted: [...] "The Soviet Union at the time was actively engaged in helping international terrorism, including those elements of the PLO that were very active ...

25|$|The {{most common}} type of ghosts, {{referred}} to as ghosts or the dead, are the hun or higher souls of mortals who have refused to pass into Lethe and reincarnation due to their attachment to their mortal lives. These ghosts are much weaker than Exalted, and they can only respire Essence in the Underworld and Shadowlands. Hungry ghosts generally come into existence due to betrayal, vengeance or a traumatic death. Initially, a hungry ghost includes both the higher soul and the po, or lower soul, but the hun soon moves on, leaving the hungry ghost largely mindless. Unlike other ghosts, hungry ghosts are naturally material in Creation at night. Nephwracks are ghosts who have been corrupted by the Neverborn. Unlike uncorrupted ghosts, they are capable of using necromancy. The Deathlords are thirteen ghosts of powerful Solar Exalted who have been empowered by the Neverborn, and although they are not technically Exalted, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to Abyssal Charms. Spectres, also known as plasmics, are bizarre creatures spawned by the nightmares of the Neverborn. The category of Hekatonkhire includes the ghosts of demons, devas and Primordial behemoths, as well as the manifested nightmares of the Neverborn. The Neverborn are the ghosts of slain Primordials. Immensely powerful, they are difficult to rouse from their slumber, and their power seems largely constrained to the Labyrinth. Only mundane ghosts and Hekatonkhire can be summoned through necromancy, and only mundane ghosts can be summoned through sorcery.|$|E
500|$|Cats are {{familiar}} and easily kept animals, and their physiology {{has been particularly}} well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.

500|$|Dawn of Sorrow, {{similar to}} most {{games in the}} Castlevania series, {{is set in a}} castle, which is further {{subdivided}} into various areas. [...] Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of theme music that plays while the player remains in that area. The character moves around the environment based on the player's choices; however, the areas the character can move into are restricted based upon the items the player has, similar to most platform games. Progression, however, is not linear, as players are free to explore the parts of the castle <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.|$|E
50|$|Life on the {{frontier}} was hard, clearing land and farming was backbreaking work, and the women had to work right alongside the men even in the hardest work. Women could help supplement their families income if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to livestock. <b>Having</b> <b>access</b> to milk or eggs could round out a bland diet, and many women could use the extra eggs or butter to sell or trade for other goods.|$|R

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is split}} into two types of sections: investigations and trials. During investigations, the player goes to the crime scene, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to a menu with four options: examine, which brings up a cursor used to search for evidence and clues; talk, which lets the player interview a witness at the current location, choosing {{from a number of}} a topics to discuss; present, which lets the player show the witness evidence; and move, which brings up a list of locations the player can choose to go to. At some points, the player can use Apollo's [...] "perceive" [...] mechanic to watch for visual cues in a witness as they are talking, such as a twitching eye, that indicate that they are lying. The player can also sometimes use Phoenix's [...] "psyche-lock" [...] mechanic to see locks on the hearts of witnesses who are hiding something.|$|E
500|$|After {{this first}} screen, players are taken the main puzzle solving interface, which {{provides}} {{instructions for the}} current puzzle on the top screen while allowing the player to interact directly with the touch screen in order to solve the puzzle. The player has an infinite {{amount of time to}} complete each puzzle, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to an in-game memo pad function to aid them in solving each puzzle. If they do not wish to solve the puzzle at the time, they can hit the button labelled [...] "Quit" [...] in order to exit the interface without losing any Picarats. Additionally, all puzzles have three hints available that can be purchased with tokens called [...] "hint coins". If a player needs more help, they can also purchase a fourth [...] "super hint", a more detailed hint that costs two hint coins. However, there are a limited amount of hint coins, and the game recommends they be used wisely. [...] The player starts with ten hint coins, but more can be obtained by thorough investigation of the village.|$|E

With the chips, objects, collectibles and enemies are automatically tagged and highlighted via augmented reality of the heads-up display. Players can use the [...] "breaching" [...] abilities to hack into enemies' minds and control their actions. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> to three options; [...] "Backfire" [...] that causes enemies' weapons to malfunction and backfire, stunning them; [...] "Suicide" [...] that causes enemies to kill themselves; and [...] "Persuade" [...] that leads enemies to defect to the player's side before committing suicide. The game also allows players to locate enemies behind cover {{with the use of}} [...] "Dart Overlay" [...] and slow down time temporarily, which increases the damages dealt by players and their health regeneration rate. Abilities and skills implanted in the chip can be enhanced by collecting and extracting the chips of fallen enemies. The upgrades can boost players' damages and increases their recovery speed. Players are tasked with using the breaching abilities to interact with objects, solve environmental puzzles, strip the special armor of enemies and disarm explosives. The breaching mechanic has a time limit and must be recharged before another activation.|$|E
