5|$|According to an anecdote, {{the idea}} arose after {{a group of}} Royal Navy {{officers}} saw a similar, but fictional, bomb depicted in the 1943 Walt Disney animated propaganda film Victory Through Air Power, and the name Disney was consequently given to the weapon. The Royal Navy developed the bomb even though the Fleet Air Arm operated no aircraft capable of carrying it. The navy was interested in a concrete-penetrating weapon due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> navy's extensive use of fortified submarine pens to protect their U-boats and E-boats from air attack while docked.|$|E
5|$|After Rhodes and the London {{consortium}} {{agreed to}} pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support {{over the next}} few months, prompting the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, to approve the royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later. Attempting to set up a rival to the Rudd Concession, Lobengula granted similar rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891, but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well. Company troops conquered Matabeleland during the First Matabele War of , and Lobengula died from smallpox in exile soon after.|$|E
5|$|After the 2/48th Battalion {{completed}} its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further {{along the coast}} to Gazala.

They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failed}} {{offensive}} at the Battle of Loos in 1915, French was replaced as {{commander of the}} BEF by Haig, who remained in command {{for the rest of}} the war. He became most famous for his role as its commander during the battle of the Somme, the battle of Passchendaele, and the Hundred Days Offensive, the series of victories leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> surrender in 1918. Haig was succeeded in command of the First Army by General Charles Carmichael Monro, who in turn was succeeded by General Henry Horne in September 1916, the only officer with an artillery background to command a British army during the war.|$|E
5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, {{as noted by}} the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to one-half of Vilnius's population, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad.

5|$|Cranmer's {{first contact}} with a Continental {{reformer}} was with Simon Grynaeus, a humanist based in Basel, Switzerland, and a follower of the Swiss reformers, Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius. In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers. He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>German</b> reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend.

Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

50|$|Operation Pike {{was a plan}} {{developed}} by the United Kingdom and France <b>to</b> bomb <b>the</b> Azerbaijani SSR city of Baku in order to eliminate {{a major source of}} German oil.

The Soviet supply of oil <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> led <b>the</b> Allies <b>to</b> portray <b>the</b> Soviet Union as an ally of Germany in propaganda. <b>The</b> mechanized <b>German</b> army required huge amounts of fossil fuels to sustain it and would be in a deficit without Soviet, specifically Azerbaijani, oil. <b>The</b> Allies hoped <b>to</b> starve <b>the</b> <b>German</b> army for resources, halting the axis Blitzkrieg into France.
