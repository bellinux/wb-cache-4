Circuit breakers with an overcurrent <b>tripping</b> <b>unit</b> work with bimetal. When the bimetal is warmed up enough, it causes disconnection of circuit.

40|$|BACKGROUND The primary {{containment}} isolation instrumentation automatically initiates closure of appropriate {{primary containment}} isolation valves (PCIVs). The {{function of the}} PCIVs, {{in combination with other}} accident mitigation systems, is to limit fission product release during and following postulated Design Basis Accidents (DBAs). Primary containment isolation within the time limits specified for those isolation valves designed to close automatically ensures that the release of radioactive material to the environment will be consistent with the assumptions used in the analyses for a DBA. The isolation instrumentation includes the sensors, relays, and switches that are necessary to cause initiation of primary containment and reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) isolation. Most channels include electronic equipment (e. g., <b>trip</b> <b>units)</b> that compares measured input signals with pre-established setpoints.

40|$|Abstract: In {{practical}} longitudinal power systems, transient instability {{is mainly}} caused {{by one or more}} severe contingencies such as a double transmission line outage (N- 2) or a multiple line outage (ML) while the inter-area transfer power is approaching its limit.

30|$|Some {{of the bus}} and branch outages may trip {{neighboring}} branches. Similar to {{the components}} outage modeling, the protective relay actions are modeled by using random sampling of relay operations. This requires the statistics of tripping of neighboring branches. Clearing a fault can initiate dynamic interactions and exchanges at some operating conditions. These interactions mostly occur due {{to the existence of}} large wind turbine generators because the rapid responsive generators respond faster than slow units (e.g. wind). The plants that interact dynamically share the network load in an oscillatory pattern due to the constant low frequency power angle oscillations interacting in the system, which can also continue {{for an extended period of}} time. Depending on time constants of units and their controls, the resulting operating condition may even destabilize weak units and disconnect them from the network. The instability <b>tripping</b> of <b>units</b> due to dynamic interactions are also modeled by using random sampling of stability of units.|$|R
