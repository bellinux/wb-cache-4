5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace {{the route of the}} Ford van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31am {{on the morning of the}} explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> not injured.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35inches (161mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from {{four days of}} rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20homes were destroyed, and 20villages were left without power. A transport vehicle carrying 15people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> later rescued by police workers. About 300hectares (740acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended. Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000people, and initially there were two people missing; however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E

Secondly, <b>the</b> virtual prototype model of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> established and traveling process is simulated.

The bed of <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> full of plastic containers of chemicals; some unlabeled. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides.

25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E

One of the victims was the truck's original driver, Łukasz Urban, who was found shot dead in the passenger seat. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> <b>was</b> eventually stopped by its automatic brakes.
