5|$|Heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (HIT) is the {{development}} of <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and <b>thrombocytopenia</b> caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{during the}} All-Star Week, Williams was {{diagnosed}} of <b>thrombocytopenia</b> {{and was out}} for the remaining games of the entire conference. With his absence, his team {{did not last long}} and was eliminated by the Burger King Whoopers. He was also cut from the training pool for the national team because of his illness.|$|E
5|$|Initially, various {{theories}} existed {{about the}} exact {{cause of the}} low platelets in HIT. Gradually, evidence accumulated on the exact underlying mechanism. In 1984-1986, John G. Kelton and colleagues at McMaster University Medical School developed the laboratory tests {{that could be used}} to confirm or exclude heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia</b> until {{platelet}} count has improved or normalised. Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these thrombophilic conditions {{increase the risk of}} skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious side effect associated with warfarin.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called <b>thrombocytopenia.</b> However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface of}} the platelet. This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to <b>thrombocytopenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|While heparin was {{introduced}} {{for clinical use}} in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with <b>thrombocytopenia</b> was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features {{were the result of}} an immune process.|$|E
5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone marrow. This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and <b>thrombocytopenia.</b> The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone marrow, which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E
5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
25|$|Major {{side effects}} of tinzaparin are {{osteoporosis}} (occurring in up to 1% of cases), <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia),</b> haemorrhage, hair loss and drug allergy. Still, LMWHs are {{much less likely to}} cause heparin-induced <b>thrombocytopenia</b> than unfractionated heparin.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{cases of}} MDS present with {{isolated}} neutropenia or <b>thrombocytopenia</b> without anemia and with dysplastic changes {{confined to the}} single lineage. The term refractory neutropenia and refractory <b>thrombocytopenia</b> have sometimes been used to describe these cases. A diagnosis of MDS in patients with neutropenia or <b>thrombocytopenia</b> without anemia should be made with caution.|$|E
25|$|Immune <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (ITP) {{is a type}} of thrombocytopenic purpura {{defined as}} {{isolated}} low platelet count (<b>thrombocytopenia)</b> with normal bone marrow and the absence of other causes of <b>thrombocytopenia.</b> It causes a characteristic purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and has a spontaneous resolution within two months. Chronic immune <b>thrombocytopenia</b> persists longer than six months with a specific cause being unknown.|$|E
25|$|In severe <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> a {{bone marrow}} study can {{determine}} the number, size and maturity of the megakaryocytes. This information may identify ineffective platelet production {{as the cause of}} <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombocytopenia</b> can be {{inherited}} or acquired.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} medications can induce <b>thrombocytopenia</b> {{through direct}} myelosuppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{cerebrospinal}} fluid and blood tests are typically normal, except for anemia and <b>thrombocytopenia</b> in some children.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytes - as <b>thrombocytopenia</b> {{is one of}} the {{complications}} of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{blood transfusions}} {{may be needed}} to control anemia, and <b>thrombocytopenia</b> can be managed with splenectomy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombocytopenia</b> is a {{condition}} characterized by abnormally low levels of thrombocytes, also known as platelets, in the blood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombocytopenia</b> {{usually has}} no {{symptoms}} and {{is picked up}} on a routine full blood count (or complete blood count). Some individuals with <b>thrombocytopenia</b> may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds, and/or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms and petechiae in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, {{may be caused by}} spontaneous bleeding under the skin.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{contraindications}} to {{bone marrow}} examination. It {{is important to}} note that <b>thrombocytopenia</b> or bleeding disorders are not contraindications as long as the procedure is performed by a skilled clinician. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be safely performed even in the setting of extreme <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (low platelet count). If there is a skin or soft tissue infection over the hip, a different site should be chosen for bone marrow examination.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholics {{may have}} anemia from several causes; {{they may also}} develop <b>thrombocytopenia</b> from direct toxic effect on megakaryocytes, or from hypersplenism.|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive {{antibodies}} in the patient, {{leading to}} severe <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and bleeding with florid petechial hemorrhages, ecchymoses, and wet purpura.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} common {{variable}} immunodeficiency (CVID) where multiple autoimmune diseases are seen, e.g.: inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and autoimmune thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, {{the rapid}} and {{premature}} destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and <b>thrombocytopenia</b> (with {{an increased risk}} of infection and bleeding).|$|E
25|$|Full {{blood count}} and {{examination}} of blood film: The blood film morphology can provide clues about hemolytic anemia, clumping of the platelets leading to spurious <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> or leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Newborn babies {{experience}} with vomiting, acidosis, hyperammonemia, hepatomegaly (enlarged livers), hyperglycinemia (high glycine levels), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Later, cases of <b>thrombocytopenia</b> and neutropenia can occur.|$|E
25|$|Many {{affected}} {{children develop}} anemia, {{which may be}} macrocytic in type. Some also develop <b>thrombocytopenia.</b> Bone marrow examinations may show megaloblasts and increased erythropoiesis or bone marrow suppression.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis, erythema multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} of other causes of cytopenias, {{along with a}} dysplastic bone marrow, is required to diagnose a myelodysplastic syndrome, so differentiating MDS from anemia, <b>thrombocytopenia,</b> and leukopenia is important.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombocytopenia</b> is only {{caused by}} RMP and no test dosing need be done. Regimens omitting RMP are {{discussed}} below. Please {{refer to the}} entry on rifampicin for further details.|$|E
25|$|Coagulopathy {{is another}} {{cardinal}} feature of ALF. The liver has {{the central role}} in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both quantitative and qualitative platelet defects). Progressive <b>thrombocytopenia</b> with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. <b>Thrombocytopenia</b> with or without DIC increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thrombocytopenia</b> - {{typically}} multifactorial. Due to alcoholic marrow suppression, sepsis, lack of folate, platelet sequestering in the spleen {{as well as}} decreased thrombopoietin. However, this rarely {{results in}} a platelet count < 50 000/mL.|$|E
