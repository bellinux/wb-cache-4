5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
25|$|One famous Nixe {{of recent}} German folklore, {{deriving}} from 19th-century literature, was Lorelei; {{according to the}} legend, {{she sat on the}} rock at the Rhine which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in lake Zug (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circle}} of her {{literary}} friends, Lokhvitskaya was surrounded by 'aura of adoration'; {{it seemed as if}} every man, according to a biographer, [...] "was a little in love with her." [...] Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya was the only person whom he remembered fondly. [...] "Everything in her was charming: <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> the liveliness of her speech, the glitter of her eye, her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple," [...] Bunin wrote in his memoirs.|$|E

2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
