40|$|We {{investigate}} the question: under which conditions is a oe-compact partial two point {{contained in a}} <b>two</b> point <b>set?</b> We show that no reasonable measure or capacity (when applied to the set itself) can provide a sufficient condition for a compact partial <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> to be extendable to a <b>two</b> point <b>set.</b> On the other hand, we prove that under Martin's Axiom any oe-compact partial <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> such that its square has Hausdorff 1 -measure zero is extendable. 1. Introduction A planar set is called a <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> if every line intersects the <b>set</b> in exactly <b>two</b> points and a partial <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> if every line intersects the set in at most two points. We call a partial <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> extendable {{if it is a}} subset of some <b>two</b> point <b>set.</b> The existence of <b>two</b> point <b>sets</b> is due to Mazurkiewicz [7]. His proof shows that every partial <b>two</b> point <b>set</b> with cardinality less than c is extendable.

5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless).

They function as camouflage {{and as a}} shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
