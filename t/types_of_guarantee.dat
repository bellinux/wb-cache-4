40|$|We present {{algorithms}} and hardness {{results for}} three resource allocation problems. The first is an abstract admission control problem where the system receives {{a series of}} requests and wants to satisfy as many as possible, but has bounded resources. This occurs, for example, when al-locating network bandwidth to incoming calls so the calls receive guaranteed quality of service. Algorithms can have performance guarantees for this problem either with respect to acceptances or with respect to rejections. These types of guarantees are incomparable and algorithms having dif-ferent <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> can have nearly opposite behavior. We give two procedures for combining one algorithm of each type into a single algorithm having both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> simultaneously. Specifically, if we combine an algorithm that is cA-competitive for acceptances with an algorithm that is cR-competitive for rejections, the combined algorithm is O(cA) -competitive for acceptance and O(cAcR) -competitive for rejections. If both the input algorithms are deterministic, then so is the combined algorithm. In addition, one of the combining procedures {{does not need to}} know the value of cA and neither needs to know the value of cR. The second problem we consider is scheduling with rejections, a combination of schedulin...|$|E

40|$|A new {{guarantee}} model for accepting dynamically arriving sporadic tasks {{is presented in}} this paper. In this model, sporadic tasks have two costs associated with them. The costs represent the overheads a system will incur if the task is rejected and/or misses its deadline. The basic idea of the proposed model is to accept a task only if accepting the task lowers the expected cost due missed sporadic task deadlines. The key feature of the proposed model {{is that it can}} be viewed as a generalization of the traditional deterministic and the probabilistic {{guarantee model}}s. By suitably setting the costs associated with the sporadic tasks, the proposed model can be made equivalent to either the deterministic or the probabilistic guarantee model. In general, however, the proposed model achieves a balance between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> depending on the exact costs associated with a sporadic task. A scheduling policy based on the proposed model is also presented in this paper. The policy is [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Small {{businesses}} are considered important engines for job growth {{and economic development}} by policy makers worldwide. One {{of the most commonly}} cited constraints of small businesses is a lack of access to capital. To address this constraint, small business loan guarantee programs have been established in over 100 countries. There are a variety of <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> funds, with the most significant differences being which borrowers are eligible for guarantees, and how borrowers are approved for guarantees. There is currently no clear delineation between types of programs and the economic conditions they operate in, though some trends are becoming apparent. However, these trends may not be leading to the best economic outcomes possible. By better matching the structure of the guarantee fund to the economic conditions it operates in, the program’s success in meeting economic development goals may be greatly improved. Many programs in developing countries may not be taking advantage of bank expertise and may be limiting the scope of their effectiveness. At the same time, programs in developed countries may be wasting resources by scattering their efforts too thinly and subsidizing less competitive firms to the detriment of local economic development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} methodics of credit process of a {{particular}} credit union present on the Czech market. Because of confidentiality, {{the name of the}} credit union is not mentioned. The thesis is divided into four parts. The first part deals with characteristics of credit unions, their specifications and differences from banks. You can find in this part comparison of development of particular values of the analyzed credit union with the whole sector of Czech credit unions and bank sector as well. The second part is focused on importance of credit process, specifics of the balance of credit institutions, description of risks connected to credit process and principle of state regulation of this process. The third part describes in more details credit process of the analyzed credit union with further focus on acquisition period, credit analysis and decision making process. The last part explains questions of guarantee with all the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> of the analyzed credit union mentioned.

Algorithms can have performance guarantees for this problem either with respect to acceptances or with respect to rejections. These types of guarantees are incomparable and algorithms having different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> can have nearly opposite behavior. We give two procedures for combining one algorithm of each type into a single algorithm having both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> simultaneously. Specifically, if we combine an algorithm that is c_A-competitive for acceptances with an algorithm that is c_R-competitive for rejections, the combined algorithm is O(c_A) -competitive for acceptance and O(c_A c_R) -competitive for rejections. If both the input algorithms are deterministic, then so is the combined algorithm. In addition, one of the combining procedures {{does not need to}} know the value of c_A and neither needs to know the value of c_R. The second problem we consider is scheduling with rejections, a combination of scheduling and admission control. For this problem, each job comes with a rejection cost in addition to the standard scheduling parameters. The system produces a schedule for a subset of the jobs and the schedule quality is its total flow time added to the cost for all rejected jobs. We show that, even if all jobs have the same rejection cost, no online algorithm has a competitive ratio better than (1 / 2) (2 +sqrt{ 2 }) in general or e/(e- 1) if all jobs have the same processing time. We also give an optimal offline algorithm for unit-length jobs with arbitrary rejection costs. This leads to a pair of 2 -competitive online algorithms for unit-length jobs, one when all rejection costs are equal and one when they are arbitrary. Finally, we show that the offline problem is NP-hard even when each job's rejection cost is proportional to its processing time. Our third problem is power-aware scheduling, where the processor can run at different speeds, with its energy consumption depending on the speeds selected. This results in a bicriteria problem with conflicting goals of minimizing energy consumption and giving a high-quality schedule. If schedule quality is measured with makespan, we give linear-time algorithms to compute all non-dominated solutions for the general uniprocessor problem and for the multiprocessor problem when every job requires the same amount of work. We also show that the multiprocessor problem becomes NP-hard when jobs can require different amounts of work. If schedule quality is measured with total flow time, we show that the optimal schedule corresponding to a particular energy budget cannot be exactly computed on a machine supporting arithmetic and the extraction of roots. This hardness result holds even when scheduling equal-work jobs on a uniprocessor. We do, however, give an arbitrarily-good approximation for scheduling equal-work jobs on a multiprocessor...|$|E
