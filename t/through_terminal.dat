25|$|Until 2014, Terminal B {{was split}} into {{north and south}} {{building}}s, with a parking garage located between the two buildings. The gates of the south building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and housing an Admirals Club) are divided into three groups: B1–B3, B4–B14 and B15–B19. Gates B1–B3 are the exclusive use of Air Canada. There is a single security lane for these three gates resulting in short wait times. However, to reach other gates in Terminal B including connections to Air Canada's Star Alliance partner United, {{it is necessary to}} leave the secure area and re-enter. Post-security, there is only a grab-and-go restaurant and there is no lounge access. As passengers arriving from Canada are pre-cleared by US Customs and Border Protection, passengers do not need to pass <b>through</b> <b>Terminal</b> E's international arrival facility. Gates B4–14 and B15–B19 are connected by a walkway post-security. The gates of the north building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and United Airlines, both of which operate airline lounges in the terminal) are divided into two groups: B20–B36 and B37–B38. Gates B20–29 are used by United Airlines while gates B30–B36 serve American Airlines. Gates B37 and B38 are home to Spirit Airlines.|$|E
