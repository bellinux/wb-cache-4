5000|$|Contrary {{to initial}} intensions, the Polish {{press and the}} general public were {{pressing}} for production of the Syrena Sport. Two state-owned companies even declared readiness to manufacture fibreglass bodies. This was in turn an uncomfortable situation for the management of the FSO and the government, which never intended to mass-produce the Sport. A frequently quoted (although not fully substantiated) story says that either the Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz [...] or the First Secretary of the Communist Party Władysław Gomułka [...] personally called the factory and ordered <b>to</b> <b>moth-ball</b> the project. Until that moment, the car had driven some 29,000 km on the factory test track and on public roads outside of the FSO, and generally proved to be adequately designed. After that intervention, tests were abandoned and the car was stored in a garage at the Development Centre in Warszawa-Falenica. Following a mindless decision, it was purposefully destroyed in the late 1970s together with a number of other FSO prototypes, in order to free up garage space.|$|E
