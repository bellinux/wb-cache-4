500|$|Jesse Eisenberg's {{breakthrough}} {{starring role}} was in Zombieland. The horror-comedy, which saw him with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a sleeper hit. In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg {{in the film}} The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role {{as soon as they}} watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition. On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year. On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared. Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was [...] "an overwhelming experience," [...] and was happy that [...] "we were both able to have fun at the situation." [...] Zuckerberg, who has been a vocal disser on the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg [...] "was a little afraid <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice." ...|$|E
500|$|A cover {{version of}} [...] "September Gurls" [...] {{appeared}} on the Bangles' 1986 triple platinum album Different Light. [...] "September Gurls", Borack wrote, [...] "was and is {{the sine qua non}} of power pop, a glorious, glittering jewel with every facet cut and shined to absolute perfection.... a peerless, aching distillation of love and longing. 'September Gurls' may not actually be the greatest song ever recorded, but for the duration of its 2:47 running time, you can be forgiven for believing it is." [...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album Pleased <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others. Lucero, a Memphis, Tennessee-based alternative country band, covered [...] "I'm In Love With a Girl" [...] on their 2015 release All a Man Should Do, an album which takes its title from a lyric in the song. Founding member Jody Stephens, and later additions to Big Star, provide backup on the track.|$|E

Much to Jephthah's dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah did as he had vowed, but [...] "shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., Radak) to suggest {{that she was not}} actually killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, The Bangles {{released}} {{their second}} LP, Different Light, which contained a cover version of Chilton's Big Star song [...] "September Gurls".

The following year, his visibility increased in the alternative rock scene when he was the subject of the song [...] "Alex Chilton" [...] by American rock band The Replacements on their album Pleased <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> <b>Me,</b> on which Chilton was a guest musician playing guitar on the song [...] "Can't Hardly Wait".|$|E

When a Mandarin explained that the Chinese wanted peace, Gough notes in his official report: [...] "I had it explained that, as General commanding the British, I would treat with none but the General commanding the Chinese troops, that we came before Canton much against the wishes of the British nation, but that repeated insults and breaches of faith had compelled us to make the present movement, and that I would cease from hostilities for two hours to enable their General <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse."

2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet {{him at the door}} when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me,</b> when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, [...] "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which [...] "he [...] did to her as he had vowed." [...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me.</b> I got off the train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E

2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{can also}} have the intention of winning the gods' favour in warfare. In Homeric legend, Iphigeneia was to be sacrificed by her father Agamemnon to appease Artemis so she would allow the Greeks to wage the Trojan War. According to the Bible, Jephthah vowed to devote to God the first creature {{to come out of}} his house to meet him if he won the battle against the Ammonites. Judges 11:30-31; [...] "And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me,</b> when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will Him a burnt offering." [...] His daughter was the first to come out and meet him. Judges 11:34; [...] "And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter." [...] Although there is some uncertainty as to whether this was human sacrifice or consecration, academia discusses this in the context of human sacrifice, drawing parallels to Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac.|$|E
2500|$|Starting on February 23, the Confederate forces reached Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13, but due {{to their}} slow advance they failed to capture most of the Union {{supplies}} located at these cities. The slow advance also allowed reinforcements from Colorado {{under the command of}} Colonel John Slough to reach Fort Union. Since he had been commissioned colonel before Paul was commissioned the same rank, Slough claimed seniority and took command of the fort. Canby had already ordered Paul to [...] "not move from Fort Union <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> until I advise you of the route and point of junction." [...] After learning of the change in command, Canby told Slough to [...] "advise me of your plans and movements, that I may cooperate." [...] He also instructed Slough to [...] "harass the enemy by partisan operations. Obstruct his movements and cut off his supplies." [...] Slough interpreted this as an authorization to advance, which he did with [...] men from the fort's garrison. The Union and Confederate forces met at the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force through the pass, but had to retreat following the destruction of their wagon train, which contained nearly all of their supplies and ammunition. Sibley pulled his army back to Albuquerque to await reinforcements from Texas. Slough, receiving orders from Canby to return immediately to Fort Union, also retreated, fearing a court martial if he disobeyed this order. Once he arrived at the fort, he resigned his commission and returned to Colorado, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Tappan in command of the regiment and Paul in command of the fort.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
