5|$|Peter brings Simpson {{home with}} him to meet the family, who are {{initially}} less tolerant of Simpson than Peter. Brian tries to tell Peter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> trust Simpson just because he idolized him as a child but Peter refuses.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{died during}} the Siege of Syracuse {{when he was killed}} by a Roman soldier despite orders <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be harmed. Cicero {{describes}} visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias {{and several of}} Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry {{the daughter of a}} Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.|$|E
6000|$|And with a great, musical roll of {{his voice}} he went {{swinging}} off into the darkness again, as if his thoughts had lent him wings. He was dreaming of the inspiration of foreign lands,--of castled crags and historic landscapes. What a pity, after all, thought Rowland, as he went his own way, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>n't</b> have a taste of it! ...|$|R
25|$|On Why I Fired Them, Sir Alan {{reflected}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> probably <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{have given}} so many chances to Michael and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was drawn in by his youth, even acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not always}} get it right.|$|R

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Revithi {{arrived at}} the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9April , where the athletes had already {{assembled}} for the following day's race. She {{attracted the attention of}} the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of seven men and five women, including one Afro-Caribbean woman. They were not {{told that it}} was Silcott's fourth murder trial, {{that he had been}} out on bail for the murder of Anthony Smith when Blakelock was killed, or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder. Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{there the}} holy man a-read him right godly doctrine, and shrived him, {{and gave him}} an oath upon the blessed Gospels, <b>that</b> fight <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not,</b> save in his liege lord's quarrel, {{for a year and}} a day. And there he abode till he was well healed, he and his horse.' ...|$|R

"It is most {{singularly}} odd <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{have undertaken}} <b>that</b> long voyage to England to wrest thence just those two captives; <b>that</b> being there <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have raided in true corsair fashion and packed his ship with slaves. Most singularly odd!" ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} afternoon Vincent {{told his mother}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going over that evening to his friend Furniss, as an early start was to be made next morning; they intended {{to go down the}} river as far as Yorktown, if <b>not</b> further; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> certainly <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be back for two days, and probably might be even longer.|$|R
5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> abandon Troy {{and that she}} should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
60|$|But {{after several}} debates between ourselves, {{he came to}} this resolution, viz., <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would travel incognito, and so <b>he</b> <b>should</b> avoid all public notice either of himself or of who went with him; and <b>that</b> then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only carry me with him, but have a perfect leisure of enjoying my {{agreeable}} company (as he was pleased to call it) all the way.|$|R
50|$|As {{counties}} {{were represented}} {{in that era}} by their champion clubs, Tipperary was represented by Arravale Rovers while Pierce O'Mahony's club from Navan played for Meath. Tipp won, with all four of its points scored by Willie Ryan. The referee later admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have <b>not</b> awarded one of Tipperary's points, but Meath sportingly {{did not ask for}} a replay.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{broke off}} {{as his father}} advanced, and gave her the letter itself to read. Mr. Wilmot {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> certainly <b>should</b> <b>not</b> refuse such a boy as Harry, on the proof of such entire penitence and deep feeling. Whether {{to bring him to}} the further privilege might be another question; but, as far as the Confirmation was concerned, the opinion was decided.|$|R
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, who argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E
6000|$|... "The pay of such {{a service}} should be both generous and punctual, and the cheer of the most {{encouraging}} character," [...] the good-man observed, in a way <b>that</b> manifested <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be displeased were he to receive a reply. Fid was in no disposition to balk his curiosity, but rather deemed himself bound, since he had once entered on the subject, to leave {{no part of it}} in obscurity.|$|R
60|$|Lady Moulton was silenced, but not convinced; however, she {{had good}} sense enough {{to drop the}} subject. General Mathieson had already told her <b>that</b> {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> interfere in any way with any choice Hilda might make, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> make it an absolute condition that she <b>should</b> <b>not</b> marry until she came of age; and as she was at present but eighteen, many things might occur in the three years' interval.|$|R
50|$|Torvalds {{attempted}} {{to end the}} discussion at that point, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have overreacted to Tanenbaum's initial statements, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was composing a personal e-mail to him to apologize. However, he would continue the debate at a later time.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, Marthandan {{arrives at}} Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks {{him to stay}} in an {{isolated}} palace on the outskirts and tells him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of the pathetic state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon as he takes charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. He carries out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees {{to do so in the}} interests of the state, and arrives just in time for the coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him.|$|E
25|$|Moses was {{supposed}} to receive the priesthood along with {{the leadership of the}} Jewish people, but when he argued with God <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be the leader, God then chose Aaron as the recipient of the priesthood.|$|E
25|$|The work theorizes {{that all}} people have self-destructive tendencies, {{including}} the narrator. The narrator's ultimate confession as a murderer is not inspired by any feelings of guilt but, instead, from a desire to publicize his actions despite knowing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Nigerian {{ambassador}} to the UNHRC, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> Council <b>should</b> <b>not</b> dilute its efforts by vilifying the Fact-Finding Mission members {{and parts of the}} report – no useful purpose would be served by compounding the human rights situation in the region through sheer rhetoric or failure to act. He said, [...] "The implementation of the report was crucial to addressing the pernicious issues of impunity and accountability".|$|R
5000|$|Sheila Buckley, whose {{daughter}} Maxine {{played a major}} part in securing Kiszko's conviction, criticised the police for not arresting him earlier and told the Manchester Evening News that [...] ".. children are a lot safer now this monster has been put away". She also demanded Kiszko's hanging. Even Albert Wright, Kiszko's solicitor, thought that his client was guilty {{but that it was}} a case of diminished responsibility and <b>that</b> therefore <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been convicted outright of murder.|$|R
5000|$|Thein Han (painter) (သိန်းဟန်, 1910-1986) {{was a major}} Yangon {{painter of}} the post-World War II era who {{produced}} a number of memorable works and who had an abiding influence {{on the evolution of}} the more conservative painting styles in Burma in the decades <b>that</b> followed. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be confused with Thein Han the writer and art critic, who is often quoted for his article written on Burmese painting published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1958.|$|R
25|$|The {{historian}} Pei Songzhi criticised Man Chong for his {{cruelty and}} said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have tortured Yang Biao, {{who had a}} reputation for being virtuous. From his viewpoint, even though Man Chong deserved praise for doing things by the book, it was not enough to make up for his cruelty.|$|E
25|$|The Qianlong Emperor {{rejected}} {{the views of}} Han officials who said Xinjiang {{was not part of}} China and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> conquer it, putting forth the view that China was multiethnic and did not just refer to Han. The Qianlong Emperor compared his achievements with that of the Han and Tang ventures into Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|According to {{some analysts}} and {{campaign}} aides, Davis' {{town hall meetings}} and conversations with voters were softening his image. Many political insiders remarked that Davis had made several comebacks and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be counted {{out of the race}} despite poll numbers that showed over 50% planning to vote yes on the recall.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010, Contador {{revealed}} that a urine sample he had given on July 21, a rest day in the Tour de France, had contained traces of clenbuterol. He has stated, due {{to the number of}} other tests <b>he</b> passed and <b>that</b> only a tiny amount of the substance was detected in the one <b>he</b> failed, <b>that</b> food contamination was to blame. Renowned anti-doping doctor Don Catlin considered this explanation plausible. Contador stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the victim, and he can [...] "hold his head high" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be punished. Several people related to the sport said that there is little benefit from using the drug, especially in the amounts that were discovered.|$|R
60|$|Tom's father {{intended}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> study medicine, <b>not</b> {{with a view}} to practising it professionally, {{but because}} he held it to be very desirable that every one travelling in the unhealthy regions of South Africa should possess as much knowledge of medicine as possible.|$|R
