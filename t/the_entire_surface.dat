5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> is a union of such circles.|$|E
5|$|After the war the {{greyhound}} company introduced floodlights and in 1958 <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> required relaying {{after the}} Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council {{announced that a}} revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch greyhound racing to nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives {{the motion of the}} filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E

5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E

Mucous glands cover <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated. There are many other functions of the mucous glands such as controlling the pH, thermoregulation, adhesive properties to the environment, anti-predator behaviors (slimy to the grasp), chemical communication, even anti-bacterial/viral properties for protection against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Inter-crater plains are {{the oldest}} visible surface, predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and {{occur in the}} regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30km in diameter. It {{is not clear whether}} they are of {{volcanic}} or impact origin. The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the planet.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{formation of the}} state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.|$|E
25|$|The beaker came {{in various}} sizes from 8 to 50cm high and from 5 to 20cm in diameter. Decoration filled <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> with {{horizontal}} bands of fingertip or fingernail impressions. It {{must have been}} in the decoration phase that grains of wheat and barley left their impression in the clay. Late in the period technique and decoration became slightly more varied and sophisticated: the walls were thinner and different motifs were used in the impressions: chevrons, cord marks, and punctures made with animal bones. Handles are sometimes added and the rims may turn in instead of out.|$|E
25|$|The optics to {{distribute}} {{the light in the}} desired pattern are designed into the reflector itself, rather than into the lens. Depending on the development tools and techniques in use, the reflector may be engineered from the start as a bespoke shape, or it may start as a parabola standing in for {{the size and shape of}} the completed package. In the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> area is modified so as to produce individual segments of specifically calculated, complex contours. The shape of each segment is designed such that their cumulative effect produces the required light distribution pattern.|$|E

25|$|Like human teeth, whale teeth have polyp-like {{protrusions}} {{located on}} the root surface of the tooth. These polyps are made of cementum in both species, but in human teeth, the protrusions are {{located on the}} outside of the root, while in whales the nodule is located on the inside of the pulp chamber. While the roots of human teeth are made of cementum on the outer surface, whales have cementum on <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the tooth with a very small layer of enamel at the tip. This small enamel layer is only seen in older whales where the cementum has been worn away to show the underlying enamel.|$|E
25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>surface</b> of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E
