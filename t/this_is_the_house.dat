500|$|In 1863, Evans {{employed}} Walter Crane {{to illustrate}} covers for inexpensive novels sold in railroad stations called [...] "yellow backs"—after their yellow covers. In 1865, {{they began to}} collaborate on toy books of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Between 1865 and 1876, Crane and Evans produced two or three toybooks a year. The earliest of the series (which grew in popularity) showed only two colours—red and blue—with black or blue used for the key block. Crane illustrated the early books, printed by Evans, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> That Jack Built and Sing a Song of Sixpence, in which the simple designs are presented without background ornamentation and printed only in red, blue and black. Between 1865 and 1886, Crane illustrated 50 toybooks, {{all of which were}} engraved and printed by Evans. These commercially successful books established Crane {{as one of the most}} popular illustrators of children's books in England.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E

50|$|As {{inflation}} is generally understood and {{perceived as the}} rise in price of 'ordinary' goods and services, and official and Central bank policies in most of today’s world have been expressly directed at minimizing 'price inflation', assets inflation has not <b>been</b> <b>the</b> object of much attention or concern.

How many pay undue respect to buildings in which public prayer is offered up? It is the worship that consecrates the place and solemnizes the mind. Very remarkably was this the case with Jacob while wandering in the open wilderness. He put stones for his pillow, and in a dream saw the angels visiting the earth, and said, <b>THIS</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of God, and the gate of heaven.--Ed.|$|E
