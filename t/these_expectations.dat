25|$|Ben-Matityahu had Yodfat's limited {{supply of}} water rationed before the siege began. The Romans had heard of this and began to use their {{artillery}} to target efforts to draw water, hoping to exacerbate an already difficult situation and bring a swift end to the siege. The Jews confounded <b>these</b> <b>expectations</b> by wringing out their clothes over the battlements until the walls were running with water, leading the Romans to believe they had some hidden {{supply of water}}.

The best water committees meet regularly, closely interact with the community, regularly collect revenues, hire a plumber who performs routine repairs, have a bank account and are registered and approved by DINEPA. However, many water committees fall short of <b>these</b> <b>expectations.</b> There is no national or regional registry of water committees or water systems {{and there are no}} associations of water committees at the municipal, departmental or national level.

25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with <b>these</b> <b>expectations</b> is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E

Forced labour of the peasants by the zamindars became more prevalent as cash crops were cultivated to meet the Company revenue demands. Although commercialised cultivation was not new to the region, it had now penetrated deeper into village society and made it more vulnerable to market forces. The zamindars themselves were often unable to meet the increased demands that the Company had placed on them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of their lands were auctioned during the first three decades following the permanent settlement. The new owners were often Brahmin and Kayastha employees of the Company who had a good grasp of the new system, and, in many cases, some had prospered under it.|$|E
