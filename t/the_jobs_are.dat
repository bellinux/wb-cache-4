2500|$|By the 1960s, however, Fleetwood {{began to}} decline economically. The last ferry to the Isle of Man sailed in 1961. The sailings have been revived {{periodically}} since. The main railway station was closed in 1966 {{as a result of}} the Beeching cuts, and the passenger terminus was moved to Wyre Dock railway station. This in turn was closed in 1970, as the branch line from Poulton was taken out of service. Additional light industry developed along the former railway bed. The rise of package holidays abroad led to fewer visitors generally to British resort towns. As Blackpool expanded its attractions, fewer day visitors came to Fleetwood, and as transport became more efficient, more overnight visitors became day visitors. The Hillhouse plant was heavily cut back, and was finally closed in 1999. Most serious, however, was the collapse of the fishing industry, which was largely destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the Cod Wars, a dispute over fishing rights between Iceland and the UK. As Fleetwood's trawlers mainly fished the North Atlantic in search of cod, the loss of the fishing grounds hit the town hard. The last deep sea trawler left the town in 1982 and now only inshore fishing boats fish out of the port, although trawlers registered in other places can still be seen taking advantage of the fish market. Fish is still a big industry in the town, though <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> mainly in processing rather than fishing. A pair of bronze [...] on the promenade by the pier depicts the idea of families welcoming back the fishermen from sea.|$|E
