5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone begins <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> {{back into}} the colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E

5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle <b>to</b> <b>tilt.</b> If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E

5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient {{that had previously been}} used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E

25|$|Tilt of the {{waveplate}} enters via {{a factor}} of 1/costhinsp&θ (where θ is the angle of tilt) into the path length and thus only quadratically into the phase. For the extraordinary polarization the tilt also changes the refractive index to the ordinary via {{a factor of}} costhinsp&θ, so combined with the path length, the phase shift for the extraordinary light due <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> is zero.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} occurs when, {{because of}} the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.|$|E

25|$|The Arabian Peninsula is {{an ancient}} massif {{composed}} of stable crystalline rock whose geologic structure developed concurrently with the Alps. Geologic movements caused the entire mass <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> eastward and the western and southern edges <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> upward. In the valley created by the fault, called the Great Rift, the Red Sea was formed. The Great Rift runs from the Mediterranean along {{both sides of the}} Red Sea south through Ethiopia and the lake country of East Africa, gradually disappearing in the area of Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Scientists analyzing photographs taken by United States astronauts on the joint United States-Soviet space mission in July 1975 detected a vast fan-shaped complex of cracks and fault lines extending north and east from the Golan Heights. These fault lines are believed to be the northern and final portion of the Great Rift and are presumed {{to be the result of}} the slow rotation of the Arabian Peninsula counterclockwise in a way that will, in approximately 10 million years, close off the Persian Gulf and make it a lake.|$|E
25|$|The theatre sits upon {{shifting}} ground {{and is in}} danger of collapse. The first cracks in the foundation appeared almost as soon as the theatre opened. The theatre's eastern half sagged almost seven inches in its first three years, and the six walls began <b>to</b> <b>tilt.</b> Gleb Dranov, a former opera singer who sang at the theatre for 25 years, and who worked five years as a geologist, is helping repair the building.|$|E
25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial frames of reference. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer <b>to</b> <b>tilt</b> their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.|$|E
40|$|To {{examine how}} anesthetized dogs {{compensate}} for the diaphragmatic shortening that occurs during head-up tilting, we measured the electroneurogram (ENG) of the C 5 phrenic root and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the parasternal intercostal and transversus abdominis muscles in eight spontaneously breathing animals during postural changes between supine (0 °) and 80 ° head-up. Both steady state ENG and EMG activities and first breath responses <b>to</b> <b>tilting</b> from 80 ° head-up to supine were studied. These experiments have shown that: (1) anesthetized dogs respond <b>to</b> head-up <b>tilting</b> by increasing the neural drive to the costal diaphragm and parasternal intercostals; (2) this response, however, does not occur on the first breath and therefore cannot {{compensate for the}} immediate changes in diaphragmatic length; (3) the abdominal muscles, in contrast, show a first breath response <b>to</b> <b>tilting</b> and their activation is primarily responsible {{for the maintenance of}} tidal volume. Unlike in humans, increases in neural inspiratory drive in head-up anesthetized dogs are mediated by a chemoreceptive, rather than proprioceptive, feedback mechanism.
