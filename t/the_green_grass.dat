25|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram above, one method used to {{decrease}} the likelihood of accidental detonation employed metal balls. The balls were emptied into the pit: this prevented detonation by increasing {{the density of the}} hollow pit, thereby preventing symmetrical implosion {{in the event of an}} accident. This design was used in <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> weapon, also known as the Interim Megaton Weapon, which was used in the Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bombs.|$|E
25|$|Delays and {{failures}} in the Granite programme and the abandonment of Green Bamboo without a test, left {{a gap in the}} programme and an emergency capability weapon to fill that gap was devised from elements of both Green Bamboo and Orange Herald; being known as Knobkerry, or Green Grass, and the Interim Megaton Weapon. There were also other factors involved in the decision to build an Interim Megaton Weapon. One being that the UK HEU production programme was by 1957 producing quantities of HEU for which there was no immediate need; and the Chiefs of Staff were reluctant to see it continue to languish in stores, unused for weapons, when it was being produced at great cost. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> warhead containing perhaps 70–86kg of HEU (although there are no reliable declassified sources for this figure) was therefore hurriedly produced and installed in a modified Blue Danube casing, to be known as Violet Club, until a better solution based on the Yellow Sun casing could be produced, known then with Green Grass installed, as Yellow Sun Mk.1. Only five Violet Club weapons were produced, known by the RAF description of Bomb, Aircraft, HE 9,000lb HC, and they were stripped of their Green Grass warheads for transfer to the better casings when these became available.|$|E

500|$|Soon after, {{inspired}} by the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night, the band decided to equip themselves with similar instruments to the Fab Four: a Rickenbacker twelve-string guitar for McGuinn, a Ludwig drum kit for Clarke, and a Gretsch Tennessean guitar for Clark (although Crosby commandeered it soon after, resulting in Clark switching to tambourine). [...] In October 1964, Dickson recruited mandolin player Chris Hillman as the Jet Set's bassist. [...] Hillman's background was more oriented towards country music than folk or rock, having {{been a member of}} the bluegrass groups the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers, the Hillmen (also known as the Golden State Boys), and, concurrently with his recruitment into the Jet Set, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> Group.|$|E
500|$|As part of Britain's {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, the Vulcan initially carried Britain's first nuclear weapon, the Blue Danube gravity bomb. Blue Danube was a low-kiloton yield {{fission bomb}} designed before the United States detonated the first hydrogen bomb. These were supplemented by U.S.-owned Mk 5 bombs (made available under the Project E programme) {{and later by}} the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. The UK had previously embarked on its own hydrogen bomb programme, and {{to bridge the gap}} until these were ready the V-bombers were equipped with an Interim Megaton Weapon based on the Blue Danube casing containing Green Grass, a large pure-fission warhead of [...] yield. This bomb was known as Violet Club. Only five were deployed before <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Grass</b> warhead was incorporated into a developed weapon as Yellow Sun Mk.1.|$|E
