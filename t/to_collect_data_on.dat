25|$|Before {{the early}} 1910s, {{there was no}} system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions, most likely because they weren't {{considered}} a serious threat as ships had managed to survive even direct crashes. In 1907, SS Kronprinz Wilhelm, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but {{was still able to}} complete her voyage. The April 1912 sinking of the Titanic however changed all that, and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, ocean temperature, and salinity levels. They published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.|$|E

On 21 March 2016 the Manned Space Engineering Office announced that they had disabled data service, since the space station had operated two and half years longer than its intended two-year service plan. According to the office, the space laboratory is under continued and close monitoring until it finally burns up in the earth atmosphere. Its orbit will descend gradually in the coming months, and the space laboratory will eventually be destroyed by heat in Earth's atmosphere between the October 2017 and April 2018 Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, among others, told The Guardian that parts of the craft such as the rocket engines are probably too dense and tough to be burnt up upon re-entry and may result in chunks of debris up 100kg in weight falling to the Earth's surface, with little possibility of predicting where they may crash.|$|E
25|$|Capable of {{conducting}} multidisciplinary oceanographic operations {{in support of}} biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Oscar Dyson was commissioned as {{the first of a}} class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 1,800 meters (5,905 feet). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20km/hr).|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} time that the stratigraphic column was being completed, imperialism drove several {{countries}} in the early to mid 19th century to explore distant lands to expand their empires. This gave naturalists the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>on</b> these voyages. In 1831 Captain Robert FitzRoy, given charge of the coastal survey expedition of HMS Beagle, sought a suitable naturalist to examine the land and give geological advice. This fell to Charles Darwin, who had just completed his BA degree and had accompanied Sedgwick on a two-week Welsh mapping expedition after taking his Spring course on geology. Fitzroy gave Darwin Lyell’s Principles of Geology, and Darwin became Lyell's first disciple, inventively theorising on uniformitarian principles about the geological processes he saw, and challenging some of Lyell's ideas. He speculated about the Earth expanding to explain uplift, then on the basis of the idea that ocean areas sank as land was uplifted, theorised that coral atolls grew from fringing coral reefs round sinking volcanic islands. This idea was confirmed when the Beagle surveyed the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and in 1842 he published his theory on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. Darwin's discovery of giant fossils helped to establish his reputation as a geologist, and his theorising about the causes of their extinction led to his theory of evolution by natural selection published in On the Origin of Species in 1859.|$|E
