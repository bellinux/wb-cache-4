5|$|While he was {{a student}} at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"); it is {{described}} in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert.

5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> <b>between</b> knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E

Finally new classes of examples of paracontact manifolds are presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. <b>The</b> <b>interplay</b> <b>between</b> these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> <b>between</b> the three essential {{components of a}} manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
