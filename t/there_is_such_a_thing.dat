25|$|The biblical {{concept of}} righteousness {{was rooted in}} the covenant-making God who had ordered {{creation}} for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern {{for the poor and}} needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31).

Satan {{raises the question of whether}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "Pixar's ninth {{consecutive}} wonder", {{saying it was}} imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that {{the main difference between}} the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL-E surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the [...] "heart, soul, spirit and romance" [...] of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings.

2500|$|One {{attempt to}} define {{goodness}} {{describes it as}} a property {{of the world with}} transcendental realism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. [...] The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. [...] The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists {{in the mind of the}} Divine, or some heavenly realm. [...] The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. [...] The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.|$|E

2500|$|What survives through writing {{represents}} {{primarily the}} register of Anglo-Saxon, {{and this is}} most often in the West Saxon dialect. Little {{is known about the}} everyday spoken language of people living in the migration period. Old English is a contact language and it is hard to reconstruct the pidgin used in this period from the written language found in the West Saxon literature of some 400 years later. Two general theories are proposed regarding why people changed their language to Old English (or an early form of such): either, a person or household changed so as to serve an elite; or, a person or household changed through choice as it provided some advantage economically or legally. Over time, Old English developed into four major dialects: Northumbrian, spoken north of the river Humber; Mercian, spoken in the Midlands; Kentish, spoken in Kent in the far southeastern part of the island; and West Saxon, spoken in the southwest. All of these dialects have direct descendants in modern England, and American regional dialects also have their roots in the dialects of Old English.

2500|$|The main crisis {{came when}} a German u-boat sank the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania in May 1915. International law {{required}} a warning so that {{passengers and crew}} could board life boats. [...] No warning was issued and the ship sank in 18 minutes, with a thousand deaths including over 100 Americans. Wilson said, [...] "There {{is such a thing}} as a man being too proud to fight. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right". Many reacted to these remarks with contempt. Wilson protested to Berlin but its reply was evasive. Secretary of State Bryan, strongly opposed to war, resigned, and was replaced by Robert Lansing. The White Star liner the SS Arabic was then torpedoed, with two American casualties. Wilson threatened a diplomatic break unless Germany repudiated the action; Germany then gave a written promise: [...] "liners will not be sunk by our submarines". Wilson had won a promise that merchant ships would not be sunk without warning; and most importantly he had kept the U.S. out of the war. Meanwhile, Wilson requested and received funds in the final 1916 appropriations bill to provide for 500,000 troops. It also included a five-year Navy plan for major construction of battleships, cruisers, destroyers and submarines—showing Wilson's dedication to a big Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{to direct the}} film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson. She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson {{at a dinner party}} or a social gathering, [...] "it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument about who they were. I mean, they were very controversial– and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that." [...] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne. The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives. [...] "I was sitting in a room that was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying {{to understand the nature of}} their love story and trying to figure out for myself if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as perfect love," [...] she said. However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: [...] "We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' but to say, 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created." ...|$|E
