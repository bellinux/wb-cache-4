5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase {{once it is}} <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it {{is most likely to}} run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E

50|$|The Paracas Candelabra, {{also called}} the Candelabra of the Andes, is a {{well-known}} prehistoric geoglyph found on the northern face of the Paracas Peninsula at Pisco Bay in Peru. Pottery found nearby has been radio carbon dated to 200 BCE, {{the time of the}} Paracas culture. The design is cut two feet into the soil, with stones possibly from a later date placed around it. The figure is 595 feet <b>tall,</b> large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be seen 12 miles at sea.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known examples of companion planting is the growing of rice with Azolla, the mosquito fern, which covers {{the top of a}} fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{wind tunnel}} study came into its own: the effects of wind on man made {{structures}} or objects needed to be studied when buildings became <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> present large surfaces to the wind, and the resulting forces had to be resisted by the building's internal structure. Determining such forces was required before building codes could specify the required strength of such buildings and such tests continue {{to be used for}} large or unusual buildings.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{most state}} and local laws {{regarding}} the required number and placement of smoke detectors are based upon standards established in NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code. Laws governing the installation of smoke detectors {{vary depending on the}} locality. However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working smoke detector on every level. The United States NFPA code cited in the previous paragraph requires smoke detectors on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow access. Many other countries have comparable requirements.|$|E

40|$|Summary of {{experiments}} {{for the investigation}} of a fire which caused an upward fire spread for over 12 floors through balconies in a high-rise apartment complex is reported. The experiments include indoor tests to obtain fire properties of vertical PMMA fences and outdoor tests with a full scale model of the balcony. The test results suggest significance of the increase of total flame height through merging of flames and cooperative effect of the burning of PMMA fences and combustibles on the balconies for the generation of a <b>tall</b> flame <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause ignition on the upper floor...|$|R
50|$|Anphans: The Next's {{original}} form, {{which is}} an analogous to Ultraman Type A and Nexus' Anphans. Because of his incomplete merging, The Next is only 10 meters <b>tall,</b> which was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> face The One in Reputiria stage. The Next's fighting style {{involves the use of}} brute strength and normal physical attacks. His only ranged attack is , which launches energy blade projection.|$|R
25|$|However, {{only certain}} types of {{structures}} are vulnerable to this resonance effect. Taller buildings have their own frequencies of vibration. Those that are six to fifteen stories tall also vibrate at the 2.5-second cycle, making them act like tuning forks {{in the event of}} an earthquake. The low-frequency waves of an earthquake are amplified by the mud of the lakebed, which in turn, is amplified by the building itself. This causes these buildings to shake more violently than the earthquake proper as the earthquake progresses. Many of the older colonial buildings have survived hundreds of years on the lakebed simply because they are not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be affected by the resonance effect.|$|E
25|$|Palms inhabit {{a variety}} of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> form part of the canopy and shorter ones form part of the understory. Some species form pure stands in areas with poor {{drainage}} or regular flooding, including Raphia hookeri which is common in coastal freshwater swamps in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above 1000m, {{such as those in}} the genus Ceroxylon native to the Andes. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert oases such as the date palm. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme potassium deficiency and toxicity of heavy metals in serpentine soils.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant to go against Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, the {{decision}} was made to start the construction of a fixed-span bridge that was <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> for sailboats <b>to</b> pass under. After this bridge was finished, Highway 146 was linked all the way from Galveston to Texas State Highway 225. This spurred a further increase in the population of Seabrook to its present level of nearly 12,000 people. Seabrook's residents are quite diversified and are employed in a variety of professional positions. Quite a few residents have ties to the chemical and oil industry as well as the NASA space program.|$|R
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E

He was offered an apprenticeship by Portsmouth, but turned it down as he wanted to sign for his local club Stoke City, who initially were not willing to take him on as an apprentice. They only allowed him to train with the 'A' team twice a week as an amateur whilst he initially worked as a plumber's mate, and later as a factory worker at Stone Lotus.|$|E
500|$|Mauna Loa is <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have {{experienced}} glaciation {{during the last}} ice age, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago. Unlike Mauna Kea, on which extensive evidence of glaciation remains even today, Mauna Loa {{was at the time}} and has remained active, having grown an additional [...] in height since then and covering any glacial deposits beneath new flows; strata of that age doesn't occur until at least [...] down from the volcano's summit, too low for glacial growth. Mauna Loa also lacks its neighbor's summit permafrost region, although sporadic ice persists in places. It is speculated that extensive phreatomagmatic activity occurred during this time, contributing extensively to ash deposits on the summit.|$|E
50|$|The first grenades {{were small}} iron spheres filled with {{gunpowder}} fused with {{a length of}} slow-match, {{roughly the size of}} a baseball. The grenadiers had to be <b>tall</b> and strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hurl these heavy objects far enough so as not to harm themselves or their comrades, and disciplined <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stand {{at the forefront of the}} fight, light the fuse and throw at the appropriate moment to minimize the ability of an enemy to throw the grenade back. Understandably, such requirements led to grenadiers being regarded as an elite fighting force.|$|R

Despite wearing business suits, her character was known to climb {{on top of the}} announcers' table and dance sensually. It was also during this period that she began using what would become her trademark ring entrance: slowly putting her forty-two inch legs through the second tier of ropes, pausing to let the crowd momentarily see her panties. At 5feet 11inches, Keibler was one of few women in professional wrestling <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> step over the middle of the three ropes that surround the ring.|$|E

500|$|Japan employs both analog {{and digital}} broadcasting, but by July 2011 all {{television}} broadcasting {{is to be}} digital. Tokyo Tower is not a reliable broadcasting antenna for completely digital broadcasting because the tower is not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> transmit the higher frequency waves to areas surrounded by forests or high-rise buildings. As an alternative, a new 634-metre-tall (2,080ft) tower called the Tokyo Skytree was opened in 2012. To make Tokyo Tower more appealing to NHK and five other commercial broadcasters who plan to move their transmitting stations to the new tower, Nihon Denpatō officials drafted a plan to extend its digital broadcasting antenna by 80to100metres {{at a cost of}} approximately ¥4billion (US$50 million). Because these plans have not been realized, Tokyo Tower is expected to stop transmitting digital TV radio waves with the exception of Open University of Japan, who will continue to broadcast through the tower. FM radio stations will also continue to use the tower for broadcasting in the Tokyo area. Masahiro Kawada, the tower's planning director, also pointed out the possibility of the tower becoming a backup for the Tokyo Skytree, depending on what the TV broadcasters want or need.|$|E
500|$|Maggie {{dreams that}} the entire family has become puppets in a theater. As the Simpsons prepare {{for a trip to}} Hawaii and ask Moe to house-sit for them, Homer's boss Mr. Burns pays a {{surprise}} visit. He soon learns that Homer has feigned a neck injury to get time off work for the trip and calls his attack hounds on him. However, only one arrives (represented by a crude sock puppet), since the show has spent its budget on Katy Perry, who appears as herself and Moe's girlfriend. Noticing that Burns is disappointed by the lack of his attack hounds, Katy gives him a kiss. Touched by this, Burns decides to forgive the Simpsons and allows them to enjoy their trip in Hawaii, and then everyone sings a parody of [...] "Twelve Days of Christmas" [...] which plays during the credits. At the end of the credits, Moe attempts to kiss Katy but is not <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> reach her mouth, so he instead opts to kiss her bellybutton through her dress. Katy retorts that he is not kissing her bellybutton, meaning that he is actually kissing her vulva, but also says she did not tell Moe to stop.|$|E
500|$|The {{time span}} and {{geographic}} range of Edmontosaurus overlapped with Tyrannosaurus, and an adult specimen of E. annectens {{on display in}} the Denver Museum of Nature and Science shows evidence of a theropod bite in the tail. Counting back from the hip, the thirteenth to seventeenth vertebrae have damaged spines consistent with an attack from the right rear of the animal. One spine has a portion sheared away, and the others are kinked; three have apparent tooth puncture marks. The top of the tail was at least [...] high, and the only theropod species known from the same rock formation that was <b>tall</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make such an attack is T. rex. The bones are partially healed, but the edmontosaur died before the traces of damage were completely obliterated. The damage also shows signs of bone infection. Kenneth Carpenter, who studied the specimen, noted that there also seems to be a healed fracture in the left hip which predated the attack because it was more fully healed. He suggested that the edmontosaur was a target because it may have been limping from this earlier injury. Because it survived the attack, Carpenter suggested that it may have outmaneuvered or outrun its attacker, or that the damage to its tail was incurred by the hadrosaurid using it as a weapon against the tyrannosaur.|$|E
60|$|Ruth was twenty-four, perhaps, or twenty-five. Not <b>tall,</b> slight <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> nestle, {{but strong}} and self-reliant.

When she laughed, Carl noted, Ruth had a trick of lifting her heavy lids quickly, and surprising one with a glint of blue eyes where brown were expected. Her smooth, healthy, cream-colored skin was rosy with winter, and looked as though in summer it would tan evenly, without freckles. Her chin was soft, but without a dimple, and her jaws had a clean, boyish leanness. Her smooth neck and delicious shoulders were curved, not fatly, but with youth and happiness. They were square, capable shoulders, with no mid-Victorian droop about them. Her waist was slender naturally, not from stays. Her short but not fat fingers were the ideal instruments for the piano. Slim were her crossed feet, and her unwrinkled pumps (foolish footgear for a snowy evening) seemed eager to dance.|$|R
