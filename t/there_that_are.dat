[...] "That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' ” ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{the choice}} of The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais as winner of the 2008 award was controversial, as Parker did not write the book himself, but used an {{automated}} authoring machine which produces thousands of titles {{on the basis of}} Internet and database searches. Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at The Bookseller, commented by saying: [...] "I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> ghostwritten, I don't think it's too strange." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the game}} {{received}} high praise overall, certain publications voiced complaints. Hatfield {{noted that the}} cutscenes had low production values, stating that [...] "they don't have the polish {{of the rest of}} the game". The reviewer for PC Gamer mentioned [...] "a few minor, yet-to-be-patched bugs". Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution said that [...] "a lot of the levels in Super Meat Boy depend a little too much on twitch reflexes and trial-and-error memorization". He also stated that [...] "there are some bits of toilet humor here and <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> duds", and that the game's high level of difficulty [...] "will make most casual players shy away". Mitchell Dyer of GamePro agreed, saying that certain [...] "absurdly difficult" [...] levels broke the flow of the game, especially in the boss levels and the later chapters.|$|E

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books out <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a}} little kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E

60|$|Though {{truth and}} {{falsehood}} belong, in propriety of speech, only to PROPOSITIONS: yet IDEAS are oftentimes termed {{true or false}} (as what words are <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not used with great latitude, and with some deviation from their strict and proper significations?) Though I think that when ideas themselves are termed true or false, {{there is still some}} secret or tacit proposition, which is the foundation of that denomination: as we shall see, if we examine the particular occasions wherein they come to be called true or false. In all which we shall find some kind of affirmation or negation, which is the reason of that denomination. For our ideas, being nothing but bare APPEARANCES, or perceptions in our minds, cannot properly and simply in themselves be said to be true or false, no more than a single name of anything can be said to be true or false.|$|E

60|$|Lady Gregory {{has just}} given me her {{beautiful}} Poets and Dreamers, {{and it has}} brought to mind a day {{two or three years}} ago when I stood on the side of Slieve Echtge, looking out over Galway. The Burren Hills were to my left, and though I forget whether I could see the cairn over Bald Conan of the Fianna, I could certainly see many places <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in poems and stories. In front of me, over many miles of level Galway plains, I saw a low blue hill flooded with evening light. I asked a countryman who was with me what hill that was, and he told me it was Cruachmaa of the Sidhe. I had often heard of Cruachmaa of the Sidhe even as far north as Sligo, for the country people have told me a great many stories of the great host of the Sidhe who live there, still fighting and holding festivals.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{meaning of}} the outrages on Orientals," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "is that the financiers have {{introduced}} Chinese labor into this country with the deliberate intention of reducing workmen and peasants to starvation. Our unhappy politicians have made concession after concession; {{and now they are}} asking concessions which amount to our ordering a massacre of our own poor. If we do not fight now we shall never fight again. They will have put England in an economic position of starving in a week. But we are going to fight now; I shouldn't wonder if there were an ultimatum in a week and an invasion in a fortnight. All the past corruption and cowardice is hampering us, of course; the West country is pretty stormy and doubtful even in a military sense; and the Irish regiments <b>there,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> supposed to support us by the new treaty, are pretty well in mutiny; for, of course, this infernal coolie capitalism is being pushed in Ireland, too. But it's to stop now; and if the government message of reassurance gets through to them in time, they may turn up after all by the time the enemy lands. For my poor old gang is going to stand to its guns at last. Of course it's only natural that when they have been whitewashed for half a century as paragons, their sins should come back on them at the very moment when they are behaving like men {{for the first time in}} their lives. Well, I tell you, March, I know them inside out; and I know they are behaving like heroes. Every man of them ought to have a statue, and on the pedestal words like those of the noblest ruffian of the Revolution: 'Que mon nom soit fletri; que la France soit libre.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to put it in a phrase, but it has been put in this way: <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must <b>be</b> aberration or weakness of mind; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must <b>be</b> some form of mental unsoundness; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must <b>be</b> a state of mind which is bordering on, though not amounting to, insanity; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must <b>be</b> a mind so affected <b>that</b> responsibility <b>is</b> diminished from full responsibility to partial responsibility.
