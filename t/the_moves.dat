5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} tempo on {{the lines of the}} {{previous}} section, making it more difficult for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts.

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E

5|$|For {{security}} reasons, GCHQ {{moved its}} own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. <b>The</b> <b>moves</b> of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E

5|$|The weapon dance employs weapons—or stylized {{versions}} of weapons—traditionally used in combat {{in order to}} simulate, recall, or reenact combat or <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> of combat {{in the form of}} dance, usually for some ceremonial purpose. Such dancing is quite common to folk ritual {{in many parts of the}} world. Weapon dancing is certainly ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the pyrrhic, a weapon dance in ancient Sparta, in which the dance was used as a kind of ritual training for battle.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} goals within the games: {{following}} through the main storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Lance to become the new Champion, and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pokémon by battling other Pokémon, {{which can be found}} in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating experience points (EXP) and leveling up, characteristic and integral to all Pokémon video games, controls the physical properties of the Pokémon, such as the battle statistics acquired, and <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> learned.|$|E

Many other members claim to have endured long-term social, psychological, and spiritual damage, usually stemming from <b>the</b> <b>Move's</b> teachings of complete submission to leadership, whose members have sometimes created an impure and corrupt system.

5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E
5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game {{viewed from}} the third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is visible {{on the screen and}} the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located off the coast of Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E

5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended <b>the</b> <b>moves,</b> citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E
5|$|In March 1777, Scott {{returned}} to his Virginia farm, taking his first furlough {{in more than a}} year.

His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia division, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to major general. With Stephen and Brigadier General William Maxwell ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May 19 and 24. Washington spent much of the summer of 1777 trying to anticipate and counter <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> of British General William Howe, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his seniority and rank had been calculated. After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general George Weedon in seniority.|$|E
