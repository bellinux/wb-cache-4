5|$|After {{multiple}} failures, the Turtle Rock team {{looked for}} a business partner, a company that supported the idea and {{was in need of}} a co-operative shooter to fit into their games lineup. They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as <b>they</b> <b>forgot</b> to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited about the idea. However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline in profits. Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to part with THQ.|$|E

Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia board the teleportation device to be transported back to Filgaia, only to be stopped in mid-voyage by what is left of Zeikfried's body and his spear. The weakened Zeikfried launches a last desperate assault on the heroes, and, though defeated in the end, the energy released in the battle destabilizes the portal. [...] Narrowly escaping through the portal to Filgaia, the trio arrives at Ka Dingel just as it collapses, with Asgard arriving to shield them from the falling debris, but the sheer strain causes great damage to the Earth Golem and so, is later allowed to sleep once more beneath the earth with Cecilia's help.

In a letter she writes to Jack and Rudy, she tells them that she will send them the item <b>they</b> <b>forgot</b> to help them on their future adventures and shows up shortly after to join them on a new quest.|$|E
500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and they obviously weren't getting it. <b>They</b> <b>forgot</b> to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them... it was a horrible experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over.

500|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in development, Todd Ciolek of Anime News Network was unimpressed by Lightning, whom {{he called}} a [...] "businesslike blank". Reviewing the {{finished}} game, Ciolek opined that Lightning is initially [...] "far too distant and cold, as though the writers were so intent on creating a tough, competent heroine that <b>they</b> <b>forgot</b> to make her at all compelling". However, he admitted that Lightning becomes a more appealing lead character by the game's end. Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com simply referred to Lightning as a female version of Cloud. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parrish commented that, barring scenes in which Lightning shows a thoughtful side, she is [...] "your typical, sullen [...] protagonist". Conversely, GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd called Lightning a [...] "likeable, strong-willed beauty". Martin Robinson of IGN UK said that Lightning [...] "instantly endears herself" [...] in comparison with Hope or Snow, but he found that, when Lightning's backstory [...] "gets bogged down in generic swash", Sazh becomes the more appealing character. GamesRadar's Carolyin Gudmundson was unenthusiastic: she opined that, while Lightning's narrative has its merits, it [...] "certainly isn't above and beyond what we'd typically expect". She commented that this lack of originality makes Lightning [...] "one-dimensional and boring". Gamasutra writer Christian Nutt believed that Lightning's relationships with the cast add humanity to the narrative.|$|E

The Allies had established a post close to Markranstädt, and maintained some line of control along the Saale river. This gave Prussia a complement of 22,000 men. [...] On 30 October, the King led the army out of Leipzig, toward Lützen, with Colonel Johann von Mayr and his Freibatallion, an independent unit of 1500 mixed troops, in the lead to flush out Allied pickets and reconnaissance parties; this cleared the way for the main army. The next day, Frederick moved out of Lützen at 3:00 pm, during heavy rain.
