500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M. Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures [...] "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" [...] is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than {{the way in which we}} absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come at the problem from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones.
