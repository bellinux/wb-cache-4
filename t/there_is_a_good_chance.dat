5|$|As of 2013, Schafer {{is still}} {{interested}} in a sequel to Brütal Legend, but would require appropriate funding and resources {{to make it happen}} as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for Psychonauts 2 in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that a sequel to Brütal Legend would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E
5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees {{to let him go}} because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E

If a diagnosis of STEC-HUS is confirmed, plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is contraindicated. However, plasmapheresis may be indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty between HUS and TTP.|$|E

2500|$|Examples {{of other}} changes are [...] "truly I tell you" [...] becomes [...] "I {{tell you the}} truth;" [...] "fellow workers" [...] becomes [...] "coworkers;" [...] "the Jews," [...] {{particularly}} in John's Gospel, often becomes [...] "Jewish leaders" [...] when the context makes the statement's real meaning apparent; and [...] "miracles," [...] especially in John, become the more literal [...] "signs," [...] "miraculous signs," [...] or [...] "works." [...] The word for [...] "Spirit," [...] where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> it means the Holy Spirit, is now capitalized.

2500|$|Significantly, {{the search}} {{revealed}} {{no trace of}} {{either of the two}} Vest Pocket Kodak (VPK) cameras that the pair were known to be carrying from Irvine's diaries, leading to speculation {{that at least one of}} the cameras must have been in Irvine's possession. Experts from Kodak have stated that if one of the cameras is found, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> that the film could be developed to produce [...] "printable images", due to the nature of the black and white film that was used and the fact that it has, in effect, been in [...] "deep freeze" [...] for over three-quarters of a century. Such images would potentially illuminate the fate of Mallory and Irvine more clearly than any other evidence.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{development}} is the mask with two windows, one for each eye. It can have the windows closer to the face than the one-window type, and therefore contain even less internal volume for the diver to clear or equalise. These types are often called a [...] "low-volume mask". [...] Participants in the sport of underwater hockey are required to use twin-lens masks of this type for their own safety - the sport uses a heavy lead puck similar to an ice hockey puck, nan but skilful players can flick the puck considerable height off the bottom when making passes {{which leads to the}} possibility of accidental puck contact with other players. [...] Should a puck hit the lens of a single-lens mask <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> it will break the glass and pass through the aperture to hit the face and eyes, but with a twin-lens mask though the glass may break the frame will prevent the passage of the puck any further.|$|E
2500|$|More importantly, the {{involvement}} of Lauper, a celebrity completely unrelated to wrestling, in the pro wrestling world was unprecedented. MTV's decision to broadcast the Brawl to End it All tremendously increased the WWF's public profile, especially in the coveted young adult demographic. This led directly to the 1980s professional wrestling boom. Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer wrote, [...] "Without Albano, wrestling history would have been monumentally different because if you take Lauper's involvement out of the equation, the early losses on expanding nationally and buying so much television time {{were on the verge}} of putting the company under... Without her, there would have been no MTV special, no national media publicity, and it's highly unlikely without it that the first WrestleMania would have been a success. If you take Albano's participation out of the equation, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> the McMahon expansion would have hit an iceberg and died in early 1985... the attention garnered by the Rock & Wrestling Connection, stemming from that chance meeting on an airplane between Lauper and Albano less than two years earlier, led NBC to make the decision to air pro wrestling several times per year in the Saturday Night Live time slot." ...|$|E

Many circumstances combined to make my compliance with his request anything but easy or desirable; but knowing that you--or your brother I ought, perhaps, rather to say--were interested in the young woman, I determined to take the very earliest opportunity of seeing her, and consulting with her medical attendant. I could not get to her till late in the afternoon. When I arrived, I found her suffering from one of the worst attacks of Typhus I ever remember to have seen; and I think it my duty to state candidly, that I believe her life to be in imminent danger. At the same time, it is right to inform you that the gentleman in attendance on her does not share my opinion: he still thinks <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of saving her.|$|E
