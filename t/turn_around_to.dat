5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so deeply that they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of the wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

25|$|Hearing her screams {{from behind}} the door, Teresa (Jenna Dewan Tatum) is spotted by Bloody Face who kicks {{open the door and}} attacks her. Grabbing her, Bloody Face then throws Teresa against a wall, {{knocking}} her unconscious. Bloody Face prepares to kill Teresa when Leo (Adam Levine), in an attempt to save her life, throws himself into Bloody Face's way, knocking both of them onto the floor and Bloody Face unconscious. While Teresa regains consciousness, Leo kicks the murder weapon away from Bloody Face towards Teresa. Grabbing the weapon, Teresa violently stabs Bloody Face. They attempt to run down the hall to escape and another Bloody Face on the other end stops them. In disbelief, they <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> see a third Bloody Face, who fatally shoots them. The two Bloody Faces removed their masks and discuss the recent events, with one appearing nervous of their crime. One of them notices Leo's arm and questions it just as another Bloody Face approaches them.|$|E

500|$|Courses {{range from}} beaches with debris-littered water to swamps and ice-covered mountains. The game has its {{variant of the}} {{traditional}} race track, but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints {{at either end of}} the course, and the starting grid in the center. [...] Riders race to one end, then <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. [...] This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.|$|E
500|$|A road to {{the summit}} of Brockway Mountain was first {{proposed}} in the 1920s by Warren H. Manning, a renowned landscape architect. Manning was in the Keweenaw {{at the time to}} design Agassiz Park in Calumet and suggested the road while visiting the area. The road was designed in 1932 with three different options considered. The first involved the construction of the current road from near the Silver River on the west to the summit. It followed a route used by the previous Military Road that connected Fort Wilkins to Fort Howard; traffic would have to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> descend Brockway Mountain. Another option included a route from the summit southwest across the Upson Creek Valley to a second summit on the nearby Mount Lookout, a total of about [...] The third option was that of the current route down the mountain to the west.|$|E

500|$|The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August {{and headed}} east, towards Constantinople, trailed by Gloucester which was radioing the German {{movements}} to Milne. Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon ordered Breslau to turn about {{and pretend to}} lay mines {{in an effort to}} scare off Gloucester. Captain Howard Kelly decided to attack the German ship in an effort to force Goeben to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> support her consort as the British ship was more heavily armed than Breslau. Kelly opened fire at a range of [...] with his forward six-inch gun at 13:35 on the 7th and then increased speed when the German ship replied with her [...] guns. When he had closed the range to , he turned to unmask Gloucesters broadside. This caused Souchon to turn and open fire on the British cruiser and Kelly disengaged, having accomplished his goal. Gloucester fired 18 six- and 14 four-inch shells during the brief engagement, but only hit Breslau once to little effect. She was not hit in return. Kelly was forced to break off his pursuit at 16:40 as Milne had strictly forbidden him to pass Cape Matapan, Greece, and his coal was running low.|$|E

After the third hill, it enters a pretzel-shaped turnaround (a set of trim brakes can be found before the <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> reduce the speed and positive Gs) where it curves to the left toward the beach and then left again into another tunnel. The train then traverses over seven airtime hills and a third tunnel into a mid-course brake run. The train turns left and goes back over the walkway to Cedar Point Shores. It then turns right and enters the brake run, followed by a 90 degree right turn back into the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|This {{trail is}} about 0.5 {{miles long and}} a low {{challenge}} trail. The trail is well maintained, but the natural pool that it leads to is open during summer months only. Starting from the visitor's parking area, hikers get on PR-143 walking northeast bound (that is, making a left from the parking area to head [...] "East" [...] on PR-143) about 0.25 miles, then make a right into the forest at the sign ("Verada #6 - Piscina") to get on Trail #6.

Continuing south on the trail, there are two eye-catching waterfalls visible from the trail. Continuing southbound and uphill, the trail goes through two flat and open areas with picnic tables.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 June, the Danish force had the wind at their backs (the weather gauge) and could rake Sjöblad's force with their heavier guns while still keeping {{out of range of}} the lighter Swedish artillery. Since the wind was too light for coordinated maneuvers, Juel gave orders for every captain to attack the nearest enemy ship to sink or capture them. By 4 o'clock, Juel's {{flagship}} Christianus V had caught up with Sjöblad's Amarant and after an intense artillery duel that lasted two hours, the Swedish flagships lost a yard and had its largest topsail shot to pieces. Per Rosenlund of the Andromeda tried to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> assist his admiral, but his crew refused to follow orders since they [...] "did not {{want to go back and}} let themselves be slaughtered like sheep". Sjöblad had to surrender and was taken prisoner. Kalmar Kastell was attacked by four Danish ships and also struck its colors. The captain of the Swedish ship, Cornelis Thijssen, gave his artillery officer orders to shoot up the ship's hull, and the Danish boarding party had to quickly ground the ship at Falster, later only managing to salvage the guns and the rig.|$|E
2500|$|The {{abandoned}} subway station, {{which serves}} as the new lair for the Turtles, is based on real-world decommissioned New York subway City Hall Station, of the former Interborough Rapid Transit company. However, the station is not completely abandoned, as it appears in the movie. [...] Trains currently pass through the station daily as they <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> head uptown, passengers are allowed to ride through the station, but the train does not stop and so they cannot disembark. [...] During filming of the scene where the Turtles are trapped in the net and fall to the ground, one of the stuntmen broke an ankle. Some filming took place in North Carolina, much like the first, where the New York City skyline was created at the North Carolina Film Studios. The building used for the entrance to April's apartment is {{the office of the}} New York location of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, which did the animatronics work for the film as well as its predecessor. The film is dedicated to the memory of Jim Henson, who had died the previous May. This made it the first movie dedicated to Henson, the second being The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). This is also the first TMNT film to include a dedication; the second would be TMNT, which was dedicated to the late Mako, the voice actor for Splinter in that film.|$|E
