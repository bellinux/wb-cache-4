5000|$|From {{time immemorial}} the {{inhabitants}} of Isone regularly crossed the <b>Tiglio</b> alpine pass to arrive in the Camorino area, where they owned vineyards and arable land. Over the centuries, many of them finally created a village. Camorino is first mentioned in 1237 {{as part of the}} lands of the collegiate church of S. Pietro in Bellinzona. [...] A church is mentioned in the village in 1237 and 1285, but no visible traces have been preserved. The existing parish church of San Martino was built in 1553 and completely renovated in 1888. In 1583, the village church split from the Bellinzona parish and was confirmed in 1591 as a separate parish.|$|E
