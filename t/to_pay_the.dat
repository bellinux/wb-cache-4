5|$|The {{accounts}} differ as {{to exactly}} how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure {{was the result of}} disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.|$|E
