5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications.

5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens.

Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E

5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs.

50|$|After <b>the</b> war, <b>Brilliant</b> was {{purchased}} by the accomplished sailor Briggs Cunningham, who attempted to increase her speed by outfitting her with a larger rig. The new rig consisted of taller masts, a self-tacking forestaysail, and a Bermuda-mainsail, replacing the original gaff main. During this time, Cunningham also invented {{what became known as}} the cunningham, a tie-down for the tack (the lower, forward corner of the mainsail) that allows the sail to maintain a more efficient shape. This makes <b>Brilliant</b> <b>the</b> first boat to have the device, now standard on racing boats of all sizes.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. <b>The</b> <b>brilliant</b> gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to <b>the</b> <b>brilliant</b> Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is <b>the</b> <b>brilliant</b> scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds.

5|$|In October 1784, Wilberforce {{embarked}} upon {{a tour of}} Europe {{which would}} ultimately change his life and determine his future career.

They visited the French Riviera and enjoyed the usual pastimes of dinners, cards, and gambling. In February 1785, Wilberforce returned to the United Kingdom temporarily, to support Pitt's proposals for parliamentary reforms. He rejoined the party in Genoa, Italy, from where they continued their tour to Switzerland. Milner accompanied Wilberforce to England, and on the journey they read The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul by Philip Doddridge, a leading early 18th-century English nonconformist.|$|E
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for <b>the</b> <b>brilliant</b> victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{quantitative}} determination of proteins in biological fluids, using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G- 250, was evaluated. Compared with the biuret method, <b>the</b> Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> Blue G- 250 method needs a much shorter time for analysis {{and has a}} greater sensitivity. The sensitivity of the dye for albumin is significantly greater than for globulins. The standard curves for the biuret method are more linear than those for <b>the</b> Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> Blue G- 250 method. <b>The</b> Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> Blue G- 250 method produces a precipitate, which sticks to {{the walls of the}} cuvet and results in an intolerable carry-over. Therefore, the use of <b>the</b> Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> Blue G- 250 method for the {{quantitative determination}} of proteins in urine and serum is not recommended.

5|$|The {{saprobic}} fungus {{grows on}} decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under leaf litter {{or in the}} soil. The cup-shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. <b>The</b> <b>brilliant</b> red interior of the cups—from which both the common and scientific names are derived—contrasts with the lighter-colored exterior. The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table. The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Indians, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. <b>The</b> <b>brilliant</b> yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and {{structural}} coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|In Milan, Sforza's enemies worked {{continually}} against him. The Piccinino brothers, sons {{of famous}} condottiere Niccolò Piccinino and former Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza. Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment {{at the end}} of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of Brescia, the city promised to him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed. Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiaradadda, Crema, and his service. The treaty was signed on 18 October 1448, and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year. With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, it was the beginning of the end of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last. The Piccinino brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as <b>the</b> <b>brilliant</b> Sforza.|$|E
