5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} {{coat that}} is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> {{so well that}} they have a minimal outer layer of fat on <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> pelicans float with relatively little of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes.

5|$|When some species, {{including}} Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, are disturbed, {{they produce}} secretions (ink) that luminesce at {{much the same}} wavelengths as <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Juveniles will luminesce more brightly {{in relation to their}} body size than adults, whose luminescence is diffused over <b>their</b> <b>bodies.</b> Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.|$|E
