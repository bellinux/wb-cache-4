[...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film as [...] "... a guileless exploration of the growing pains of sheltered innocents whose reticence and sincerity evoke 1950s small-town values" [...] and added, [...] "The performances all capture the perplexity of sexually repressed {{people who are trying to}} do the proper Christian thing while coping with unruly desires that they recognize as challenges to their way of life.

Many of the kids had siblings who were in gangs or had been affected by gangs. It was a loaded topic. I couldn't get the story out of my head.” He added “My telling some kids to stay out of gangs means nothing to them.

Readers can draw their own conclusions by seeing what happened to Yummy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> answers to be found, but hopefully the book will spark a lot of needed discussion.” ...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{positive}} reviews came from Roger Ebert, who awarded the film four stars out of four, writing: [...] "For all of its visual pyrotechnics, it's also a story where we care about the characters; there's {{a lot at stake}} at the end, and we're involved. I know people who hate it, finding it pretentious or unrestrained; I think it's one of the best films of the year." [...] Ebert later placed the film on his list of [...] "The Best 10 Movies of 2000", writing: [...] "Tarsem, the director, is a visual virtuoso who juggles his storylines effortlessly; it's dazzling, the way he blends so many notes, styles and genres into a film so original." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: [...] "The Cell becomes the first serial killer feature in a long time to take the genre in a new direction. Not only does it defy formulaic expectations, but it challenges the viewer to think and consider the horrors that can turn an ordinary child into an inhuman monster. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> answers, and The Cell doesn't pretend to offer any. Instead, Singh presents audiences with the opportunity to go on a harrowing journey. For those who are up to the challenge, it's worth spending time in The Cell." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Tarsem uses the dramatically shallow plot to create a dream world densely packed with images of beauty and terror that cling to the memory even if you don't want them to." ...|$|E
