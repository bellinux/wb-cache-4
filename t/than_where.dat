5|$|A non-competitive {{inhibitor}} binds {{to a site}} other <b>than</b> <b>where</b> {{the substrate}} binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence Km remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that Vmax is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.|$|E
5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable <b>than</b> <b>where</b> they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the {{cylinder}} slightly pressurized {{at all times}} during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of {{the cylinder}} with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper <b>than</b> <b>where</b> the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.|$|E

5|$|Louder Now was {{expected}} to sell 185,000 copies. It sold 158,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album had lower first-week sales <b>than</b> <b>Where</b> You Want to Be, which had sold 164,000 copies. Louder Now was surpassed {{at the top of}} the chart by Godsmack's IV, which sold 211,000 copies. The album was number two on the Digital Albums chart, number seven on the Top Rock Albums chart and number nine on the Tastemaker Albums chart. It was number five in Canada, number 17 in Australia, number 18 in the UK, number 70 in Ireland and number 90 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} <b>than</b> <b>where</b> they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams {{took advantage of}} uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|While in the vicinity, Hudah brought {{moderate}} winds to Rodrigues, St. Brandon, and Tromelin Island. The cyclone {{affected the}} same parts of Madagascar {{that were previously}} impacted by cyclones Eline and Gloria. Waves reached at least 8m (26ft) in height along the coast. The storm was considered the worst to affect the Antalaha region in 20years, where 90% of homes were destroyed. It was estimated that the storm left at least 100,000people homeless in Madagascar, and there were 111deaths. In Mozambique, damage was much less than expected, and the storm affected areas farther north in the country <b>than</b> <b>where</b> Eline struck. Heavy rainfall occurred along the coast, but was insufficient to cause river flooding. Strong winds damaged roofs and downed trees, mostly around Pebane, and the storm killed three people.|$|E

25|$|To block a shot, {{a player}} {{has to be}} able to reach a point higher <b>than</b> <b>where</b> the shot is released. Thus, height can be an {{advantage}} in blocking. Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.|$|E
25|$|Expenditures {{are often}} not well targeted. According to a World Bank study, {{there is a large}} gap in {{expenditures}} between rural and urban areas, in particular capital cities. Public expenditures go to where they are most easily spent rather <b>than</b> <b>where</b> they are most urgently needed. Sanitation receives {{only a small part of}} public expenditures: Low household demand for sanitation results in politicians not seeing sanitation as a vote winner, and therefore allocating scarce resources to sectors with higher perceived political rewards.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, with {{economic}} {{recovery from the}} Second World War, production of diesel locomotives had begun in many countries and the diesel locomotive {{was on its way}} to becoming the dominant type of locomotive. It offered greater flexibility and performance than the steam locomotive, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs, other <b>than</b> <b>where</b> electric traction was in use due to policy decisions. Currently, almost all diesel locomotives are diesel–electric, although the diesel–hydraulic type was widely used between the 1950s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are reproducible. A variety of things can {{influence}} the reliability of scores, so the concept of reliability applies to scores from tests given to groups of people (such as English-reading youths and their caregivers or teachers) in particular settings (such as a special education classroom or a community mental health clinic). Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} <b>than</b> <b>where</b> it had been studied before.|$|E
25|$|Crustaceans may {{pass through}} a number of larval and {{immature}} stages between hatching from their eggs and reaching their adult form. Each of the stages is separated by a moult, in which the hard exoskeleton is shed to allow the animal to grow. The larvae of crustaceans often bear little resemblance to the adult, and there are still cases where it is not known what larvae will grow into what adults. This is especially true of crustaceans which live as benthic adults (on the sea bed), more so <b>than</b> <b>where</b> the larvae are planktonic and therefore more easily caught.|$|E

25|$|No {{definite}} relation {{exists between}} the annual rings of growth {{and the amount of}} sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional {{to the size of the}} crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required <b>than</b> <b>where</b> they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.|$|E
25|$|The {{speaking}} dialect or accent of {{a person}} may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that {{is used in the}} style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent {{of a person}} <b>than</b> <b>where</b> they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Jewish thought has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} all meat must come from animals which have been slaughtered according to Jewish law.

Orthodox Jews argue that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, arguing that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called {{for it to be}} banned.|$|E
