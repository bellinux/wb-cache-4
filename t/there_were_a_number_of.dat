5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> uprisings {{against the}} Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained {{with the aid}} of local tribes. To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|The major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 concentrated on the building and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it. The results indicated that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> phases of occupation.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> families: Rhizodontida, Canowindridae, Elpistostegidae, Megalichthyidae, Osteolepidae and Tristichopteridae.

5|$|These {{fears were}} to prove {{justified}} as, during the line's {{first month of}} operation, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> well-publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in passengers standing for the whole journey to timekeeping difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations. Furthermore, signalling problems led to disruption on the line nearly a month after opening.|$|E

5|$|These {{victories}} ensured Argentine {{authority in}} the northwest and stopped the royalist advance into the central territory. Although <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colonialist 'invasions' from Upper Peru until 1821, Belgrano's campaign is widely considered the decisive one.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adoption}} of Christianity in territory, which is today Poland, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different a pagan tribes.

Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

5|$|Followers of Hinduism {{were also}} present {{to some extent}} during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> them in Rajarata during Elara's reign. Mahasen {{destroyed}} several Hindu temples during his reign in the 2nd century. Particularly Indian merchant communities living near ports such as Mahatittha and Gokanna were followers of Hinduism and Hindu temples were constructed in these areas. By {{the end of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom, large Hindu temples such as the Konesvaram temple had been constructed. Historical sources indicate that there were also Jains in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.|$|E
5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners {{who worked in the}} difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E

Mako Sakurai took over Karen's role from Yuuka Nanri, and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.|$|E

5|$|Pigs {{were the}} primary meat eaten by early Welsh folk, which could be {{preserved}} easily by salting. By 1700, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different Welsh breeds of pig, with long snouts and thin backs, generally light coloured, but some were dark or spotted. Today, pigs in Wales are either farmed intensively, using the white Welsh pig or Landrace pig, or extensively, where Saddleback pig, Welsh pig or crossbreeds are farmed.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal is a canal in the {{south-west}} of England between Bridgwater and Taunton, {{opened in}} 1827 and linking the River Tone to the River Parrett. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> abortive schemes {{to link the}} Bristol Channel to the English Channel by waterway in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These schemes followed the approximate route eventually taken by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, but the canal was instead built {{as part of a}} plan to link Bristol to Taunton by waterway.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class were}} the only battleships with the speed {{required}} for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task forces. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> proposals in the early Cold War to convert the class {{to take into account}} changes in technology and doctrine. These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and—in the case of Illinois and Kentucky—a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.|$|E

Throughout {{the last months}} of the year, additional attacks, mainly assassinations, occurred around Fallujah and Abu Ghraib. In October, twin bombings killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi. In December, a coordinated double suicide bombing outside Ramadi's government compound killed 25 people and severely wounded Governor Qasim Al-Fahdawi, who lost an arm.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> prison camps where Croatian POWs {{and civilians}} were detained, {{including}} the Sremska Mitrovica camp, the Stajićevo camp, and the Begejci camp in Serbia, and the Morinj camp in Montenegro. The Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps was later founded {{in order to}} help the victims of prison abuse. The Croatian Army established detention camps, like Lora prison camp in Split.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
