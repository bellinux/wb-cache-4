25|$|This process {{continues}} {{until the}} whole skein is wound. The time to skein yarn on a niddy-noddy {{depends on the}} yardage, and thus how many wraps need to be made. A larger niddy-noddy can speed up the skeining, but a very large one can be bulky, and thus slow down <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one wrap. At this point, the skein is secured by loose figure eight knots between each crossbar. This {{can be done with}} scrap yarn, or with slip knots {{from the end of the}} skein. In either case, loosely securing each end with a slip knot makes it easier to find the ends in the finished skein. Generally 4 or more knots are tied.|$|E

25|$|Though the alcohol-fueled Spring Weekend was {{cancelled}} by then-President Herman James (a non-alcoholic version {{continued for}} several years), Glassboro State College remained {{known for its}} hard partying culture. However, in 1988, there began {{one of the biggest}} crackdowns in school history. As result of the drinking death of freshman James Callahan at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, Herman James decided to make GSC an example {{for the rest of the}} State colleges and universities to follow. He invited the NJ Alcoholic Beverage Control commission (ABC) to the school and began shutting down off-campus parties, and placing undercover agents in the local liquor establishments. This prompted Morton Downey, Jr., who was based in Secaucus, New Jersey, and very popular at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an untelevised show focusing on the drinking age and the classic argument that an eighteen-year-old can go off to war and die for their country, but they cannot legally buy and consume a beer. The following year, the ABC did not return, and the partying atmosphere that Glassboro State College was known for, returned in earnest and continued into the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Most breeds of cat have a noted {{fondness for}} {{settling}} in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place {{may serve as}} a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a leopard. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This is known as the cat righting reflex. An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is around [...] Cats without a tail (e.g. Manx cats) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.|$|E
500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as [...] "purple haze all in my brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so would have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while {{under the influence of}} psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse me while I kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse me while I kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse me while I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E

500|$|Franz Liszt, a Hungarian composer, had {{attempted}} to write a Revolutionary Symphony as early as 1830; however, his focus for {{the early part of}} his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist. [...] "Lisztomania" [...] swept across Europe, the emotional charge of his recitals making them [...] "more like séances than serious musical events", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical. Musicologist Alan Walker says, [...] "Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him.... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy." [...] The demands of concert life [...] "reached exponential proportions" [...] and [...] "every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others." [...] Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform. He settled in Weimar, where he had been made its honorary music director in 1842, to work on his compositions.|$|E
500|$|Also {{returning}} to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vastra, Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart as Jenny.

Instead, he decided to bring them back in the main series. Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions, as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005. Smith commented that Grant was [...] "born to be a Who villain. He pitches it on that perfect level and tone". Grant's appearance in Doctor Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter, announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012. Tom Ward was drawn to his role because {{of the quality of the}} script, and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme.

After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed.

[...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
