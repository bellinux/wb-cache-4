Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs in the top of <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning.

5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out in the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E

5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming {{into the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.|$|E

He lost a no-hitter in <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> in one of those games.

He helped Jimenez get his first win at Camden Yards of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had never met the Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles which has never happened to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment on July 6, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The 1998 National League wild-card tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1998 regular season, played between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants {{to determine the}} winner of the National League (NL) wild card. The game took place at Wrigley Field in Chicago, on September 28, 1998. The Cubs won the game 5–3, holding the Giants scoreless {{for the majority of the}} game until the Giants threatened heavily in <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> and scored all three of their runs. As a result of the game, the Cubs qualified for the postseason and the Giants did not.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> so the game went into extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
