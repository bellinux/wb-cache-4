As a married woman Murasaki would have had {{servants}} to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (monogatari) such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and The Tales of Ise. Scholars believe she may have started writing The Tale of Genji before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps {{in a state of}} grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time... The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> continuing loneliness was quite unbearable".|$|E
2500|$|In 1907 Albert Einstein, in {{what was}} {{described}} by him as [...] "the happiest <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life", realized that an observer who is falling {{from the roof of}} a house experiences no gravitational field. [...] In other words, gravitation was exactly equivalent to acceleration. [...] Between 1911 and 1915 this idea, initially stated as the Equivalence principle, was formally developed into Einstein's theory of general relativity.|$|E
2500|$|Romero {{revolutionized}} the horror film genre with Night of the Living Dead; according to Almar Haflidason of the BBC, the film represented [...] "a new dawn in horror film-making". The film has also effectively redefined {{the use of}} the term [...] "zombie". While the word [...] "zombie" [...] itself is never used—the word used in the film is ghoul—Romero's film introduced the theme of zombies as reanimated, flesh-eating cannibals. Romero himself didn't initially consider the antagonists in the film zombies, later saying [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> guys as zombies, when I made the first film...To me, zombies were still those boys in the Caribbean doing the wetwork for [...] Lugosi." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 998 Murasaki married Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 – c. 1001); {{she gave}} birth to a {{daughter}} in 999. Two years later her husband died. Scholars are unsure when she started writing the novel (monogatari) The Tale of Genji but she was certainly writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: [...] "I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion... doing little more than registering the passage of time.... The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> continuing loneliness was quite unbearable". On the strength of her reputation as an author, Murasaki entered service with Shōshi at court, almost certainly at the request of Shōshi's father, Fujiwara no Michinaga, perhaps as an incentive to continue adding chapters to The Tale of Genji. She began writing her diary after entering imperial service.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
