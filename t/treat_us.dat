25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her letter}} and social media statement, the {{controversy}} about her feminism heightened. Piers Morgan stated that Ratajkowski's form of feminism was a misguided affront to true feminism, labeling it pseudo-feminist gibberish. After Morgan wrote that [...] "feminism {{as it was}} intended is dead", the Chicago Tribune Heidi Stevens, as well as The Daily Telegraph Helen Pankhurst (Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter) said that Ratajkowski neither killed nor bolstered feminism. Women's Wear Daily Taylor Harris questioned the impact of Ratajkowski's feminism. The Independent Gill questioned Ratajkowski's feminism, saying that her professional activities [...] "continued to advocate industries that <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> as pieces of meat". Heather Saul of The Independent wrote in support of Ratajkowski in an article subtitled [...] "Ratajkowski is becoming an important feminist voice {{in the debate over}} female censorship and sexuality". New York Allie Jones called Ratajkowski [...] "the best feminist celeb".|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. <b>Treat</b> <b>us</b> accordingly.'" [...] In an interview for Rolling Stone, Ice-T stated that [...] "We just celebrated the fourth of July, which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the Revolutionary War, there were songs similar to mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{decades later}} Kramer {{continued}} {{to advocate for}} social and legal equity for homosexuals. [...] "Our own country's democratic process declares us to be unequal, which means, in a democracy, that our enemy is you," [...] he wrote in 2007. [...] "You <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> like crumbs. You hate us. And sadly, we let you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{family had}} {{encountered}} {{an incident in}} the past; the family had to delist and change their phone number in Lower Manhattan because fans worldwide were calling their apartment relentlessly. Draper recalls, [...] "Little girls would call and say, 'Helloooo, is [...] there? We just love him.' The only thing that's comforting is, they're pretty harmless at that age." [...] According to Nat, [...] "After the show came on, people began to really <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> like huge rock stars. They'd scream on the street, and we'd look behind us {{to see what they}} were screaming about, because we didn't realize it was us." ...|$|E
2500|$|French composers {{including}} Hector Berlioz {{struggled in}} vain against {{the tide of}} Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera [...] Benvenuto Cellini [...] staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime. [...] Berlioz complained in the Journal des Debats that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. [...] "Monsieur Donizetti has the air to <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> like a conquered country," [...] he wrote, [...] "it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer call them the lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti." ...|$|E

2500|$|Political {{scientist}} Charles T. Rubin {{believes that}} AI can be neither designed nor {{guaranteed to be}} benevolent. He argues that [...] "any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence." [...] Humans should not assume machines or robots would <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> favorably, {{because there is no}} a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.|$|E
2500|$|By Sunday evening, {{the gang}} {{gathered}} their captives at the hotel, {{a total of}} 62 by Reardon's count. The gang insisted that drinks be provided to the townspeople and that music be played. They danced with hostages while the landlady's son sang bushranger ballads, including [...] "The Wild Colonial Boy", {{as well as a}} more recent song about the gang's exploits. Dan and Joe Byrne became fairly drunk; Ned, however, abstained from drinking. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, he staged games with the hostages, including hop, step and jump, for which he used a revolver in each hand as balancing weights. The hostages were also encouraged to amuse themselves with card games. One hostage later testified, [...] " [...] did not <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> badly—not at all." ...|$|E

'Tis this makes us take the Liberty of most humbly intreating your Majesty, that you will yourself please to name that Person of your Ministers, whom you shall judge most proper to fulfil (sic) your Intentions to us. Your Majesty's Choice is much more certain than ours, because it is guided and enlightened by your paternal Goodness…" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of {{theories}} of abiogenesis {{to explain the}} origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe, Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia, and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds [...] was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: [...] "In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism, our position is unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective—and our suggestion for {{a way out of the}} crisis has not yet been considered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grand Duke George {{wrote to}} his wife in England, “We were each given a cell, and later on were joined by Dmitry. I saw him {{arriving}} through the iron bars of my window, and was struck by his sad expression. The first twenty-four hours were hard, but after that, they luckily allowed us to have our camp beds and also our clothes. There is {{no one in the}} prison but we three”. He informed that they were guarded, by soldiers from the Baltic provinces. [...] “They <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> like comrades, and have not locked our cells after the second day, while they allow us to walk in the small garden in the courtyard. Our food is brought from outside. ” [...] While imprisoned, rumors of the tsar's assassination reached them; this seemed to indicate the worst and Grand Duke George was, of the three Grand Dukes, the more pessimistic. On 21 July, all of the exiled Grand Dukes in Vologda were again transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{seemed to}} have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson {{replaced}} Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness. The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserves, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. The United States would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained that [...] "Both sides [...] <b>treat</b> <b>us</b> with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded in our faces and deservedly.". The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a [...] "big navy" [...] plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) saw the main German High Seas Fleet engage in a monumental yet inconclusive clash with the far stronger Grand Fleet of the Royal Navy. Arguing this battle proved the validity of Mahanian doctrine, the navalists took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armour-plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the US Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, Germany thought, with Germany victorious. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led to war in 1917.|$|E
