5|$|Kosher salt, though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing kosher meat. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> for all products labelled as kosher salt.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the over}} 3400 species of frog and toad worldwide, the {{majority}} {{live in the}} tropics. However, Michigan's species live where it is often cold, necessitating adaptions to freezing weather due to their ectothermic (cold-blooded) nature. Most frogs and toads become dormant in the winter; some frogs can withstand short periods of freezing conditions, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> of all species. Some species of salamander also hibernate during the winter, while other fully aquatic species remain active throughout the year. Amphibians are vulnerable to many types of human encroachment, including water pollution, automobiles, the destruction of wetlands through farming {{and the use of}} off-road vehicles and chemical pesticides. In Michigan, wetlands protection legislation is in place to prevent pollution and destruction, while additional wetlands are being reclaimed and restored after agricultural usage has ceased.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E

50|$|He is very {{protective}} of Euda {{as well as}} her other brother. Ishmael and Zacarias thought that Johanne has found a weak point in Euda and has forced her to marry him but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R
50|$|In early 2006, it {{was rumored}} that the station had changed its call sign to WBZB. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> and WBON, a station on Long Island, New York, used the WBZB calls for nine months in 2007.|$|R

25|$|The first {{principle}} assumes equal probabilities for all events. When <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true,</b> we {{must first}} determine the probabilities of each event. Then, the probability {{is the sum of}} the probabilities of all possible favoured events.|$|E
50|$|Although initial {{news reports}} {{said there was}} a warrant for Few's arrest prior to or after the shooting, the state police have said <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> In addition, Edmonson said that there was no {{evidence}} of a firearm inside Few's vehicle.|$|R

25|$|Coon's {{modified}} {{form of the}} Weidenreich Theory {{is sometimes}} referred to as the Candelabra Hypothesis. A misunderstanding however has led some to believe that Coon supported parallel evolution or polygenism; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> since Coon's evolution model still allows for gene-flow, although he did not stress it.|$|E
25|$|In early, archaic {{portraits of}} Athena in black-figure pottery, the goddess retains {{some of her}} Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings, {{although}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> of archaic sculpture {{such as those of}} Aphaean Athena, where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous—Aphaea—goddess with Cretan connections in her mythos.|$|E

25|$|Ray-finned fishes, class Actinopterygii, {{differ from}} lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin {{supported}} by spines ("rays") made of bone or horn. There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures. Ray-finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone, though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> of sturgeons and paddlefishes.|$|E
25|$|For every {{natural number}} , the -sphere is compact. Again from the Heine–Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional normed vector space is compact. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> for {{infinite}} dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if {{and only if}} its closed unit ball is compact.|$|E
25|$|If {{the base}} b equals e, then the {{derivative}} is simply 1/x, and at x=1 this derivative equals 1.

25|$|Most {{metalworking}} and {{machining processes}} {{can benefit from}} the use of cutting fluid, depending on workpiece material. Common exceptions to this are cast iron and brass, which may be machined dry (though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>true</b> of all brasses, and any machining of brass will likely benefit from the presence of a cutting fluid).|$|E
25|$|Protective {{measures}} such as respirators have brought a steady decline in death rates due to silicosis in Western countries.

25|$|Boaters {{approaching}} a lock are usually {{pleased to meet}} another boat coming towards them, because this boat will have just exited the lock on their level and therefore set the lock in their favour – saving about 5 to 10 minutes.
