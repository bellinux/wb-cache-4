5|$|The {{popularity}} of the film has also spread overseas. The film was an inspiration for Japanese companies Studio Hibari and Aniplex, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the manga and anime franchise Nerima Daikon Brothers, which contain heavy references to the film.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E
5|$|Apple’s first tablet {{computer}} was the Newton MessagePad 100, introduced in 1993, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the ARM6 processor core with Acorn Computers. Apple {{also developed a}} prototype PowerBook Duo-based tablet, the PenLite, but decided not to sell {{it in order to}} avoid hurting MessagePad sales. Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp and the Bishop of Worcester had {{a dispute}} over the lands that Beauchamp {{inherited}} from d'Abetot.

5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, the {{laboratory}} {{had come up}} with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse.

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 {{and continues to be}} offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> an island arc of volcanoes {{on the west coast}} of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with {{the early stages of the}} creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was not {{satisfied}} with Ironside's progress, especially with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced {{that they were in}} close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E
