5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates where <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{possible}} endings. The Sole Survivor {{is faced with}} a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, or to inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and trigger a feud between the Harbormen and Acadia. Should the player choose to detonate the warhead, the Harbormen will {{take control of the}} island, while if the player destroys the fog condensers, <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>will</b> become dominant. In both scenarios Acadia will be spared, though DiMA will be disapprove of the player's actions. Alternatively, if the player confronts DiMA over Avery's murder, Acadia may become hostile. The Sole Survivor is able to establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt a more moderate stance towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can choose to make the main factions aware of Acadia's existence. If so, The Institute, a scientific organization that made the synths, will send agents to reclaim the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a quasi-religious organization rooted in the United States Armed Forces, will launch an expedition to exterminate them. The Railroad, a group opposed to the existence of The Institute with the aim of freeing sentient synths, will send an operative to make contact with Acadia, though the latter will reject their help.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law, but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any form of marriage to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.|$|E

500|$|According to Gayle Smith, {{a family}} lawyer, {{there are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to a joint physical custody arrangement. One benefit of joint physical custody is that the burden of sole custody is not placed on the parent as the time involved in raising the children is divided among the two parties involved, allowing each of the parties more time to spend on their careers, for instance. A second benefit of joint physical custody is that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> still have a [...] "significant period" [...] of time {{with each of the}} parents, which closely resembles the relationship before the divorce, legal separation, or break-up. A third benefit of joint physical custody is that it helps ensure that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> grow up with both a male and a female role model, which may not be ensured through sole physical custody, for instance.|$|E
500|$|The live Hi-5 stage {{shows are}} {{designed}} to be presented as stage spectaculars, as the audiences of children attending the shows are usually experiencing their first theatre event.

Group members have expressed that even in countries in which English is not the main spoken language, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> still enjoy themselves. However, the shows for these audiences are adapted to include [...] "more songs, comedy and physical activity". Greene stated the television show is designed to be a joined experience that parents should be able to enjoy along with their children, with the stage shows made to appeal to a whole family audience. Nicholson described the experience of a parent being able to dance with their child at a concert as [...] "special".|$|E

2500|$|The Mchinji Mission Orphanage, {{popularly known}} as the [...] "Home of Hope", {{is one of the}} largest children's homes in Malawi. Reverend Thomson Chipeta, remembering losing both his parents, brought {{orphaned}} children into his home in 1992 and construction of an orphanage began in 1998. As of 2007, there are six large residential houses, a dining/assembly hall, a clinic, classrooms for nursery, primary and secondary classes, and staff housing. [...] "Baby David" [...] lived in the orphanage prior to being adopted by Madonna. The children are divided into different houses and each house has its own 'amayi'. An amayi acts as the house mother for the children. Each morning all the children must attend a daily devotion, in which there will be lots of singing and prayers. Following the devotion ceremony <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> all line up outside the 'kitchen' where they will get nsima for their breakfast. Nsima, maize and beans is typically what they will eat for every meal. Not all children living at the orphanage are 'orphans', many still have family however they are unable to provide basic necessities so they send them to Home of Hope.

2500|$|PKU is an {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic genetic disorder. As an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder, two PKU alleles {{are required for}} an individual to exhibit symptoms of the disease.

5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|R
5000|$|Baller-Gerold {{syndrome}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning that an affected child gets one mutant allele from each parent {{to produce the}} syndrome. [...] A carrier is someone who has one mutant allele but does not does have any symptoms. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have BGS. There is also a 50% chance <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have one mutant copy (be a carrier) and be asymptomatic and a 25% chance <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be asymptomatic and not a carrier. In order for someone to have BGS, {{they need to have}} two mutant copies of the gene. Adults may pursue genetic counselling to understand the syndrome, as well as the risks and choices regarding family planning.|$|R
2500|$|An aunt is {{travelling}} {{by train}} {{with her two}} nieces and a nephew. The children are inquisitive and mischievous. A bachelor is also travelling in the same compartment.

2500|$|Cattle have {{historically}} been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value among the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson notes that [...] "...among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle were continually underplayed." [...] Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. It is this exchange of cattle which ensures that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be considered {{to belong to the}} husband's lineage and to his line of descent. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can [...] "father" [...] children after his death, is based on this ability of cattle exchanges to define relations of kinship and descent. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry, and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. [...] A barren woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children (obviously biologically fathered by men from outside unions) then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to participate in reproduction in a metaphorical sense.|$|E
2500|$|Jackman reprised {{his role}} as Wolverine in another solo-film titled Logan in 2017, but has {{confirmed}} {{that this will be}} his final appearance as the character. The film is set in 2029; by this point Logan's healing factor has deteriorated, causing him to age rapidly. He is also slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. He spends his days working as a chauffeur and hustling for prescription drugs along the border between Texas and Mexico. He and fellow mutant Caliban live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, where they care for a senile Charles Xavier, who had inadvertently killed several of his X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier. He is tasked by Gabriela, a nurse for Transigen, to escort an 11-year-old girl, Laura, to a place in North Dakota called [...] "Eden." [...] Logan, Charles, and Laura escape the Transigen hunters called the [...] "Reavers," [...] and discover that Laura is Logan's [...] "daughter", as she was bred with his DNA. After accepting shelter from a family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by X-24, a perfect clone of Logan. Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, which is a safe haven run by Rictor and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian border and entrusts Laura to them before departing on his own. However, when the children are located and captured by the Reavers, Logan uses a mutant serum given to him by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He then plows through the Reavers, but the serum quickly wears off before he meets Zander Rice, the head of the Transigen project, who sought to avenge his father's death during the Weapon X program by creating the virus. Logan kills Rice and confronts X-24. However, with his healing factor now gone, Logan is no match for X-24, who impales him through a tree. Laura shoots X-24 in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years, destroying his brain and half his skull. After Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, Laura and the children bury him before continuing their journey across the border. As they all leave, Laura returns to Logan's grave, removes the cross, and places it on its side to create an [...] "X" [...] to honor Logan as the last of the X-Men.|$|E
