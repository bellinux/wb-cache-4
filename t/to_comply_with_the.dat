5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. <b>To</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers who choose to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor {{to submit to the}} recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

50|$|Social psychologists view {{compliance}} as a {{means of}} social influence used to reach goals and attain social or personal gains.

Their gaining of or submission to compliance is frequently influenced by construals—i.e. an individual's interpretation of their social environment and interactions.|$|R
