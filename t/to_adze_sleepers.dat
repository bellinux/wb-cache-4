40|$|We report our {{attempts}} to experimentally replicate 25 fine-grained basalt Hawaiian quadrangular adzes using freehand percussion. We document the techniques, stages and distinctive debitage resulting from {{each stage of}} the reduction process. While the later experimental adzes in our series reproduced the Hawaiian quadrangular adze with accuracy, {{we were unable to}} achieve the level of finesse seen in some finished archaeological specimens. Our experiments, and the gap between our own results and the finest examples seen in some archaeological collections, indicates the very high levels of skill needed to make the most refined Hawaiian adzes, and supports the notion that some adze makers were undoubtedly specialists. Our experimental work complements another study of archaeological adzes that examines the technological strategies and the cumulative addition of morphological elements <b>to</b> <b>adzes</b> during manufacture. We hope this study will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing quadrangular adze technology across Hawai‘i and throughout Polynesia, leading {{to a better understanding of}} regional and temporal variation in adze technology...|$|R
50|$|Manufactured {{from the}} hinge {{line of a}} giant clam (Tridacna gigas), the shell adze was found {{associated}} with a Neolithic burial assemblage in Duyong Cave, Quezon, Palawan. This shell tool is similar <b>to</b> the shell <b>adzes</b> recovered in Okinawa, Japan. Shells were used as tools in the Pacific {{as a replacement for}} hard stones which were not available on the islands. The presence of shell adzes not only in Palawan but also in Tawi-Tawi is very significant in the study of movements of people from the insular Southeast Asia to the Pacific. This shell tool is similar <b>to</b> the shell <b>adzes</b> recovered in Micronesia and Ryukyu Islands in Okinawa, Japan.|$|R

40|$|Hawaiian adze {{manufacture}} {{requires a}} great deal of skill and undoubtedly required long apprenticeships to achieve the finesse seen in many finished prehistoric adzes. Despite the presence of more than two dozen adze quarries in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i, and previous attempts at replicating adze preforms and positing reduction sequences in Polynesia, there is no detailed study that clearly defines the steps and stages of quadrangular adze preform manufacture (the most common form in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i), and the resulting characteristic debitage. In this paper we examine the sequence of adze production for a population of 109 adzes from Moloka 2 ̆ 7 i, documenting the transition from blanks to preforms to the finished objects that were transported away from quarries. Reduction intensity is measured using the Scar Density Index (Clarkson, 2013) calculated from 3 D scans. We document the sequence of cumulative additions of characteristic features <b>to</b> <b>adzes</b> (e. g. bidirectional edges, bevel, poll and tang) as reduction intensity increases. We also note the reasons for adze rejection at each stage of reduction. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of adze reduction in Polynesia facilitated and standardised by 3 D scanning technology. Hopefully, it will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing adze technology in other parts of Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i and across Polynesia, leading {{to a better understanding of}} regional and temporal variation in adze technology...|$|R
5000|$|The name Te Waipounamu for the South Island {{originates}} from Ngāi Tahu, {{the principal}} Māori iwi (tribe) {{of the southern}} region of New Zealand, who utilised the very hard greenstone (jade) <b>to</b> make <b>adzes</b> and other implements, as well as ornaments. Particularly valued was a paler nephrite which the Māori called inanga, gathered in a remote area near {{what is now called}} the Dart Valley. Māori named the district wāhi pounamu, meaning [...] "place of greenstone", and the South Island came to be called Te Wāhi Pounamu. This somehow evolved into Te Wai Pounamu which means [...] "the water(s) of greenstone" [...] but bears no relation to the original meaning.|$|R
25|$|As iron-age {{technology}} moved {{south into}} Africa with migrating ancient Egyptians, they carried their technology with them, including <b>adzes.</b> <b>To</b> this day, iron adzes are used all over rural Africa for various purposes - from digging pit latrines, and chopping firewood, to tilling crop fields - {{whether they are}} of maize (corn), coffee, tea, pyrethrum, beans, millett, yams or a plethora of other cash and subsistence crops.|$|R
50|$|When width exceeds {{thickness}} {{they were}} named flat adzes (Flachhacke), when thickness exceeds width shoe-last adzes (Schuhleistenkeile), or high adzes. Within {{the latter group}} a distinction is sometimes made between intermediate Flomborn adzes and the higher Hinkelstein adzes (Buttler 1938; Bakels 1987; Merkel 1999). Later, subdivisions were {{made on the basis}} of metric characteristics into two groups (Schietzel 1965), six groups (Modderman 1970, 184) and finally two groups again (Dohrn-Ihmig 1983). All typologies were based on the width-height ratio, while Modderman added the absolute dimension. The wide variation, from small to large and from flat <b>to</b> high <b>adzes,</b> certainly reflects a functional differentiation, but the various types do not appear to be of chronological significance.|$|R

He used his axe and <b>adze</b> <b>to</b> cut and shape the timber for bearers, joists, walls and {{household}} furniture. He used massive bed logs in the ground, drop slabs for the rear wall and capped his cottage with a shingled gable roof. Additions to the house resulted in two front rooms under another shingle gable roof.|$|R
40|$|Detailed study ofadze {{production}} sites at Pohakuloa by the University ofHawai 'i Archaeological Field School provided new insights on traditional Hawaiian economic organization. Most importantly, these sites reveal that Mauna Kea basalt was used <b>to</b> manufacture <b>adzes</b> {{outside of the}} main quarry. Moreover, there is strong evidence that adze production and use at Pohakuloa was embedded in a broader economy of resource extraction that included bird catching, volcanic glass reduction, and other activities. This pattern of expedient adze production was markedly different than the Mauna Kea system that focused on highly intensified craft specialization. Findings from Pohakuloa confirm that economic models of traditional Hawaiian society must also account for non-specialized modes of production.

50|$|Shape {{and wear}} {{show that they}} were used as <b>adzes</b> <b>to</b> fell trees and to work wood. Some blades have traces of hafting as well. The finds from the wells of Kückhoven and Eythra in Germany {{demonstrate}} a high standard of carpentry.

50|$|The resin, thus {{extracted}} from varieties of triodia {{was a key}} ingredient for binding the stone blades <b>to</b> native hafted <b>adzes,</b> which were of two types, tula and burren, the former, the type used by spinifex people, using the distal edge, the other the lateral edge, for working materials. The materials for the tula adze were obtained by knapping tula flakes to form 'slugs' or blades, the tool being then employed for woodwork, to hollow out yandis or fashion boomerangs and spears.|$|R

40|$|Stone adzes {{are found}} {{throughout}} the Pacific islands and documenting their diversity is critical to understanding relationships between past human populations. The adze typology devised by Roger Duff {{half a century ago}} is the standard across New Zealand and the rest of Polynesia. Here we describe the different types in the Duff system and analyse 148 adzes from the Wairau Bar site, which has a high diversity of complete adzes and is the assemblage that Duff used as the basis of his system. We use Principal Components Analysis of morphometric variables to test the empirical basis of the Duff system - an analytical exercise that should have applicability to typological systems elsewhere. Our results show different Duff types clustering separately to an extent, but there are issues of ambiguity in assigning types. Duff emphasized cross-section shape and the elaboration of the tang. We propose a new classification system that emphasizes technological and functional features of the adzes. There is considerable agreement between Duff 2 ̆ 7 s system and ours, as different manufacturing methods create different cross-section shapes, and functional modifications are often related <b>to</b> the <b>adze</b> tang. We describe four main manufacturing methods with functional elaborations, resulting in nine different adze types that are represented by at least 3 specimens each at Wairau Bar. Examples of each of these adze types are illustrated. We also note the presence of 2 ̆ 7 stitched 2 ̆ 7 edges on some adzes likely resulting from fine punch work. The Wairau Bar adzes are some of the finest examples of knapping skill known anywhere in the world and suggest a high level of craft specialization...|$|R
50|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used adzes for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). Northwest coast adzes take two forms: hafted and D-handle. The hafted form {{is similar in}} form <b>to</b> a European <b>adze</b> with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. The thin end is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an adze iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. The second form is the D-handle adze which is basically an adze iron with a directly attached handle. The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage. Northwest coast adzes are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. As with European adzes, iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. Where larger Northwest adzes are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such {{that they can be}} used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.|$|R

2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of <b>adzes</b> <b>to</b> effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Kelly tool, the Halligan is a {{multipurpose}} tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It {{consists of a}} claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors. Either the adze end or fork end of the tool {{can be used to}} break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and doorjamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat-head axe. The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a [...] "baseball bat swing" [...] to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure <b>to</b> the <b>adze.</b> Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze, only when properly used provide protectionto the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation. The Halligan can be used to knock down a wall in a house to get to another area. The halligan {{can be used to make}} a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery. The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilationThe pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free. It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation. Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled. The fork end is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves. The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication among other things. The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident. The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level. The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the general}} {{impression}} of these tools {{were based on}} ideal (or classic) pieces that were of such perfect shape that they {{caught the attention of}} non-experts. Their typology broadened the term's [...] meaning. Biface hand axe and bifacial lithic items are distinguished. A hand axe need not be a bifacial item and many bifacial items are not hand axes. Nor were hand axes and bifacial items exclusive to the Lower Palaeolithic period in the Old World. They appear throughout the world and in many different pre-historical epochs, without necessarily implying an ancient origin. Lithic typology is not a reliable chronological reference and was abandoned as a dating system. Examples of this include the [...] "quasi-bifaces" [...] that sometimes appear in strata from the Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian periods in France and Spain, the crude bifacial pieces of the Lupemban culture (9000B.C.) or the [...] tools found near Sagua La Grande in Cuba. The word biface refers to something different in English than biface in French or bifaz in Spanish, which could lead to many misunderstandings. Bifacially carved cutting tools, similar to hand axes, were used to clear scrub vegetation throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. These tools are similar <b>to</b> more modern <b>adzes</b> and were a cheaper alternative to polished axes. The modern day villages along the Sepik river in New Guinea continue to use tools that are virtually identical to hand axes to clear forest. [...] "The term biface should be reserved for items from before the Würm II-III interstadial", although certain later objects could exceptionally be called bifaces.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 134 - 166. Southern African {{archaeology}} {{has experienced}} several changes in theoretical perspectives {{over the past}} few decades. More recently there have been renewed calls for a more social and theoretical approach to the analysis of the prehistoric past, especially the Late Stone Age. This thesis is an account of the last 4000 years in the southwestern Cape, where material culture is analysed in terms of contextual meaning. Contextual meaning is used in conjunction with social identity theory to analyse the interaction between Khoi herders and San gatherer-hunters. I use the active processes of identity formation and maintenance to argue that both the isolationist and revisionist arguments have simplified the concepts of identity, where identity is seen to have a passive role in interaction. I argue that identity is dynamic and changeable, and that individuals have several social identities which are made salient according to the context of interaction. I use specific fine line images in the rock art to argue that these images, in conjunction with scraper styles, were used as strategies by San males to increase their self-esteem. I further argue that interaction would result in unequal gender relations and San females used specific <b>adzes</b> <b>to</b> reassert their gender identity within San society. I further argue that finger paintings and handprints may have been painted by Khoi females as part of their menstruation and/or menarche rituals. I use both the gender and social identities from the Khoi and the San to argue that these are interrelated and cannot be separated. I argue that interaction would result in unequal gender and social practices and these practices would be expressed in the material culture of that group...|$|R
