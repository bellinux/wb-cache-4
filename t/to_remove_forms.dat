40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} and disposal {{is an integral}} part of mining operations. Water must be carefully managed to prevent waterborne contaminants from entering the surrounding environment. Mining companies rely on regulatory compliance and social acceptance to continue operations. The Stillwater Mining Company operates two underground mines in southern Montana, the Stillwater Mine and the East Boulder Mine, to extract platinum group metals from the J-M Reef geological formation. The East Boulder Mine operates an on-site wastewater treatment plant to remove waterborne contaminants from the water pumped to the surface from the underground mining operations. The main contaminant of concern at the East Boulder Mine is nitrate. The nitrate is a residue of blasting operations and is highly soluble in water. This thesis research focuses on analyzing the current nitrogen removal efficiencies by the wastewater treatment operations to identify abnormalities and recommend operational adjustments to remedy atypical results. The nitrogen removal efficiencies were investigated using weekly wastewater treatment plant samples conducted for compliance purposes. The examination of this data identified anomalies in the nitrification and denitrification treatment processes. The initial denitrification treatment was found to have increasing ammonium concentrations in the effluent. This ammonium increase is unexpected and the cause is cannot be identified with the currently available data. A second anomaly from the data analysis is the difference in treatment performance between the two Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBRs). The Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors utilize nitrification and denitrification treatment cells <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>forms</b> of nitrogen from the wastewater. The two systems are identical, yet one MBBR averages 2. 8 times greater Total Kjehdahl Nitrogen effluent concentrations than its counterpart. This finding warrants further investigation into possible differences in aeration and mixing rates in the reactors. Treatment modeling of the existing treatment system was attempted to understand these abnormalities but could not be executed with the available data. This research identified gaps in sampling methods, monitoring capabilities, and sample analysis. These gaps could be easily remedied with relatively low costs. The additional data gained by implementing the recommendations could provide enough additional data to better troubleshoot the treatment abnormalities identified by this research...|$|E

40|$|The {{key feature}} of China's {{financial}} {{sector in the}} reform era has been a financial repression implemented by maintaining the monopoly of state banks.

Moreover, once in place, financial repression is persistent and hard <b>to</b> <b>remove,</b> <b>forming</b> a trap of financial repression. I propose that the key to beat the trap of financial repression in China is to break up the largest state banks into small ones. The two preconditions for this to be successful are proper restructuring central government public finance and appropriate dealing with non-performing loans...|$|R

The mostcommon filter, the Gaussian filter, introduces distortions when used on some wood surfaces, whereas theRobust Gaussian Regression Filter (RGRF) does not. Unfortunately, the computation time when using theRGRF is increased significantly because the filter works iteratively and involves all profile data points in theevaluation. A modified algorithm that reduces the number of datapoints in the weighting window is proposedin this paper. The effect of the RGRF with a truncated window is {{compared to that of}} the RGRF withouttruncation on profiles of sanded wood and plastic and evaluated as an absolute error of Ra and Rtroughness parameters. Various weighting windows were tested and it was found that a window equivalent to 1. 25 l (l being the filter cut-off length), gave negligible errors. The computation time is reduced significantlywhen the number of data points is limited by this weighting window...|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{filters are}} useful tools {{as they are}} {{commonly}} employed in surface metrology and dimensional metrology, serving for surface texture analysis and data smoothing respectively. Compared to the mean-line filtering techniques, such as the Gaussian filter, morphological filters have the merits of compact support, no need <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>form,</b> and being relevant to geometrical properties of surfaces. This paper proposes a novel morphological method based on the alpha shape. The proposed method has the advantages over the traditional methods that it runs relative fast, enables arbitrary large ball radii, and applies to freeform surfaces and nonuniform sampled surfaces. The theory of basic morphological operations and the alpha shape are introduced and the theoretical link between the alpha hull and the morphological closing and opening operation is presented. A practical algorithm is developed that corrects possible singularities caused by data spikes and reduces the amount of calculation for open profiles/surfaces. Computer simulation is {{used to compare the}} results from the traditional algorithm and the proposed one. Experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of using the proposed method...|$|R
