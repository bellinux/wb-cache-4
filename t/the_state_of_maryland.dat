5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative {{plans to}} transfer the NPS segment of the parkway to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland,</b> who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state's reluctance {{to spend the money}} necessary to reconstruct the parkway, {{which was one of the}} most dangerous roads in the NPS road system.|$|E
5|$|In Chesapeake City, the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway {{ends and}} MD 213 {{continues}} north {{as a part}} of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway which crosses <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland.</b> Past this interchange, MD 213 passes over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the Chesapeake City Bridge.

5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland</b> did not attempt to prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders.

5|$|The Governor of Maryland {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of the government of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland,</b> and is the commander-in-chief of the state's National Guard units. The Governor is the highest-ranking official in the state and has a broad range of appointive powers in both the State and local governments, as specified by the Maryland Constitution (1867, and revisions/amendments). Because of the extent of these constitutional powers, the Governor of Maryland has been ranked as being among the most powerful Governors in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The NavyJohns Hopkins rivalry was an American intercollegiate {{football}} {{rivalry between}} the Navy Midshipmen football {{team of the}} United States Naval Academy and the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football team of Johns Hopkins University.

5|$|The {{corporate}} {{ownership of}} the Baltimore Steam Packet Company changed again in 1922, when the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) formed the Seaboardâ€“Bay Line Company, which owned all of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, making the steamship company a wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL on February 6, 1922. In addition to the infusion of capital from the SAL, the Old Bay Line also obtained a $4.4million Federal loan to build two new steamers for the Old Bay Line: <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland</b> and the State of Virginia. The Old Bay Line's president, S. Davies Warfield, was named president of SAL railroad {{as well as the}} Old Bay Line in 1922.|$|E

5|$|As the Chief Executive of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland,</b> the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E
5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland.</b> Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605â€“1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606â€“1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|I-97 was {{constructed}} {{along the corridor}} of Maryland Route 3 (MD 3) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville. From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie, the Interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3, which {{was built in the}} late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s. North of there, the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass, a freeway built in the mid-1950s. The segment of I-97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two-lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s. The Interstate was introduced in 1979 after <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Maryland</b> successfully obtained Interstate mileage for a Baltimoreâ€“Annapolis freeway from the federal government. The state decided to build the highway along I-97's current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor, which has partial freeway access via MD 10.|$|E
