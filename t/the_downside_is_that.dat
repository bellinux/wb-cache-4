5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
25|$|Most hobs are single-thread hobs, but double-, and triple-thread hobs {{increase}} production rates. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are not}} as accurate as single-thread hobs.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, {{with the result that}} round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
50|$|The Blower Bentley was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Blower Bentleys consumed 4 litres of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> textures may {{not appear}} as sharp {{if they are}} {{included}} in the edge detection, and it must be applied before rendering the HUD elements of a game, lest it affect them too.|$|R
50|$|The Smith Carbine <b>was</b> {{unique in}} <b>that</b> it broke {{apart in the}} middle for loading and it used rubber {{cartridges}} which sealed the gases in <b>the</b> breech. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these cartridges <b>were</b> difficult to remove.|$|R
25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as parrotfish and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|E
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E
50|$|The Philadelphia Flyers {{become the}} first team to wear long pants. The idea was to create a more {{streamlined}} uniform with lighter padding, thus making the players faster. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players hit the boards faster after being bodychecked.|$|R
50|$|Android Central's Andrew Martonik {{likes the}} Shield Tablet, praising its {{speakers}} and the Twitch streaming ability. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tablet <b>is</b> heavier than its competitor (390g to the Nexus 7's 290g) {{and it may}} be too expensive for some (the tablet is $299 to $399, the controller is $59, and the cover is $39). The Shield Tablet K1 released in late 2015 comes without a charger or stylus.|$|R
50|$|These {{batteries}} {{could allow}} electric cars to travel 500 miles before recharging. Replacing the liquid electrodes could {{only take a}} few minutes while recharging batteries takes much longer. These batteries don't have the problems of short circuits and overheating. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> nanoparticles degrade quickly, the technology is new and needs more development, they need to focus on cheaper production, and refilling stations would cost a lot to build.|$|R
2500|$|Multi-choice procedure. [...] A softer option, {{when the}} parties {{do not wish}} to commit {{themselves}} to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved. [...] The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise. [...] <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an arbitrator) to impose one of the options upon them.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{choice of}} engine systems remains {{somewhat}} controversial at this point. The concept was originally for an integrated power system (IPS) based on in-hull permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMMs), with Advanced Induction Motors (AIM) {{as a possible}} backup solution. The design was shifted to the AIM system in February 2005 {{in order to meet}} scheduled milestones; PMM technical issues were subsequently fixed, but the program has moved on. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> AIM technology has a heavier motor, requires more space, requires a [...] "separate controller" [...] to be developed to meet noise requirements, and produces one-third the amount of voltage. On the other hand, these very differences will force time and cost penalties from design and construction changes if the program wishes to [...] "design AIM out" [...] … ...|$|E
2500|$|Albuquerque has {{expanded}} greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During {{those years of}} expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post 1940s areas. These older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four to six lane roads in a 1mile(1.61km) grid. Each 1square mile(2.59km²) is divided into four [...] neighborhoods by smaller roads set 0.5miles(0.8km) between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from {{the worst of the}} noise and lights on the major roads. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is virtually impossible to}} go anywhere from home without driving.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> published and I got a readership, ... <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet? It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|R
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it had not been}} tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|R
50|$|Integrating {{the lens}} {{within the body}} of the camera had both {{positive}} and negative effects. On the positive side, it meant the optical nodal point of the camera was close to the centre of gravity, which could make operation easier and more instinctive when used on movable camera mounts such as pedestals. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> lens manufacturers <b>were</b> limited to which lenses they could adapt to fit to the camera. This made the 2001 less attractive for outside broadcasts.|$|R
2500|$|XM also {{provided}} data {{services such as}} weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its Sirius XM Weather & Emergency datacasting service. This up to the minute weather information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver. Unlike weather radar, which relies on the aircraft's own equipment, the satellite service could give a pilot information about weather anywhere in USA and Canada. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the various weather streams (radar, cloud coverage, lightning, forecast, TAF, FA, etc...) took around 15 minutes to complete the data download, meaning that the information can be somewhat out-of-date {{by the time it}} is shown. In-cockpit radar and lightning receivers returned truly realtime information, but they cost thousands of dollars, did not provide forecasts, nor did they provide complete weather reports. FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) were also available and shown. [...] Certain aircraft had the XM radio service provided to the aircraft's audio system, which allowed passengers to listen to XM radio while flying.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly {{encounter}} Cain and Abel, {{the latter}} {{with a rock}} stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. [...] There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being tight again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, The Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. [...] <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), takes Beverly and Howard {{to be on the}} Iprah Show with the topic [...] "Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It", guest starring Dr. Phlip. [...] Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. [...] Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. [...] Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. [...] Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). [...] Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. [...] Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be [...] "God". A few years later he was reunited with his parents and brother at a baseball game in Dakvorlde.|$|E
50|$|Competitive {{swimming}} wetsuits {{are made}} of the most expanded foam; {{they have to be}} very flexible to allow the swimmer unrestricted movement. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are quite fragile.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{technique is}} applying only projective transformation to the images for each eye (simulating rotation of <b>the</b> eye). <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> this approach cannot {{take into account}} the translation (changes in position) of the head. And the rotation can only happen around the axis of the eyeball, instead of the neck, which is the true axis for head rotation. When applied multiple times to a single frame, this causes [...] "positional judder", because position is not updated with every frame.|$|R
5000|$|Against the {{background}} of the developments in Europe, CRC was able to persuade the Canadian government to develop the system into a fully-fledged service. In August 1978 the Canadian Department of Communications publicly launched it as Telidon, a [...] "second generation" [...] videotex/teletext service, and committed to a four-year development plan to encourage rollout. Compared to the European systems, Telidon offered real graphics, as opposed to block-mosaic character graphics. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring Zilog Z80 or Motorola 6809 processors.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} to this design, {{compared to the}} {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) MAR, was twofold. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> far cheaper to build, as the only component built on a large scale were the phase shifters, which were relatively inexpensive compared to the active modules of the MAR. The other <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it dramatically reduced the wiring complexity as the shifters were wired in vertical rows instead of individually. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system could no longer produce multiple beams, which <b>is</b> the capability <b>that</b> allowed the MAR to handle multiple functions of tracking and discrimination. In comparison, the MSR was really useful only for short-range tracking.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{listener}} only knows the intended recipient from {{the context of}} the conversation. Requires moderate signal quality for the radio operator {{to keep track of the}} conversations.|$|E
50|$|However <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the staff}} at Review Centre {{do not appear to}} take {{negative}} reviews or their potential effects on businesses very seriously which leaves the system open to abuse.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every {{separate}} {{window or}} tab will initially have an empty [...] property when opened. Furthermore, the property {{can be used}} for tracking visitors across different websites, making it of concern for Internet privacy.|$|E
50|$|The upside of {{this design}} {{approach}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{changes in the}} weight and balance could be addressed simply by moving the wing or re-shaping it, a common solution <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> used for decades in aircraft design—including the original Douglas DC-3 whose wings were swept rearward for just this reason. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft would have little hypersonic lift, so its ability to maneuver while re-entering would be limited and its cross-range would be about 300 miles. It could make up for some of this with its improved low-speed flying ability, but would still {{not be able to}} match the mandated 450 miles.|$|R
50|$|In September 1994, KTEN added Fox {{as another}} {{secondary}} affiliation just after that network {{had won the}} rights to broadcast football games from the NFL's National Football Conference, which were previously seen on CBS (airing locally on KXII) for many years. KTEN's owners {{were in the middle}} of bankruptcy proceedings at the time and gained additional monetary compensation from Fox. It also allowed KTEN the unique ability to show every single Dallas Cowboys game <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not available on cable television. However, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> channel 10 <b>was</b> becoming even more of a hybrid with three network affiliations (NBC, ABC, and Fox) and even more confusing to viewers.|$|R
5000|$|A company ship {{visited the}} Russian American {{outposts}} only {{every two or}} three years to give provisions. Because of the limited stock of supplies, trading was incidental compared to trapping operations under the Aleutian laborers. This left the Russian outposts dependent upon British and American merchants for sorely needed food and materials; in such a situation Baranov knew that the RAC establishments [...] "could not exist without trading with foreigners." [...] Ties with Americans were particularly advantageous since they could sell furs at Guangzhou, closed to the Russians at <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> American hunters and trappers encroached on territory Russians considered theirs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{tessellation}} of a cube with tetrahedra {{requires a}} choice regarding {{the orientation of}} the tetrahedra, which may produce artificial [...] "bumps" [...] in the isosurface because of interpolation along the face diagonals.|$|E
50|$|Character point-based systems, such as Hero System, allow {{complete}} {{freedom of}} concept. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in many cases, character creation {{is much more}} complex, making the GM spend {{a lot more time}} examining and approving each character concept.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the filter}} {{approach}} is a bit difficult to get right — in practice many applications have the filter applied at one place in the code, but the programmer accidentally uses the unfiltered input at another place.|$|E
50|$|The 6501/6502 {{introduction}} {{in print}} and at Wescon was an enormous success. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extensive press coverage got Motorola's attention. In October 1975, Motorola reduced {{the price of a}} single 6800 microprocessor from $175 to $69. The $300 system design kit was reduced to $150 and it now came with a printed circuit board. On November 3, 1975, Motorola sought an injunction in Federal Court to stop MOS Technology from making and selling microprocessor products. They also filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. Motorola claimed that seven former employees joined MOS Technology to create that company's microprocessor products.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> to this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{parenthood}} so {{late in life}} {{put pressure}} of the Grant's marriage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rent back tenancy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in some {{circumstances}} the tenant is only provided with a limited tenure tenancy, in some cases {{for as little as}} 6 to 12 months after which the landlord may seek possession of the property with only two months notice. In addition subsequent refinancing can see a new owner taking control, which adds tothe uncertainty of tenure.In recent years, the market for this option has swelled butthe openness or longevity of the companies operating in it can be questionable. In addition to short tenancy, the future of rent charged can be unknown.Such companies advertise in the same media as sub-prime lenders, supplementing this with door to door leaflet drops.|$|R
