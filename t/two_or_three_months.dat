5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The parents {{care for}} young birds for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after they fledge, but from August to November the juveniles {{disperse}} {{to find a}} territory of their own to occupy. If they fail to find a vacant territory, they usually starve. The juvenile survival rate is unknown, but the annual survival rate for adults is 76.8%. The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild tawny owl, and of over 27years for a captive bird.|$|E
5|$|Under Eyles's command Temeraire {{finally put}} to sea {{at the end}} of July, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, and joined the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Lord Bridport. The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the {{blockade}} of the French port of Brest, and Temeraire spent several long cruises of <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> at a time patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by Temeraires former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral James Whitshed.|$|E

5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of the 21st century, there was only a small, largely elderly {{community}} left in Syria. Jews were still officially banned from politics and government employment, and did not have military service obligations. Jews were also the only minority to have their religion mentioned on their passports and identification cards. Though they were occasionally subjected to violence by Palestinian protesters, the Syrian government took measures to protect them. There was a Jewish primary school for religious studies, and Hebrew was allowed to be taught in some schools. Every <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> a rabbi from Istanbul visited the community to oversee the preparation of kosher meat, which residents froze and used until his next visit.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

After debate about whether to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, Amiens or Antwerp, which Wilson likened to “our discussing strategy like idiots”, it was decided to deploy five divisions to Maubeuge. The following day Kitchener scaled back this commitment to four divisions and lobbied to deploy them to Amiens.|$|E
25|$|Measuring 19–21cm (8in) in length, {{this small}} vibrant and brightly {{coloured}} parrot is sexually dimorphic. The male has a scarlet chest, a cobalt blue face, and bright green upperparts.

25|$|Next, {{detailed}} information booklets were delivered to all {{households in the}} area (including many on the fringe {{who may have been}} receiving their TV from other transmitters- hence the importance of the on-screen warning captions). <b>Two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> later, the first stage of the switchover began with the analogue BBC Two replaced with the new BBC A multiplex. At some locations, during the period between stage one and stage two, BBC One, ITV or Channel 4 moved to the analogue BBC Two frequency where that channel's frequency was required for the digital transmission of Multiplex 1. At the same time, captions appeared on the remaining analogue channels reminding viewers of the impending switchover. Finally, the second stage saw the remaining analogue transmissions switched off and the other high power multiplexes switched on. Initially, this occurred four weeks after stage one, but starting with the switchover at Mendip in April 2010 onwards, this gap was reduced to two weeks.|$|E
