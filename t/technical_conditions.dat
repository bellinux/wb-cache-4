2500|$|Embedded contact homology, due to Michael Hutchings, is an {{invariant}} of 3-manifolds (with {{a distinguished}} second homology class, {{corresponding to the}} choice of a spinc structure in Seiberg–Witten Floer homology) isomorphic (by work of Clifford Taubes) to Seiberg–Witten Floer cohomology and consequently (by work announced by [...] and [...] ) to the plus-version of Heegaard Floer homology (with reverse orientation). [...] It may be seen as an extension of Taubes's Gromov invariant, known to be equivalent to the Seiberg–Witten invariant, from closed symplectic 4-manifolds to certain non-compact symplectic 4-manifolds (namely, a contact three-manifold cross R). [...] Its construction is analogous to symplectic field theory, in that it is generated by certain collections of closed Reeb orbits and its differential counts certain holomorphic curves with ends at certain collections of Reeb orbits. It differs from SFT in <b>technical</b> <b>conditions</b> on the collections of Reeb orbits that generate it—and in not counting all holomorphic curves with Fredholm index 1 with given ends, but only those that also satisfy a topological condition given by the ECH index, which in particular implies that the curves considered are (mainly) embedded.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{were mentioned}} by Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity, in a talk {{at a conference}} of Anglican bishops and laity at St Albans, UK, in 2003. He noted that [...] "a final solution [...] can be found only in {{the larger context of}} full communion in faith, sacramental life and shared apostolic vision". He specifically mentioned obstacles like [...] "lay presidency, the ordination of women, and ethical problems such as abortion and homosexual partnerships." [...] This position (with its emphasis on [...] "doctrinal belief") seems to be in line with the attitude of Orthodoxy toward Anglican orders. Kallistos Ware, for example, notes in his book, The Orthodox Church: [...] "For Orthodoxy, the validity of ordinations does not depend simply on the fulfillment of certain <b>technical</b> <b>conditions</b> (external possession of the apostolic succession; correct form, matter and intention). The Orthodox also ask: What is the sacramental succession and priesthood? How does it understand the eucharistic presence and sacrifice? Only when these questions have been answered can a decision be made about the validity or otherwise of ordination. To isolate the problem of valid orders is to go up a blind alley. Realizing this, Anglicans and Orthodox in their discussions from the 1950s onwards have left the question of valid orders largely to one side, and have concentrated on more substantive and central themes of doctrinal belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{requested}} close air support, {{calling for}} the waiting aircraft to drop napalm across 11 Platoon's eastern frontage. The Phantoms soon arrived; however, due to the rain and low cloud {{they were unable to}} observe the coloured smoke thrown by the Australians to mark their position through the trees. Stanley was forced to halt the artillery while the aircraft flew overhead, yet with Smith unable to establish communications with the forward air observer he wanted them out of the area so it could resume firing. Townsend directed the aircraft drop their payloads on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 instead, believing it the location of the Viet Cong command element. With the artillery beginning to fall again and D Company still heavily outnumbered, it proved critical in preventing them being overrun as the Viet Cong formed assault waves. Major Harry Honnor—officer commanding 161st Battery, RNZA attached to 6 RAR in direct support—served as Townsend's artillery advisor at Nui Dat and during the battle controlled the fires of the three field batteries, as well as directing the American medium artillery against depth targets. On the ground Stanley would call down the fire himself or would relay the direction of the assault, from which Honnor would select targets and order the fire, which was then adjusted by Stanley using sound ranging to bring it closer. Despite the rain and the soft ground reducing the impact of the artillery, its effectiveness was aided by otherwise favourable <b>technical</b> <b>conditions,</b> including the location of the infantry between the guns and the assaulting Viet Cong, the convenient range of [...] at which the engagement occurred, good communications afforded by the newly issued PRC-25 radios, the air burst effect created by rounds exploding in the trees, and the large supply of rounds stock-piled at Nui Dat.|$|E

The urgency of carrying out types of nondestructive testing presented in the article is determined by the increase of energy efficiency of transport systems of coal and mining enterprises, in particular, reducers of belt conveyors.

40|$|Currently, {{continuous}} {{monitoring of the}} <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures is in most cases reduced to control over indicators compared {{to a set of}} limit values. The monitoring system alerts responsible officers about the facts within or beyond permissible limits and saves files that contain the measurement data. Generally, data analysis is non-automated and carried out post factum rather than in the real-time mode. Systems of {{continuous monitoring}} of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures need improved data monitoring, analysis and storage processes as well as the system of their immediate retrieval. Besides, the above procedures need a thorough assessment. Obviously, any advancement of technologies improves data processing (data collection, analysis, storage, presentation); therefore, issues of monitoring and operation of a sustainable system are to attain a new level. The information support of the system of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures is viewed from the perspective of Information Flow Processing (IFP) and SCADAsystems. Contemporary SCADA-systems are widely used to control and manage the industrial environment of plants and factories. Peculiarities of the system of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures consist in the fact that this system does not produce any direct influence on the subject under control. Undoubtedly, certain features of the SCADA system architecture (alert generation, integration with DBMS) might be considered in the course of development of systems of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures. Systems of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures process basic interconnected monitoring events and generate more complex ones. Thus, the behavior of structures exposed to diverse influences may be considered in a new perspective. It is obvious that systems of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures require a data warehouse responsible for managing complex events, data storage and presentation. Data warehouses are to be the major component of systems of continuous monitoring of the <b>technical</b> <b>condition</b> of structures.
