5|$|After this tournament, the gambit {{finally began}} to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b> If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it</b> being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E

5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early {{control of the}} match by driving Orton into the {{barricade}} outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was able <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it,</b> and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E

This contradiction {{was noted}} by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner Bud Selig {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it</b> ending too close to the start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{returned}} from injury at the Royal Rumble {{as a surprise}} entrant in the Royal Rumble match, which he won, earning a guaranteed match for any WWE world championship. Following Jericho's victory in the Elimination Chamber, in which he won the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge speared him the following night on Raw and {{announced that he had}} elected to face Jericho at WrestleMania. Following this announcement, Edge began a campaign of surprise attacks on Jericho, spearing him on several occasions in an attempt to play mind games with Jericho. On the March 12 episode of SmackDown, Jericho hosted a special edition of his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, with Edge as the guest. Edge attempted to spear Jericho again, but Jericho was able <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it</b> and hit Edge with the World Heavyweight Championship belt instead.|$|E

5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b> A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came {{on a collision course}} with the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it.</b> Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E
5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} a {{dangerous}} situation, and seeing a need <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it,</b> they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E

5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>it</b> shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|E
