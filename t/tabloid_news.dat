5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British <b>tabloid</b> <b>News</b> of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E

Rowling, along with Nelson Mandela, Al Gore, and Alan Greenspan, wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown's speeches, the proceeds of which were donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory. After her exposure as the true author of The Cuckoo's Calling led a massive increase in sales, Rowling announced she would donate all her royalties to the Army Benevolent Fund, claiming she had always intended to, but never expected the book to be a bestseller.|$|E

40|$|The problematics of {{the public}} sphere, as firstly {{outlined}} by Habermas, has triggered many reflections concerning the metamorphoses in political communication. In this regard, {{one of the most}} prominent phenomenona approached in the established literature of media transformations refers to that of tabloidization. According to different scholars, not only are journalistic discourses heading towards a tabloidized style of reporting, but also these practices tend to hinder the creation of public spheres. The present study wishes to understand the relation between these two assertions and empirically, to test their validity on the Romanian tabloid media. Particularly, it aims at exploring whether the <b>tabloids</b> <b>news</b> coverage of the last presidential elections meets the general standards of what is called tabloidization; and if so, how this may affect our definitions {{of the public}} sphere...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} is unclear about which citizens {{support the use}} of referendums and how a referendum campaign can affect support for direct democracy. This study investigates, first, the factors that determine support for referendums and, second, the role of the campaign in changing support. This is done {{in the context of the}} 2005 Dutch EU Constitution referendum. A media content analysis of national media (N = 6, 370) is combined with panel survey data (N = 1, 008). The results suggest that those who felt more politically disaffected were more supportive of referendums. Furthermore, higher levels of exposure to <b>tabloid</b> style campaign <b>news</b> led to increased approval of referendums. In a second step, the mechanism behind this effect was tested using an experiment (N = 580). When exposed to negative <b>tabloid</b> style <b>news</b> about a referendum proposal, opponents perceive the assumed consequences as more of a threat. This threat perception increased their support for a referendum on the issue at stake as a means to prevent the proposal. The article concludes with a discussion about the conditions under which a dynamic like this is likely to unfold and when alternative explanations for referendum support apply...|$|R
