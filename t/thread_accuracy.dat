40|$|Measurement {{of thread}} {{surfaces}} accuracy {{is a subject}} of this investigation. The standard complex indicator of <b>thread</b> <b>accuracy</b> – the virtual pitch thread diameter (VPTD) is considered. The author previously developed and published the method of calculation of VPTD. This method is based on data, which are obtained from coordi-nate measuring machines (CMM). However, using this method the preliminary deter-mination of the thread axis position is assumed. Actually this case does not always occur in practice. This disadvantage limited the possibility of CMM application {{for the assessment of}} the <b>thread</b> <b>accuracy</b> significantly. Taking it into account, the additional method for the thread axis determination for the cases where the axis is located arbitrarily is offered in this article. This method includes two stages. One of them is based on the determination of average values of point cloud coordinates received from CMM. The second one is based on minimiza-tion (maximization) of objective function. The objective function, in turn, includes such parameters as parameters of thread location in CMM coordinate system. VPTD is used as the minimized (maximized) value. The concerned method is confirmed by computer calculations, which show sufficient reliability and «robust » algorithm of the accepted approach. Calculations were done with point cloud calculated theoretically by using other computer program, and also with points that were received from CMM in real mea-surement. This investigation determined sufficient minimum number of points to ob-tain the reliable result at the first most effective stage of the method. Thus, the research showed that for VPTD assessment the earlier offered method and the additional new method gives a possibility to use CMM instead of using gauges...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} <b>thread</b> <b>accuracy</b> in {{details of}} the machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, thread milling cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the thread milling cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength thread milling cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on thread milling cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end thread milling cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents thread milling cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth thread milling cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy. The data obtained can be used to correct tooth profile thread milling cutters to improve the accuracy of the obtained thread. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Empirical scoring {{functions}} {{have proven}} useful in protein structure modeling. Most such scoring functions depend on protein side chain conformations. However, backbone-only scoring functions {{do not require}} computationally intensive structure optimization and so are well suited to protein design, which requires fast score evaluation. Furthermore, scoring functions that account for the distinctive relative position and orientation preferences of residue pairs {{are expected to be}} more accurate than those that depend only on the separation distance. Results Residue pair scoring functions for fixed backbone protein design were derived using only backbone geometry. Unlike previous studies that used spherical harmonics to fit 2 D angular distributions, Gaussian Mixture Models were used to fit the full 3 D (position only) and 6 D (position and orientation) distributions of residue pairs. The performance of the 1 D (residue separation only), 3 D, and 6 D scoring functions were compared by their ability to identify correct threading solutions for a non-redundant benchmark set of protein backbone structures. The <b>threading</b> <b>accuracy</b> was found to steadily increase with increasing dimension, with the 6 D scoring function achieving the highest accuracy. Furthermore, the 3 D and 6 D scoring functions were shown to outperform side chain-dependent empirical potentials from three other studies. Next, two computational methods that take advantage of the speed and pairwise form of these new backbone-only scoring functions were investigated. The first is a procedure that exploits available sequence data by averaging scores over threading solutions for homologs. This was evaluated by applying it to the challenging problem of identifying interacting transmembrane alpha-helices and found to further improve prediction accuracy. The second is a protein design method for determining the optimal sequence for a backbone structure by applying Belief Propagation optimization using the 6 D scoring functions. The sensitivity of this method to backbone structure perturbations was compared with that of fixed-backbone all-atom modeling by determining the similarities between optimal sequences for two different backbone structures within the same protein family. The results showed that the design method using 6 D scoring functions was more robust to small variations in backbone structure than the all-atom design method. Conclusions Backbone-only residue pair scoring functions that account for all six relative degrees of freedom are the most accurate and including the scores of homologs further improves the <b>accuracy</b> in <b>threading</b> applications. The 6 D scoring function outperformed several side chain-dependent potentials while avoiding time-consuming and error prone side chain structure prediction. These scoring functions are particularly useful as an initial filter in protein design problems before applying all-atom modeling. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Protein {{structure}} {{prediction is}} limited by the inaccuracy of the simplified energy functions necessary for efficient sorting over many conformations. It was recently suggested (Finkelstein, Phys Rev Lett 1998; 80 : 4823 – 4825) that these errors can be reduced by energy averaging over a set of homologous sequences. This conclusion is confirmed in this study by testing protein structure recognition in gapless <b>threading.</b> The <b>accuracy</b> of recognition was estimated by the Z-score values obtained in gapless threading tests. For threading, we used 20 target proteins, each having from 20 to 70 homologs taken from the HSSP sequence base. The energy of the native structures was compared with the energy from 34 to 75 thousand of alternative structures generated by threading. The energy calculations were done with our recently developed C � atom-based phenomenological potentials. We show that averaging of protein energies over homologs reduces the Z-score from D � 6. 1 (average Z-score for individual chains) to D � 8. 1. This means that a correct fold can be found among 3 � 109 random folds in the first case and among 3 � 1015 in the second. Such increase in selectivity is important for recognition of protein folds.

Based on the initial equation of compatibility of strains, axial offsets of contact layer points and the sum of screw, roller and nut turn deflections are calculated; then, load distribution across the turns may be determined.
