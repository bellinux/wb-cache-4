5000|$|Princess seams {{are long}} rounded seams sewn into women's blouses or shirts to add shaping or a <b>tailored</b> <b>fit</b> to closely follow a woman's shape. They are sewn {{into the front}} and/or back of a shirt, and extend {{from the waist up}} to the arms. Princess seams are {{distinct}} from darts in that they form a continuous line and are a full seam. Darts, on the other hand, are folds sewn into the clothing to shape the resultant garment.|$|E

30|$|Third, the 3 D CAD {{modeling}} or rendering {{processes are}} often {{supported by the}} use of 3 D scanning technology, which is capable of producing real world measurement data for a variety of objects from small jewelry pieces to large building structures. A human avatar is often utilized in the 3 D CAD process as a “virtual dress form” for wearable product design (Sun and Parsons 2014). Such an approach would eliminate much of the procedures in traditional product development like various fitting sessions using live models. Alternatively, 3 D scanning procedures may be utilized in a reverse engineering approach, in which various object iterations or modifications can be made quickly based on scan data without having to develop the base model from the start. The turn around time would consequently become reduced in the prototyping process, particularly considering the streamlined design modification timeline. Such versatility also stimulates various bespoke designs that accommodate targeted end users with a customized design feature or <b>tailored</b> <b>fit</b> (3 D Printed XYZ 2013; Nike football 2014). Thus, the impact of integrating 3 DP in the fashion industry would thus result in a change in design prototyping efficiency and the ability to move toward mass customization.|$|E
40|$|Background: Primate neurobiologists use chronically {{implanted}} {{devices such}} as pedestals for head stabilization and chambers {{to gain access to}} the brain and study its activity. Such implants are skull-mounted, and made from a hard, durable material, such as titanium. New method: Here, we present a low-cost method of creating customized 3 D-printed cranial implants that are tailored to the anatomy of individual animals. We performed pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scans to generate three-dimensional (3 D) models of the skull and brain. We then used 3 D modelling software to design implantable head posts, chambers, and a pedestal anchorage base, as well as craniotomy guides to aid us during surgery. Prototypes were made from plastic or resin, while implants were 3 D-printed in titanium. The implants underwent post-processing and received a coating of osteocompatible material to promote bone integration. Results: Their <b>tailored</b> <b>fit</b> greatly facilitated surgical implantation, and eliminated the gap between the implant and the bone. To date, our implants remain robust and well-integrated with the skull. Comparison with existing method(s) : Commercial-off-the-shelf solutions typically come with a uniform, flat base, preventing them from sitting flush against the curved surface of the skull. This leaves gaps for fluid and tissue ingress, increasing the risk of microbial infection and tissue inflammation, as well as implant loss. Conclusions: The use of 3 D printing technology enabled us to quickly and affordably create unique, complex designs, avoiding the constraints levied by traditional production methods, thereby boosting experimental success and improving the wellbeing of the animals.
