5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can be attached. Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111. If the drug contains a radioisotope, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the isotope precedes <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the antibody. Consequently, indium (111In) capromab pendetide is <b>the</b> <b>name</b> for the above example including indium-111.|$|E
