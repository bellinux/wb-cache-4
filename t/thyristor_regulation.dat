40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{a circuit}} of an impulse DC electric drive with one controlled-rectifier {{that is a}} <b>thyristor.</b> <b>Regulation</b> of an average voltage value on an engine is carried out by changing frequency of controlling impulses applied to the thyristor. Calculation of commutating capacitance and inductance is given in the paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{specification}} {{concerns the}} supply of regulated DC high voltage power supplies for 120 kW (180 kW peak) each, {{to be used as}} anode supplies for tetrode RF-power amplifiers. The maximum voltage required is 6 kV, the maximum average current 20 A (peak current 30 A), and the power supply must be fed from the 400 V 3 -phase sustem with a <b>thyristor</b> <b>regulation</b> on the primary side...|$|E
40|$|The {{immersing}} {{electropump unit}} has been investigated. The mathametical {{model of the}} system the thyristor commutator of the immersing electropump unit - the well in the transient conditions has been developed. The device of the smooth start and break gives the increase of the middle working time till the failure by 1, 28 times. The program of modeling of the asynchronous <b>thyristor</b> <b>regulation</b> is {{being used in the}} study process of the Higher School; the developed diagram solution of the device of a smooth start and break has easily been built into the control stations SAUNA and CASCADE instead of the magnetic starter.

50|$|In 1980, these {{locomotives}} {{were the}} world's first multisystem locomotives with power <b>thyristor</b> pulse <b>regulation.</b> This regulation has minimal losses compared to older resistive regulation with much higher losses. This gave the locomotive its characteristic sound in three frequencies (the first is 33,3 Hz, {{the second is}} 100 Hz {{and the third is}} 300 Hz) when locomotive accelerating.|$|R
