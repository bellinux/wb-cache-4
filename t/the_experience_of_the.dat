5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions.

5|$|In 2012 it {{was adapted}} as a two-part {{television}} drama for the BBC. The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and {{was directed by}} Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg's War Horse as a successful evocation of <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World War I trenches.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario 3D Land was {{designed}} {{to bridge the gap}} between 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games, and influenced by Miyamoto's philosophy of keeping the games fun in nature and making sure the player had the utmost opportunity to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. A main concern during development was making a game that would appeal to fans of the 2D Super Mario games as well as the 3D games; levels were designed so that the player would not get lost, moving Mario in one general direction towards each level's goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD. De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors and historians in trauma as a thematic subject.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality.

5|$|The ships {{built by}} AG Vulcan—Sachsen and Württemberg—were {{completed}} in three and five years, respectively. The two vessels {{built by the}} Imperial Dockyard—Bayern and Baden—, required eight and seven years' work, respectively. One of the primary causes for the great disparity in build times was <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shipbuilders. AG Vulcan was an established commercial ship builder, while the Imperial Dockyards were recently founded and still lacked experience in large warship construction.|$|E

5|$|Although A Company, 1 RAR {{had been}} mauled, <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australians at Gang Toi was {{relatively}} minor {{when compared to}} that of the Americans. During fierce fighting the US 1/503rd Battalion had suffered 40 killed and 51 wounded, while more than 400 Viet Cong were believed killed. American claims were later raised to over 700 killed when captured documents revealed the losses caused by artillery and air strikes. Yet it was questionable as to whether such battles of attrition would be viable, while equally the American battalion had taken casualties far beyond what would have been politically acceptable for 1 RAR. Indeed, their losses had been significant, and although claimed as a victory, the Americans had failed to secure the area even if the Viet Cong had temporarily surrendered control of the battlefield. Ultimately, the communists continued to use the Bien Hoa area as a major supply route {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. <b>The</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the refugees to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, Durant {{received}} {{an invitation to}} the United States national team training camp. Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit. Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining players as the deciding factor in making the cut. Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and became their leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed. At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning MVP honors in the process. His final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, the Crusade {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky. Of the 113 individuals known by name to {{have been involved in the}} Crusade, 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery. Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusade had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade.|$|E
5|$|Laozi is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} author of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history.

As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, senses and desires.|$|E
5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year.

5|$|Raising capital proved straightforward, {{and it was}} {{possible}} to present a Bill for the line in the 1837 session of Parliament. There was strenuous opposition from river and canal interests, but this was overcome. At the time the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP) was also promoting its line, with a similar route from Tradeston to Paisley. It became obvious that Parliament would be hostile to the formation of two adjacent lines, so it was determined to build the line jointly as far as Paisley. Both the GPK and the GP received the royal assent on 15 July 1837. The Glasgow, Paisley Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway Act authorised share capital of £625,000, and £208,300 in loans. The line was to be constructed simultaneously from each end, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ardrossan Railway which failed to build the eastern end of its authorised line.|$|E

5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known due to <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, {{there was considerable}} concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E
