40|$|The {{separation}} of tantalum and niobium compounds {{has been of}} interest for many years, with few new developments. Classically separation is achieved by liquid–liquid extraction and most research focuses on optimising this process. A separation method that bypasses the need for liquid–liquid extraction is reported here. The process uses dry fluorination to convert <b>tantalum</b> and niobium <b>pentoxides</b> into metal oxyfluorides. The thermal behaviour of these species is sufficiently different for separation to be achieved by preferential volatilisation.

40|$|Hydrothermal {{transport}} and redeposition of tantalum by hydrothermal solutions to quantities suffi-cient for formation of its deposits was assumed by many geologists {{for a long}} time. However, the pos-sibility of hydrothermal transport of tantalum has never been demonstrated experimentally. In the lit-erature the reliable data about behaviour of Ta and Nb in hydrothermal solutions are absent. The deci-sion of this question has required of special experimental researches at T-P and the solution composi-tion corresponding to physico-chemical parameters of postmagmatic hydrothermal processes in the lithium-fluoric granites domes. This investigation is directed on the decision of a specific task of experimental study of oxide tanta-lum (Ta 2 O 5 -tantite) solubility in fluoride solutions at high temperatures and pressures for a quatitative estimation {{of the possibility of}} hydrothermal mass transfer and precipitation of tantalum at formation of its deposits connected with albitized and greisenized granite (apogranite) [1]. The experiments on studying dependence of <b>pentoxide</b> <b>tantalum</b> (Ta 2 O 5) solubility on F-ion con-centration were carried out at Т= 550 oС, P= 1000 bar in HF, KF solutions of 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mole/kg H 2 О, NaF solutions of 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0 mole/kg H 2 О and LiF solutions of 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 3 mole/kg H 2 О at the presence of the oxygen buffer Co-СоО.

40|$|High {{temperature}} and high electric field applications in tantalum and niobium capacitors {{are limited by}} the mechanism of ion migration and field crystallization in a <b>tantalum</b> or niobium <b>pentoxide</b> insulating layer. The study of leakage current (DCL) variation in time {{as a result of}} increasing {{temperature and}} electric field might provide information about the physical mechanism of degradation. The experiments were performed on tantalum and niobium oxide capacitors at temperatures of about 125 °C and applied voltages ranging up to rated voltages of 35 V and 16 V for tantalum and niobium oxide capacitors, respectively. Homogeneous distribution of oxygen vacancies acting as positive ions within the pentoxide layer was assumed before the experiments. DCL vs. time characteristics at a fixed temperature have several phases. At the beginning of ageing the DCL increases exponentially with time. In this period ions in the insulating layer are being moved in the electric field by drift only. Due to that the concentration of ions near the cathode increases producing a positively charged region near the cathode. The electric field near the cathode increases and the potential barrier between the cathode and insulating layer decreases which results in increasing DCL. However, redistribution of positive ions in the insulator layer leads to creation of a ion concentration gradient which results in a gradual increase of the ion diffusion current in the direction opposite to the ion drift current component. The equilibrium between the two for a given temperature and electric field results in saturation of the leakage current value. DCL vs. time characteristics are described by the exponential stretched law. We found that during the initial part of ageing an exponent n = 1 applies. That corresponds to the ion drift motion only. After long-time application of the electric field at a high temperature the DCL vs. time characteristics are described by the exponential stretched law with an exponent n = 0. 5. Here, the equilibrium between the ion drift and diffusion is achieved. The process of leakage current degradation is therefore partially reversible. When the external electric field is lowered, or the samples are shortened, the leakage current for a given voltage decreases with time and the DCL vs. time characteristics are described by the exponential stretched law with an exponent n = 0. 5, thus the ion redistribution by diffusion becomes dominant...|$|R
25|$|With {{a reverse}} voltage applied, a reverse leakage current flows in very small areas of {{microcracks}} or other defects across the dielectric layer to the anode of the electrolytic capacitor. Although the current {{may only be}} a few microamps, it represents a very high localized current density which can cause a tiny hot-spot. This can cause some conversion of amorphous <b>tantalum</b> <b>pentoxide</b> to the more conductive crystalline form. When a high current is available, this effect can avalanche and the capacitor may become a total short.|$|E
