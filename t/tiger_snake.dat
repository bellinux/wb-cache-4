5|$|In captivity {{the green}} and golden bell frog is known to feed on crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, {{domestic}} flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small <b>tiger</b> <b>snake</b> being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form {{the belief that the}} frog will eat most things that move.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators include wading birds, such as reef egrets, white-faced herons, white ibises and swamp harriers. Other predators include snakes, skinks, red foxes, tortoises, and eels {{and other}} fish, such as redfin perch and European carp, several {{varieties}} of gudgeon, {{and a range}} of invertebrate predators, such as the large brown mantis. Predation on adult frogs has been recorded for the red-bellied black snake, <b>tiger</b> <b>snake,</b> laughing kookaburra, and sacred kingfisher; wading birds and other snakes, such as the green tree snake and the copperhead snake, are also believed to be predators of the frog. The relative magnitude of the various predatorial threats to the frog and its tadpoles is not known. Before the frog became rare, and when subsistence lifestyles were more common, it was hunted and eaten by Australian Aborigines. It was also used in dissection demonstrations in biology classes, and caught by humans for feeding pet reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the <b>tiger</b> <b>snake</b> (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E

50|$|The King Island and Tasmanian <b>tiger</b> <b>snakes</b> {{each have}} a blunt head {{distinct}} from a robust body. Younger snakes may be slimmer and similar to other <b>tiger</b> <b>snakes,</b> eventually growing up to 1.5 m in length. Dorsally, they may be jet black, jet black with lighter crossbands, grey with black flecks forming faint bands, or an unbanded grey or brown. The ventral surface is usually a lighter colour. Midbody scales are in 19, 17 or sometimes 15 rows, ventrals number 161 to 174, subcaudals 48 to 52 (single) and the anal scale is single. Tasmanian <b>tiger</b> <b>snakes</b> tend to be quiet snakes, {{probably due to the}} lower temperature ranges they inhabit.|$|R

25|$|Australia is {{the only}} {{continent}} where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species, including the fierce snake, eastern brown snake, taipan and eastern <b>tiger</b> <b>snake</b> are from the family Elapidae. Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia. Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia's northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they {{are considered to be}} relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake.|$|E

The battalion's part in this plan saw them land on Brunei on 10 June 1945 as part of Operation Oboe Six. Coming ashore near Brooketon, [...] the battalion took part in capturing the capital before dispatching companies to secure individual objectives in the outlying areas as the Australians advanced along the coast towards the oilfields at Seria. In mid-July, 'D' Company carried out a patrol along the Baram River on board HMAS <b>Tiger</b> <b>Snake.</b> On 13 August, following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the order to cease offensive action was received from 20th Brigade headquarters and two days later the war came to an end with Japan's capitulation. Despite this, it was not until 10 September that the Japanese on Borneo formally surrendered, and the bulk of the battalion remained deployed until the end of the month. During this time they were involved in ensuring all Japanese forces in the area received the surrender instructions and complied with them, and with collecting and escorting surrendered Japanese soldiers and former Indian prisoners of war, with the battalion's last operation being completed in early October. The battalion's final campaign cost 24 men killed or wounded.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Risley {{finds that}} both Kolarians, as the Sonthals, and Dravidians, as the Oraons, {{are in this}} state of totemism, like the Hos and Mundas. It is most {{instructive}} to learn that, as one of these tribes rises in the social scale, it sloughs off its totem, and, abandoning the common name derived from bird, beast, or plant, adopts that of an eponymous ancestor. A tendency in this direction has been observed by Messrs. Fison and Howitt even in Australia. The Mahilis, Koras and Kurmis, who profess {{to be members of}} the Hindu community, still retain the totemistic organisation, with names derived from birds, beasts and plants. Even the Jagannathi Kumhars of Orissa, taking rank immediately below the writer-caste, have the totems <b>tiger,</b> <b>snake,</b> weasel, cow, frog, sparrow and tortoise. The sub-castes of the Khatlya Kumhars explain away their totem-names [...] "as names of certain saints, who, being present at Daksha's Horse-sacrifice, transformed themselves into animals to escape the wrath of Siva," [...] like the gods of Egypt when they fled in bestial form from the wrath of Set.|$|E
