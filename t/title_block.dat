5000|$|In the beginning, {{the firm}} {{occupied}} the Meyerhofer {{facilities in the}} old Star Theatre at 842 Broadway, New York City.

After the loss of this plant to fire on August 15, 1911, they moved again, this time to 240 West 50th Street, and in September 1921, they built and occupied their own four-story plus basement factory at 321-325 West 50th Street. In 1962 they moved to a new, modern two-story plant at 32-32 48th Avenue in Long Island City. By 1966 an annex had been opened two blocks away to meet the press of business. By 1966 [...] "NY/LA" [...] appeared on drawing <b>title</b> <b>blocks,</b> denoting their last expansion, {{the opening of a}} branch sales/engineering office in Los Angeles under George Howard.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{work done}} in locating and extracting tables and their contents from document images. While most {{research in the area}} of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components such as <b>title</b> <b>blocks,</b> table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]. 1.
