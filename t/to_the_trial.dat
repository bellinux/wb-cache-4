5|$|In 1897, as Berkman {{finished}} {{the fifth year}} of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed to object <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for early release. The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was carted from {{imprisonment}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trial</b> of Penenden Heath of Odo of Bayeux, earl of Kent. This {{took place}} sometime between 1072 and 1076. At that time, {{he was the}} most prominent legalist in England. He helped clarify Anglo-Saxon land laws, as the trial was concerned with the attempts of Lanfranc to recover lands from Odo. The medieval writer Eadmer also consulted Æthelric for information on Eadmer's Life of St Dunstan.|$|E
50|$|The {{teams will}} play in a triple-knockout tournament, and four teams will qualify for the playoff round. The first two qualifiers and second two qualifiers will play against each other, and {{the winner of the}} first game will advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trials.</b> <b>The</b> loser of the first game then plays the winner of <b>the</b> second game <b>to</b> {{determine}} <b>the</b> second team <b>to</b> advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trials.</b>|$|R

5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and is probably the original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> A conclusion which relates the bishop's life after the trial is appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Savage sued his {{publisher}} for $12,000 in unpaid royalties. The publisher, Frank Tennyson Neely, who {{had filed}} for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client, argued {{that he did not}} owe Savage anything, instead, Savage owed him. Neely's scattered and incomplete accounting books prevented an easy conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> Three years later, Neely once again declared bankruptcy. In 1899, Abraham Lewis of Brooklyn sued Savage for $10,000 in damages, for stealing away the affections of his wife. Savage's own wife and a friend defended him in court, saying Lewis, an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage's command, was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but illegal act of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point.|$|E
5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} found there and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E

5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trial.</b> This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush drives in its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E
5|$|Research on {{the drug}} given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> {{participants}} reveals {{it to be a}} chiral chemical, with two enantiomer forms; one is the harmless and beneficial Proloft, the other is the dangerous hallucinogen which Black and the others ingested. Dr Miller tells Black that he had been working on drugs to cure his own visions, which he believes are similar to Black's. One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after he ran into the road amidst oncoming traffic, almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Doctor Who {{featured}} eight scripts by Davies, the remainder being allocated to experienced drama writers and previous writers for the show's ancillary releases: Steven Moffat penned a two-episode story, while Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, and Paul Cornell each wrote one script. Davies also approached {{his old friend}} Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to write for the series, but both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after securing writers for the show, Davies stated {{that he had no}} intention to approach writers for the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Robert Holmes, who died in May 1986, halfway through writing his contribution <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Trial</b> of a Time Lord.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Thomas Paine for seditious libel {{was held on}} 18 December 1792, in {{response}} to his publication of {{the second part of the}} Rights of Man. The government of William Pitt, worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a writ for his arrest issued on 21 May. Paine fled to France in September, having been elected a member of the National Convention in France. He was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a noted lawyer and orator who was severely criticised by government supporters in the months leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E

5|$|Use of {{insanity}} {{as a concept}} dates from 1324, and its criminal application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine insanity became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E
5|$|Unlike English common law, Chinese law {{held the}} community, {{rather than the}} individual, {{responsible}} for transgressions. Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu demanded {{the death of the}} culprit and was prepared to accept any sailor, whether innocent or guilty, to settle the matter. On 12 August, under an Act of Parliament of 1833, Elliot began a Court of Criminal and Admiralty Jurisdiction on board the Fort William in Hong Kong harbour, with himself as judge and a group of merchants as the jury. Two men were found guilty of rioting, fined £15 each, and sentenced to three months hard labour to be served in England while a further three men were found guilty of assault and rioting, fined £25 each, and sentenced to six months imprisonment in similar conditions. However, the Act was under review and after arriving in England, they were set free {{on the grounds that the}} trial held no jurisdiction. Elliot invited Lin to send observers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> but none came. Without the handover of a man to the Chinese, Lin was not satisfied with the proceedings. He viewed the extraterritorial court as an infringement of China's sovereignty.|$|E
50|$|Asclepiades of Antioch (Ἀσκληπιάδης) was Patriarch of Antioch and martyr. He succeeded Serapion as Patriarch of Antioch in 211. He {{was given}} the title of martyr, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> he endured during Roman persecution.|$|R

50|$|McRorie played third for Heather Fowlie (Rankin) at the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, and {{finished}} with a 4-5 record. As a member of team Bernard, McRorie once again made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> in 2009.|$|R
5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trial</b> of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of {{the heads of the}} former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War was {{a battle}} over not only {{religious}} and political beliefs, but also economic and social as well. This war was between Parliamentarians and Royalists and took place from 1642 to 1651, but was broken into several separate engagements. Charles I and his supporters experienced the first two periods of the war, which resulted in King Charles I dissolving Parliament, which would not be called into session again for over ten years. Reasons for this dismissal were because supporters of Long Parliament tried to install two resolutions into English law. One called for consequences against individuals that taxed {{without the consent of}} Parliament and labeled them as enemies of England, while the other stated that innovations in religion would result in the same tag. Each of these policies was aimed at Charles I, in that he was inferior leader as well as a supporter of Catholicism. This prompted the Puritan Revolt and eventually led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and execution of Charles I for treason. The final stage of the English Civil War came in 1649, and lasted until 1651. This time, King Charles II, the son of Charles I led supporters against Parliament. The Battle of Worcester, which took place in 1651, marked the end of the English Civil War. Charles II and other royalist forces were defeated by Parliamentarians and their leader Oliver Cromwell. This war began to take England in different directions regarding religious and political beliefs as well as economic and social. Also, the war constitutionally established that no British monarch was permitted to rule without first having been approved by Parliament.|$|E

40|$|Western {{pharmaceutical}} companies conducted clinical <b>trials</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Recently, media reports about alleged human experimentation provoked {{a wave of}} indignation. However, a scientific and objective account of these <b>trials</b> is lacking. <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} was to describe and evaluate <b>the</b> clinical <b>trials</b> performed in <b>the</b> German Democratic Republic (GDR) based on archival material from the health system and the secret service. We found documents relating to 220 trials involving more than 14 000 patients and 68 Western companies. However, no record of patient information forms or systematic documentation regarding the provision of patient consent was discovered. There was no evidence <b>to</b> suggest that <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> systematically and intentionally damaged patients. <b>The</b> <b>trials</b> were conducted without the knowledge of the public. GDR legislation stipulated that patients must consent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> but no evidence was found to suggest that patients were systematically informed. Documents suggest that at least some of <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> were carried out without patients having a comprehensive understanding of what <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> involved. <b>The</b> GDR agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> due <b>to</b> impending bankruptcy and Western {{pharmaceutical companies}} capitalised on this situation...|$|R
5000|$|Adaptive {{clinical}} trials use existing data <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> {{and then use}} interim results <b>to</b> modify <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> as it proceeds. Modifications include dosage, sample size, drug undergoing trial, patient selection criteria and [...] "cocktail" [...] mix. Adaptive trials often employ a Bayesian experimental design <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> <b>trial's</b> progress. In some cases, trials have become an ongoing process that regularly adds and drops therapies and patient groups as more information is gained. <b>The</b> aim is <b>to</b> more quickly identify drugs that have a therapeutic effect and {{to zero in on}} patient populations for whom the drug is appropriate.|$|R
