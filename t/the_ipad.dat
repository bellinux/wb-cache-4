5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air on October 22, 2013, sales of the fourth-generation iPad were discontinued. The fourth-generation iPad was reintroduced on March 18, 2014, following the discontinuation of <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> 2. In order to make its reintroduction a low-end device to <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air, its price was cut by 20% over its original launch price. On October 16, 2014, the fourth-generation iPad was discontinued in favor of <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air 2; <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air took its place as the entry-level iPad at that time.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Apple {{released}} <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air 2 and <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Mini 3. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> Air 2 is {{the first}} iOS device to feature a triple core CPU and 2GB of RAM. As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air, it features Touch ID and is available with a gold color option. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> Mini 3 is similar than <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Mini 2 in design and hardware, but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color.|$|E
5|$|After {{only seven}} months (221 days) of {{official}} availability, <b>the</b> third-generation <b>iPad</b> was discontinued on October 23, 2012, following {{the announcement of}} <b>the</b> fourth generation <b>iPad.</b> <b>The</b> third-generation <b>iPad</b> had <b>the</b> shortest lifespan of any iOS product. It is also <b>the</b> last <b>iPad</b> to support <b>the</b> 30-pin dock connector, as <b>the</b> fourth generation <b>iPad</b> and later use the Lightning connector.|$|R
30|$|One week {{prior to}} commencing <b>the</b> study, one <b>iPad</b> was placed at each play station for {{approximately}} 20  min {{each day for}} 1  week. Children had the choice of using <b>the</b> <b>iPads</b> without receiving guided instructions. This pre-exposure to <b>the</b> <b>iPads</b> was intended to remove any novelty effects that might influence a gain in numeracy skills (Gravetter and Forzano 2011).|$|R
5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPad</b> is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of <b>the</b> third-generation <b>iPad.</b> A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPad</b> by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation <b>iPad.</b> <b>The</b> performance increase of <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPad</b> varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPad</b> is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of <b>the</b> updated <b>iPad</b> 2 is able to outlast <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPad.</b>|$|R

5|$|Like the iPhone, {{with which}} it shares a {{development}} environment <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen. Developers may also create or modify apps {{to take advantage of}} the iPad's features, and there are one million apps optimized for <b>the</b> <b>iPad,</b> as of March 2016. Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.|$|E
50|$|Since fall 2012 HCCSC is a 21st Century School Corporation, {{meaning the}} {{students}} have a 1:1 technology advantage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to apply the {{lessons learned from the}} Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow studies, the SAMR model, and Diffusion of Innovations theory to explore stakeholder perceptions of iPad integration at an urban high school in Massachusetts. The implementation was viewed through the lenses of the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) studies (Baker, Gearhart, & Herman, 1990; Dwyer, Ringstaff, & Haymore Sandholtz, 1990 a; Dwyer, Ringstaff, & Haymore Sandholtz, 1990 b), Rogers’ (2003) Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) Model, and Puentedura’s (2012) Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR) Model. The researcher used qualitative analysis to code the data. Through data analysis, five themes emerged: communication, control, division, distraction, and workflow. <b>The</b> <b>iPads</b> changed how and when students and teachers communicated. Teachers sought more control over <b>the</b> <b>iPads</b> in <b>the</b> classroom. Control over learning shifted toward the students with the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>iPads.</b> Divisions became apparent with iPad use: new teachers versus veteran teachers and upperclassman versus underclassman. Distractions were rampant. <b>The</b> <b>iPads</b> influenced <b>the</b> workflow of how teachers taught and how students accessed the curriculum...|$|R
5|$|On October 22, 2013, Apple {{introduced}} the fifth generation of iPad, called <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air, {{and the second}} generation of iPad Mini, called iPad Mini 2 {{that comes with a}} Retina Display. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> Air went on sale on November 1, 2013, starting at $499, while <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Mini 2 was released on November 12, 2013, starting at $399.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, first {{introduced}} with <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of <b>the</b> <b>iPad.</b> The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover {{is meant to be}} more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of <b>the</b> <b>iPad,</b> and wakes up <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> {{has several}} uses in the classroom, {{and has been}} praised as a {{valuable}} tool for homeschooling.

5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>iPad.</b> The first generation established design precedents, some of which, {{such as the}} home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> 2. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. <b>The</b> <b>iPad</b> introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

The Wi-Fi version of <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service for <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that, effective June 7, the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on <b>the</b> <b>iPad</b> itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{offers several}} iPad accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.

30|$|All {{children}} were keen to use <b>the</b> <b>iPads</b> over <b>the</b> 10  days of mathematics lessons as {{they asked the}} teacher each day when the research team was arriving {{so that they could}} use <b>the</b> <b>iPads.</b> During <b>the</b> introduction to a new app phase {{at the beginning of each}} guided mathematics lesson, where the {{children were}} shown how to use an app (if they needed help), children did not use a headset so that they could hear the instructions (volume was turned down on <b>the</b> <b>ipads).</b> During this guided instruction, children were more apt to collaborate with each other to share what was on their screens and provide help to get to another level or step. When the children wore a headset, there was a greater tendency for children to focus on their own screen as they were not distracted by sounds coming from other iPads or giggles and exclamations coming from their peers.|$|R
5|$|By late 2009, the iPad's release {{had been}} rumored for several years. Such {{speculation}} mostly talked about “Apple’s tablet”; specific names included iTablet and iSlate.
