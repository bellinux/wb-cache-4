T. Buckland, launched a scheme <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> along the southern front of the city. He also planned a promenade behind the bund to beautify the waterfront and provide a pleasure walk.Accordingly, he convened a meeting of influential residents, explained to them the benefits that would accrue from the embankment told them that he wanted funds for it.|$|E
50|$|The oak {{woodland}} which {{surrounds the}} bog was planted c. 1860. There were two attempts to sink two mining pits in the 1830s and <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>an</b> <b>embankment</b> to the west. This {{did not come}} to fruition and was part of a plan to construct a railway which also failed. There was a threat in 1978 from a proposed Woorgreens open-cast mine proposal which was averted. This would have affected the water supply. The outcome was the control system now operating for the water levels between the two reserves. There is a drainage channel running through the centre of Foxes Bridge Bog.|$|E

50|$|The first {{practical}} experience of engineer Beleloubski was a construction project {{of a new}} railway line avoiding the station of Verebje, covering the period from 1877 to 1881. In fact, during the construction, {{it was impossible to}} eliminate a steep ascent and subsequent descent near the railroad station of Verebje (Verebushka) by technical means of that time. Passenger trains were able to overcome that mountain pass, but freight ones had to be uncoupled and moved by parts with double heading. This area was considered to be the most dangerous section of the whole line of the Nikolaevskaya Railway. The project of Beleloubski allowed to address several engineering challenges at once: <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>a</b> unique <b>embankment</b> 49 m high and to erect the bridge's pillars in the deep channel of the Msta river (similar to the Skytrail Bridge) using {{for the first time the}} caisson method.|$|R
40|$|The Paper {{contains}} {{information on}} existing dams founded on active faults, {{a summary of}} pertinent lessons learned from study of historic fault breaks and fault mechanisms, recommended practice for evaluation of active faults, and opinions concerning design of dams on active faults. While a dam site with an active fault should be avoided if possible, if a reservoir is vitally needed and a better site is not available, it is reasonable practice <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>a</b> conservatively designed <b>embankment</b> dam. Concrete dams on active faults, or near some major active faults, are not advisable. For evaluation of fault activity, geological studies usually must be carried a considerable distance from the dam site, a departure from recent past practice.

40|$|Compaction variables” (i. e. {{compaction}} technique, energy, molding water content) have a {{key role}} on the mechanic and hydraulic behaviour of compacted fine grained soils. An extensive project has been developed at the University of Napoli (Italy) {{in order to have}} a deep insight on this topic. In this paper the results of a experimental investigation, carried out to analyse the influence of the compaction technique on the pre-failure behaviour of a clayey silt, will be reported. The soil tested is a medium plasticity inorganic silt used <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>an</b> experimental <b>embankment</b> on Po river. Soil specimens have been prepared at different molding water contents. For each water content soil specimens have been compacted at the same dry density by dynamic (Proctor standard) and kneading (Harvard) compaction methods. The compaction curve obtained by the Proctor standard technique (ASTM D 698 - 91) has been used as reference energy curve. All the compacted specimens have been saturated at constant volume and then tested: monotonic cyclic and dynamic torsional shear tests have been carried out using a RCTS apparatus, always following the same stress history. Results have been analysed in terms of shear stiffness, damping ratio and their variation with confining stress and strain level. The experimental data obtained show that, for the Proctor compaction technique, specimens compacted at optimum water content show higher shear moduli than those compacted on both dry and wet side of optimum. The opposite behaviour has been observed in the case of the specimens compacted by the Harvard method. It seems that different moisture contents lead to different structures while different compaction techniques induce different anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|A 1, 500 ton {{temporary}} storage pile of water conditioned LIMB (Lime Injected Multistage Burner) ash by-product from the Ohio Edison Edgewater plant Lorain, OH {{was constructed in}} July, 1991 at a coal company near New Philadelphia, Ohio. This stockpile was created for dry FGD by-product material {{to be held in}} reserve for a land application uses field demonstration. High volume, beneficial uses of dry FGD by-products, such as for mine reclamation and embankment stabilization, will require temporary stockpiling of the by-product. Purpose for constructing this pile was to study changes with time in the LIMB by-product material when exposed to weathering. This by-product material was studied over a 2 1 / 2 year period. The water to control fugitive dust was added in the ash conditioner at the power plant while being loaded into dump trucks. Amount of water normally added in the conditioning process is close to the optimum moisture content of 40 [...] 50 % (dry weight basis), <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>a</b> compacted road <b>embankment</b> or road base. Four environmental operating permits required for construction of the storage pile were obtained, three from Ohio EPA (air, water and solid waste), and one from the Ohio Division of Reclamation (revised reclamation area permit). There was no significant environmental impacts from storm runoff or leachate water from the LIMB ash stockpile during the initial 18 month period through December, 1992. After 2 1 / 2 years of storage, the potential value of the LIMB material for use as <b>a</b> road <b>embankment</b> material or soil conditioner has declined significantly. Ettringite formation occurs. Aging allows the expansive reaction to take place before its potential use as compacted structural fill or embankment...|$|R

40|$|Meehan, ChristopherThe {{objective}} of the study presented in this thesis is to investigate the use of continuous compaction control (CCC) systems within an earthwork compaction specification framework. For this purpose, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) funded <b>a</b> field study <b>to</b> <b>construct</b> <b>a</b> small-scale soil <b>embankment,</b> utilizing CCC technology simultaneously with conventional in situ compaction verification test methods during the construction process. The material {{that was used to}} build the embankment classified as poorly-graded sand with silt. The CCC roller measured machine drive power (MDP) values, compaction meter values (CMV), and corresponding global positioning system (GPS) location values. For conventional in situ compaction verification, numerous density-based quality assurance test methods (e. g., Nuclear Density Gauge and Sand Cone) and modulus-based test methods (e. g., Lightweight Deflectometer and GeoGauge) were performed. A holistic analysis of the data collected from the field study was performed to assess the use of CCC systems in an earthwork compaction specification framework. The first goal {{of this study was to}} examine the possibility of using data recorded by CCC systems to monitor and control the thickness of compacted soil lifts during earthwork operations. During the field study, the compaction roller utilized a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) to determine the three dimensional location of the compactor in real-time. Data collected from the field study was then used to demonstrate how GPS measurements recorded by CCC equipment could be used for field monitoring of lift thickness. The use of simple and sophisticated geospatial interpolation techniques were examined for interpolating measured field elevation data onto a uniform grid for lift thickness evaluation. The approach that is presented can be used to build spatial maps of compacted soil lift thickness, which are a useful decision-making tool for field inspectors. The second goal of this study was to perform statistical regression analyses to compare the results of the in situ spot testing methods with the two CCC measurements (MDP and CMV) that were recorded during the compaction process. In order to accurately compare the in situ spot testing measurements and CCC measurements, Nearest Neighbor, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Ordinary Kriging interpolation techniques were utilized to predict CCC measurements at the corresponding in situ spot test locations. In general, regression analyses performed using the CCC predictions from the Ordinary Kriging method showed slightly higher correlations, however, the difference did not appear significant enough to outweigh the complex nature of this geospatial interpolation technique. Univariate regression analysis was performed first for point-by-point comparisons of the data and then on a data set which comprised of average values for each lift and pass. The point-by-point comparisons yielded weak correlations, while the comparison of the average value data sets showed much stronger correlations; this finding agrees well with observations that have been reported by other researchers. As other researchers have also reported that moisture content can drastically affect the compaction process and resulting density of soil, additional analyses using a multivariate regression technique were performed, which introduced the use of in situ measured moisture content as an independent variable. The results from these regression correlations showed generally much stronger correlation between the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements for both the point-by-point and average data sets. This observation provided confirmation of the influence of moisture content on the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements. The final goal of the study was to evaluate the use of CCC technology within an earthwork compaction specification framework. To accomplish this goal, implementation of existing CCC compaction verification acceptance criteria using the data collected from the aforementioned field study was performed. The acceptance criteria that were assessed include: spot testing of roller measured weakest areas, limiting percentage change in roller measured values, and comparison of roller measured values to in situ measured values. Each of the three acceptance criteria show potential for implementation into an earthwork specification; however, since the spot testing of roller measured weakest areas method still utilizes conventional in situ methods, it shows the most promise for immediate adoption and transition into CCC technology.
