5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|Hysterical Lydia, {{who thought}} Sarah and Zoe were having an affair, had a {{conversation}} with Charlotte and revealed when they split up, she attempted suicide, proving the character's vulnerability. After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> got the sabotaged parachute. While doing the jump, Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she hits the ground, Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Valiente {{became a member}} of a far right white {{nationalist}} political party, the National Front, for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also {{became a member of}} another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the National Front to lapse, sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party's opposition to women's liberation, gay rights, and sex education, all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain's intelligence agencies.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on 4 January, psychologists at Baxter {{contacted}} RRMHS again, and Glenside officials finally {{investigated the}} information sent {{to them in}} November 2004. On 7 January, a doctor from International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), a DIMIA sub-contractor, examined Anna again and suggested <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> schizophrenia, {{or at least a}} schizophrenia-related condition. On 24 January, DIMIA officials in Canberra discussed with Glenside doctors the possibility of committing Anna. The IHMS doctor again tried to assess Anna on 31 January, but he could not get her to cooperate, and, on 2 February, the doctor contacted a psychiatrist at Glenside, who said that Anna should be assessed under the South Australian Mental Health Act 1993 for possible committal. The doctor assessed Anna on the next day and, after consulting with the Glenside doctor, committed Anna.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2008, {{four more}} protesters left the grove, leaving three protesters {{still in the}} trees. At 11:00 pm three of the tree-sitters were seen on the ground, {{at which point the}} UCPD arrested one of them for {{trespassing}} and violating a court order, causing the other two to take refuge in a nearby tree. Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya talked to the two tree-sitters for a couple of hours, at which point they agreed to come down. One of the protesters who was talked down did so with the condition that they would be allowed to make a video statement. Another protester came down later in the day after indicating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> an undetermined medical condition that would require treatment. RunningWolf said that she collapsed three times once she was on the ground. RunningWolf blamed the conditions on the long exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and lack of sleep due to the lights the police set up surrounding the grove and the noise from the generators needed to power them. The university said they were happy that their strategy to get the tree-sitters to leave the grove was working. RunningWolf said that the remaining protesters would remain in the trees until at least 2008-07-17, when Judge Miller was expected to make a final ruling.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and was filmed on March 17–18, 2000 in Universal City, California. During its production, Spears was struck {{in the head by}} a falling camera and began bleeding. Spears' mother Lynne (who was present) suggested <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> suffered from a concussion, though she received four stitches and continued work after resting for four hours. Spears created the concept for the clip, commenting that [...] " [...] to be on Mars, dancing on Mars" [...] and [...] " [...] to be in a red jumpsuit". The final product premiered on April 10, 2000, on an episode of MTV's Making the Video.|$|E
500|$|Tamar outlived her consort, David Soslan, {{and died}} of a [...] "devastating disease" [...] not far from her capital Tbilisi, having {{previously}} crowned her son, Giorgi-Lasha, coregent. Tamar's historian relates that the queen suddenly fell ill when discussing state affairs with her ministers at the Nacharmagevi castle {{near the town of}} Gori. She was transported to Tbilisi and then to the nearby castle of Agarani where Tamar died and was mourned by her subjects. Her remains were transferred to the cathedral of Mtskheta and then to the Gelati monastery, a family burial ground of the Georgian royal dynasty. The traditional scholarly opinion is that Tamar died in 1213, although there are several indications <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> died earlier, in 1207 or 1210.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} poignant ruins on Hirta {{is the site of}} 'Lady Grange's House'. Lady Grange had been married to the Jacobite sympathiser James Erskine, Lord Grange, for 25 years when he decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> overheard too many of his treasonable plottings. He had her kidnapped and {{secretly}} confined in Edinburgh for six months. From there she was sent to the Monach Isles, where she lived in isolation for two years. She was then taken to Hirta from 1734 to 1740, which she described as [...] "a vile neasty, stinking poor isle". After a failed rescue attempt, she was removed on her husband's orders to the Isle of Skye, where she died. The [...] "house" [...] on Hirta which carries her name is a large cleit in the Village meadows.|$|E

500|$|Computer experts took a {{month to}} {{reconstruct}} the data to determine that the laptop was used {{on the morning of}} May 1 to search for websites related to Amtrak, Baskin-Robbins, Condit, Southwest Airlines, and a weather report from The Washington Post. Her final search at 12:59p.m. was for Alsace-Lorraine, a province in France. A particular search at 11:33a.m. was for information about Rock Creek Park in The Washington Post [...] "Entertainment Guide," [...] then at 11:34 she clicked a link to bring up a map of the park. Detectives later theorized <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> met someone at the Pierce-Klingle Mansion which houses the park headquarters. On July 25, 2001, three D.C. police sergeants and 28 police cadets searched along Glover Road in the park but failed to find evidence related to Levy. Later, a second attempt found nothing.|$|E
500|$|Bussolari's {{denial that}} she had {{discussed}} any baptism with Morisi {{raised the question of}} who could have reported the rumours to the inquisitor in the first place. On 6 March, Carboni interviewed Morisi again and pointed out the inconsistencies between her story and the testimony of the Mortara family doctor, the Mortaras themselves, and both Lepori and Bussolari. She replied: [...] "It's the Gospel truth". Carboni put it to Morisi <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> invented the whole story out of spite against the Mortara family {{in the hope that the}} Church might reward her. When Carboni asked Morisi if she had been to San Domenico apart from for her interrogation, she stated {{that she had}} been there on two other occasions to try to secure a dowry from Father Feletti. Carboni suggested that Morisi must have herself prompted the interrogation by recounting Edgardo's baptism during one of these visits—Morisi insisted that the interrogation had been first and the other two visits later.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} several years Heyer {{published}} one romance novel and one thriller each year. The romances were far more popular: they usually sold 115,000copies, while her thrillers sold 16,000copies. According to her son, Heyer [...] "regarded the writing of mystery stories rather as we would regard tackling a crossword puzzle – an intellectual diversion before the harder tasks of life have to be faced". Heyer's husband was involved in much of her writing. He often read the proofs of her historical romances to catch any errors <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> missed, and served as a collaborator for her thrillers. He provided the plots of the detective stories, describing the actions of characters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". Heyer would then create the characters and the relationships between them and bring the plot points to life. She found it difficult at times to rely on someone else's plots; on at least one occasion, before writing the last chapter of a book, she asked Rougier to explain once again how the murder was really committed.|$|E

500|$|When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and {{described}} her as [...] "living in humble, {{not to say}} somewhat squalid conditions". In a letter to her son, she admitted {{that in the last}} week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been shot by a stray bullet, she replied [...] "they tell me that you don't hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Such was her {{domination}} of the sport that there were persistent rumours that she was actually a man. These first surfaced immediately after her first match, when {{the members of the}} opposition Ottawa side accused her of being a man. The accusation was not unfounded in the league, where it was not uncommon for boys to be disguised as women to improve the spectacle. Some opposition teams went as far as removing Lapensée's hat during games to check how long her hair was. Her father made a public statement that the claims were false, and in February 1916, the Montreal Star investigated the claims. The reporter spoke to [...] "dozens and dozens of people from Cornwall who had known her since she was little", and concluded that [...] "from what he learned he is thoroughly convinced 'he' is a 'she'." [...] Despite this the rumours lingered, and some modern sources still speculate <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a man. In 2011, an article in the Cornwall Standard Freeholder claimed that [...] "we'll never know if Albertine was actually an Albert", suggesting the possibility that Lapensée was actually a draft dodger named Albert.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer likened {{preparing}} {{herself for}} the role to a musician preparing to record an album, describing the process as twice as much work. At one point, she confessed to Kloves that {{she felt she was}} performing terribly; Kloves insisted that Pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist. Producer Mark Rosenberg appreciated Pfeiffer for portraying Susie as a character who is [...] "so colorful and full of life that even Jack... has to perk up and pay attention". Pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers [...] "the scared kid inside" [...] despite her profane and world-weary introduction. Although Pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing, she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> [...] "outdone" [...] herself. Pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character. Pfeiffer identified Susie's first scene, in which she walks into her audition demanding attention, as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character's outgoing personality, which is different than her own introverted nature. A scene originally intended for the film in which Pfeiffer's character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about Jack was ultimately edited out of the final film. Pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano, fearing that it would appear [...] "silly" [...] and cause audience members to laugh. However, Kloves encouraged her to commit to the scene. Pfeiffer's short evening dress worn during the musical sequence was designed to be revealing enough without exposing Pfeiffer while she moves, which was choreographed by dancer Peggy Holmes. Pfeiffer touted her character [...] "one of the most alive characters that I've played", describing her as an [...] "emotional creature" [...] who is [...] "not afraid to take risks... doesn't lie to herself. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't blame anybody else. There's a purity in her honesty that I really respect", becoming a strong role model for the actress herself. Pfeiffer also credits Susie with helping her discover her own sexuality, prior to which she had felt uncomfortable exploring. According to the Orlando Sentinels Kathy Huffhines, Susie [...] "has a harder shell, a sharper edge, and a franker sexiness" [...] than previous characters Pfeiffer has played. According to film critic David Thomson of The Independent, the role of Susie allowed Pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography, prior to which had been [...] "dutiful" [...] yet [...] "routine".|$|E
