5|$|In Brooklyn {{during the}} 1980s, a heavyset, middle-aged woman walks alone meets a mysterious man who greets her and shows her {{the remains of}} a black leather jacket. The woman sobs at the sight of it, and the man begins to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> or event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E

50|$|Ancient Indian stories, {{especially}} the Jain Tales and Buddhist Tales have stories that go deep {{as much as}} three layers of <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> An independent and uncomplicated way of <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> within <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> within <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> However, the layers are never too long to lose the essence or deviate from the original story path for long.|$|R
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of}} the Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of Tātatau disappeared under heavy missionary disapproval, but was never completely suppressed. It {{is still very}} common for men (less so, but still some for women), to be decorated with some small tattoos. Nevertheless, tattoos shows one's strength.

25|$|Speaker and {{audience}} - Linguists will make distinctions within these categories; for example, the audience {{can be distinguished}} as addressees and other hearers. At the family reunion, an aunt might <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> to the young female relatives, but males, although not addressed, might also hear the narrative.|$|E

25|$|Geologic Time, {{created by}} artist Michele Oka Doner, {{consists}} of over 900 bronze medallions inlaid in the terrazzo floor of Exhibition Hall's lobby. The images <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> through pictures.

The medallions signify {{the passage of time}} and the connection between past and present.|$|E
25|$|Károly Mühlbeck (Nagysurány, 1869 – Sashalom, 1943) {{illustrated}} humor magazines as Kakas Márton, Borsszem Jankó, etc. He {{created a}} unique {{form of the}} comic strip, that headlined the newspaper, Új idők. These sequential drawings usually did not <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in chronological order, they rather showed a current topic from multiple point of views. These very popular works were collected in an individual album in 1935. In May–June 2011 kArton gallery held the first exhibition solely dedicated to Károly Mühlbeck's caricatures and comic strips.|$|E

25|$|High school {{students}} in every riding in Ontario were allowed to cast ballots in their classrooms {{as part of a}} student vote. While their numbers did not count in the official election, they did <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> all on their own. The student vote reflected change a lot more than the actual result, as well as widespread anti-conservatism. 93 ridings favoured the Liberals in the student vote, nine favoured the New Democrats, and one favoured the Greens, while the Conservatives were shut out. There was also a vote for elementary students.|$|E
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. She was much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, and she could <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
