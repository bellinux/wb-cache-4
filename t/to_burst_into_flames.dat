5|$|In 1983, Mary discovers Azazel {{standing}} over baby Sam's crib; {{he had been}} feeding his blood to the infant. Upon being interrupted, the demon pins her to the ceiling, slashes her stomach and causes her <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> Her death inspires John to dedicate his life to hunting down Azazel, {{at the same time}} training Sam and Dean to hunt supernatural creatures.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, JG51 was {{transferred}} East {{to take part}} in Operation Barbarossa with 1 staffel. On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and had a propensity <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
25|$|The third cell {{attacked}} {{an empty}} armored personnel carrier placed as a decoy before retreating, firing an RPG which damaged it and caused it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b>|$|E

25|$|On June 11 {{during the}} Axalta {{presents}} the Pocono 400, Johnson’s brakes failed causing him and Jamie McMurray to crash hard, causing McMurray <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> Johnson was uninjured in the accident.|$|E
25|$|While {{maneuvering}} 150 {{feet above}} the ground to attack the heavily defended airfield, 10-15 Japanese Oscar fighters orbiting in the clouds attacked from above, making numerous passes at the force over a ten-minute span of time. Several concentrated their fire on Cheli's bomber, causing its right engine <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> while still 2 miles from the target. The fire quickly spread to the nose and cockpit.|$|E
25|$|At Martinsville, Busch had bad luck. He crashed {{early in}} the race and after {{repairing}} his damages, successfully took the lucky dog free pass. But later, on lap 487, while running many laps down, Busch lost his brakes in turn 1 and slammed the wall hard enough to cause his engine <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> This brought out a 6-minute red flag. Busch was uninjured.|$|E
50|$|Dell posted notices to many {{of their}} laptop {{customers}} on August 14, 2006, saying that the Sony batteries on the D410, D500, D505, D510, D520, D600, D610, D620, D800, and D810 models were prone <b>to</b> <b>bursting</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames,</b> or even exploding.|$|R

Linus rejects Théano's love and vows to rescue Cléonice. In her anger, Théano causes the garden <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> but Linus prays to Apollo and the god extinguishes the fire.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August he was {{involved}} in four major air battles. During the first of these Mungo scored one Bf 109 destroyed and one damaged. In the day's third combat, over a convoy 'Booty' off Clacton, Mungo attacked two Bf 110s in quick succession and saw the first crash into the sea and the second go down pouring black smoke. He was awarded one 'destroyed' and 'one probable'. One further victory followed in the day's fourth air battle over Hawkinge, when his section was vectored onto a formation of Ju87s and Bf 109s off Margate. He led the attack on the 109s and his five-second burst into one of the fighters caused it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> and plunge into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Type Ones have lifespans of {{thousands}} of years, and can hibernate for hundreds of years. They also are surrounded by blue or indigo auras. These represent their life energy, and when the aura goes out, Type Ones almost immediately putrefy into stinking yellow puddles. Type Ones are especially vulnerable to crosses, which cause them <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Enforcer wore {{body armor}} with a silver-nitrate covered vest for {{protection}} from werewolves. He carried two [...]45 caliber guns with which he used normal ammunition, silver bullets, tranquilizer pellets, pyrogranulate capsules, and a [...] "tingler" [...] that changes the victim's metabolism, causing the victim <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame</b> by post-hypnotic command. He also wore a disintegrator amulet, later {{in the form of}} a ring.|$|R

25|$|Most Representatives of the South opposed Hamilton's {{plan because}} they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it. But more importantly, there were early signs of the {{economic}} and cultural rift between the Northern and Southern states that was <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> seven decades later, being that the South and its plantation-based economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to Northeastern business interests. Despite considerable opposition in Congress from Southerners, Hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790. The First Bank of the United States was thus created that year despite arguments from Thomas Jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while Hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government. Hamilton's other proposals, including protection tariffs for nascent American industry, were defeated.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with the enemy. While Maj. Cheli was leading his squadron in a dive to attack the heavily defended Dagua Airdrome, intercepting enemy aircraft centered their fire on his plane, causing it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> while still 2 miles from the objective. His speed would have enabled him to gain necessary altitude to parachute to safety, but this action would have resulted in his formation becoming disorganized and exposed to the enemy. Although a crash was inevitable, he courageously elected to continue leading the attack in his blazing plane. From a minimum altitude, the squadron made a devastating bombing and strafing attack on the target. The mission completed, Maj. Cheli instructed his wingman to lead the formation and crashed into the sea.|$|E
25|$|After {{destroying}} part of Tokyo {{with shock}} waves generated by her beating wings, Megaguirus {{heads to the}} waterfront and faces Godzilla. Being territorial, Megaguirus considers the city to be her hunting ground. As they engage in a lengthy battle, she uses her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, but Godzilla eventually uses his speed against her. As she flies toward Godzilla, it lunges forward with its dorsal fins in her path. She flies into the fins, {{and one of her}} arms is severed. Megaguirus, having been mutated by Godzilla's energy, generates a blast similar to Godzilla's atomic breath and knocks Godzilla down. Megaguirus speeds forward with the stinger on her long tail lowered, trying to stab Godzilla between the eyes. In a climactic moment, Godzilla catches the stinger in its mouth and crushes it in its jaws. Godzilla finally blasts Megaguirus with atomic breath, causing her <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> and die.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{few seconds}} a spark caught on the tinder, which began to smoke, and the girl, {{wrapping}} it in a bundle of dry grass, whirled it round at arm's-length until the draught caused it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame.</b> Thrusting the burning mass {{into the heart of}} the twigs, which had been previously prepared, she glanced up at her protector with a look that said plainly, [...] "Watch, now, the result." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{building}} roof, Kim {{is asked to}} stab Lonnie; instead, she stabs Fima. In anger, Fima pulls the knife from her stomach and stabs Ricky. A giant larva feeds on the wounded man as Kim's legs begin to get hot. Kim's hands knot themselves together once again, then they start <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame.</b> She then stabs her fused hands into Fima's wound. This transfers the curse of Lilith to her, and she dives off the roof just as her daughter had.|$|R
50|$|BATs are {{the perfect}} Cobra trooper. They never {{question}} orders, shirk duty or surrender. They are cheap and easy to replace. However, BATs do not react well to changes in field conditions, or discriminate well between targets. They will shoot at anything that moves. Cobra Infantrymen don't {{like to be on}} the same battlefield with B.A.Ts, and will sometimes dispense BATs into a losing battle, by kicking them out of low-flying aircraft without parachutes. B.A.Ts also have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame</b> when hit from behind.|$|R
25|$|On July 18, {{during the}} summer off-weekend, Earnhardt crashed a Chevrolet Corvette C5-R during a {{practice}} for the American Le Mans Series Grand Prix of Sonoma at Infineon Raceway. The car slid off course and hit a concrete barrier during warm-up {{the day of the}} race, rupturing a fuel line and causing the car <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> with him still inside. He suffered second and third degree burns on his neck, chin, and legs partially due to not wearing a protective balaclava with his helmet. The burns prevented him from finishing two races where he was relieved by Martin Truex Jr. (at New Hampshire) and his DEI teammate John Andretti (at Pocono) {{in the middle of the}} races. In the fall, Earnhardt became the first driver to sweep a weekend at Bristol by winning both the Busch and Cup races in the same weekend.|$|E
25|$|Crowds {{began to}} gather on Superior Avenue {{almost as soon}} as the {{shooting}} started. Superior Avenue is a major city thoroughfare which also carries U.S. Route 6. As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them. At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely. The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert. By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent African American males. About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A Molotov cocktail hit a marked police vehicle, causing it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames.</b> A commercial panel truck, driving down Superior Avenue, was stopped by the crowd, the white driver brutally beaten, and the truck overturned and set afire. A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 1943, Newton led a sortie on the Salamaua Isthmus {{in which}} his Boston was hit {{repeatedly}} by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, damaging fuselage, wings, fuel tanks and undercarriage. In spite of this he continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings, ammunition dumps and fuel stores, returning for a second pass at the target in order to strafe it with machine-gun fire. Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base, where it {{was found to be}} marked with ninety-eight bullet holes. Two days later, he and his two-man crew made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons. As he bombed his designated target, Newton's plane was seen <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames,</b> raked by cannon fire from the ground. Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines, he was able to ditch in the sea approximately [...] offshore.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, James E. Craig {{stood out}} for Mindoro Island to join Task Group 77.2, ordered to support landing operations on northern Luzon. Enemy reconnaissance planes maintained close surveillance; and late afternoon on 4 January an enemy suicide plane penetrated defenses and struck the , causing her <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame.</b> After the conflagration {{got out of}} hand, the escort carrier's commander ordered abandon ship. James E. Craig assisted in rescue operations and, later that evening, proceeded with other escorts and tankers to Mindoro.|$|R
50|$|While the cockatrice {{is often}} cited as having a stoning touch or gaze, pyrolisks rely on their own special gaze which causes any who meet it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame,</b> along with any nearby source of fire. Pyrolisks {{themselves}} are immune to all sources of fire. Unlike the cockatrice, which has an animal intelligence and {{is considered to be}} of neutral alignment, the pyrolisk has a somewhat increased intelligence, and is an actively evil creature. While it normally detests all creatures, its mortal enemy is the phoenix.|$|R
50|$|Obould Many-Arrows is {{the king}} of the Broken Arrow tribe. Obould is a large orc who is {{intelligent}} even by human standards. He wears a ridged suit of plate armor that is adorned with numerous spikes. In battle he uses a great sword enchanted <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame</b> at the wielder's will. His crown has four large rubies set into it each of which can generate a large fireball. His main shaman and advisor, Arganth, also made him a helmet shaped like a skull with a protective lens of the rare and supremely strong glassteel.|$|R
2500|$|... 6 April 1991: an off-duty RUC officer (Spence McGarry) {{was killed}} when he {{triggered}} a booby-trap bomb attached to his car by the IRA in Ballycastle, County Antrim. The explosion caused the car <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> and roll down a hill where it hit another vehicle which also burst into flames.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the Ford Pinto (where, because of design flaws, the Pinto was liable <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames</b> in a rear-impact collision), the company's {{decision}} was not to issue a recall. Ford's cost–benefit analysis had estimated that {{based on the number of}} cars in use and the probable accident rate, deaths due to the design flaw would cost it about $49.5 million to settle wrongful death lawsuits versus recall costs of $137.5 million. Ford overlooked (or considered insignificant) the costs of the negative publicity that would result, which forced a recall [...] and damaged sales.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} noted {{regarding}} behavior of transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under over-voltage conditions. Depending {{on the level of}} conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically, keeping the load connected, but now without any surge protection. [...] A user may have no indication when the surge suppressor has failed. Under the right conditions of over-voltage and line impedance, {{it may be possible to}} cause the MOV <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flames,</b> the root cause of many fires and the main reason for NFPA’s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, resulting in the opening of a thermal fuse or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.|$|E
50|$|The magician asks an {{audience}} member {{for a dollar}} bill, and then has them mark it in some way - signing it, tearing a corner off, memorizing the serial number, or similar. The magician then destroys the bill, ripping it up or causing it <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame.</b> The magician then introduces a lemon and proceeds to cut it in half. The two halves of the lemon are pulled apart and the original bill is found inside. The audience can then verify that it is indeed their bill by comparing it to whatever they recorded earlier.|$|R
60|$|As {{regarded}} {{a change}} of headship, a fresh individuality always has charms, and a new force would always strike out in some new direction. The man needed was one who would do something. General Booth did not fear but {{that he would be}} always forthcoming, and said that for his part he was quite happy as to the future, in which he anticipated an enlargement of their work. The Organization existed, and with it the arrangements for filling every niche. The discipline of to-day would continue to-morrow, and that spirit would always be ready <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame</b> when it was needed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other several rarely used abilities. Mjolnir can track {{a person and}} mystical items; absorb energy, such as {{draining}} the Asgardian powers of the Wrecking Crew into the Wrecker; or detect illusions, as Thor once commanded the hammer to strike the demonic Mephisto, who was hiding amongst false images of himself. As a former religious relic, Mjolnir is lethal to the undead, causing creatures such as vampires <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> <b>flame</b> and crumble <b>to</b> dust. Mjolnir also can project images, as Thor shows a glimpse of Asgard to fellow Avenger Iron Man. It is near-indestructible, surviving bullets, Anti-matter, and the Melter's melting beam.|$|R
