40|$|Four <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> species, Thunnus albacares (Yellowfin tuna), Ephinephelus striatus (Nassau Grouper), Cyprinus carpio (Carp), and Osphronemus gourami (Gouramy), were assayed for {{oxidation}} reduction potental (Eh) and pH {{in different}} temperature,i. e. ambient and chilled temperature. Every species has different pattern of Eh and pH values. Eh values of <b>tropical</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> {{were higher than}} <b>tropical</b> marine <b>fish,</b> however pH values four <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> have same trend. The rates of the Eh and pH changing in four <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> were faster at ambient storage and they were slower at chilled storage.

Here, we use underwater surveys on the temperate reefs of southeastern (SE) Australia and western Japan (~ 33. 5 °N and S, respectively) to investigate how temperate macroalgal and non-macroalgal habitats influence recruitment success of a range of <b>tropical</b> <b>fishes.</b> We show that temperate macroalgae strongly affected recruitment of many <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> species in both regions and across three recruitment seasons in SE Australia. Densities and richness of recruiting <b>tropical</b> <b>fishes,</b> primarily planktivores and herbivores, were over seven times greater in non macroalgal than macroalgal reef habitat. Species and trophic diversity (K-dominance) were also greater in non macroalgal habitat. Temperate macroalgal cover was a stronger predictor of <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages than temperate fish assemblages, reef rugosities or wave exposure. <b>Tropical</b> <b>fish</b> richness, diversity and density were greater on barren reef than on reef dominated by turfing algae. One common species, the neon damselfish (Pomacentrus coelestis), chose nonmacroalgal habitat over temperate macroalgae for settlement in an aquarium experiment. This study highlights that temperate macroalgae may partly account for spatial variation in recruitment success of many <b>tropical</b> <b>fishes</b> into higher latitudes. Hence, habitat composition of temperate reefs may need to be considered to accurately predict the geographic responses of many <b>tropical</b> <b>fishes</b> to climate change...|$|R

5000|$|... ==Aquarium fish== <b>Tropical</b> <b>fish</b> {{is a term}} {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} fish that are kept in heated aquariums. Freshwater <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> are more commonly kept than saltwater <b>tropical</b> <b>fish</b> due to the common availability of fresh water sources, such as tap water, whereas salt water is not commonly available and has to be recreated by using fresh water with sea salt additions. Salt water has to be monitored to maintain the correct salinity because of the effects of evaporation. Freshwater tropical aquariums can be maintained by simply topping up with fresh water.Tropical fish are popular choices for aquariums due to their often bright coloration, which typically derives from both pigmented cells and iridescent cells. <b>Tropical</b> <b>fish</b> may include wild-caught specimens, individuals born in captivity including lines selectively bred for special physical features, such as long fins, or particular colorations, such as albino. Some fish may be hybrids of more than one species.|$|R
