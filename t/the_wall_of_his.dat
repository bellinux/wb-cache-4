5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home office.|$|E

5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 {{the family}} {{returned}} to San Francisco. Arnautoff's first significant work after returning was a mural on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio, which he {{opened to the}} public. Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where {{he had been a}} patient) in August of 1932. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because the mural showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at eye-level. Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes.|$|E
25|$|The same year, Duchamp also {{attended}} {{a performance of}} a stage adaptation of Raymond Roussel's 1910 novel, Impressions d'Afrique which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Work on The Large Glass continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment.|$|E
25|$|Wes Craven {{began writing}} A Nightmare on Elm Street's {{screenplay}} around 1981, {{after he had}} finished production on Swamp Thing (1982). He pitched it to several studios, but {{each one of them}} rejected it for different reasons. The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to tone down the content to make it suitable for children and pre-teens. Craven declined. Another early suitor was Paramount Pictures; however the studios passed on the project due to A Nightmare on Elm Streets similarity to Dreamscape (1984), a film they were producing at the time. Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed their rejection letter on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office.|$|E

500|$|According {{to popular}} legend, after recanting his {{theory that the}} Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo {{allegedly}} muttered the rebellious phrase [...] "And yet it moves". A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words [...] "E pur si muove" [...] written on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death, but Stillman Drake writes [...] "there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death".|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the trial's {{outcome was}} mixed. [...] The Bulletin was outraged, {{as was the}} Canadian Civil Liberties Protective Association, which called Ives' {{decision}} to overturn the jury's finding one that [...] "set the clock back 300 years". [...] Both organized subscriptions to finance an expected appeal. [...] The Winnipeg Free Press called for an investigation of Ives for apparent favouritism towards Brownlee. [...] The Vancouver Sun, on the other hand, sympathized with the premier, arguing that his [...] "personal difficulties {{should not have been}} aired publicly". [...] Brownlee's political allies, including Irene Parlby and Henry Wise Wood, remained loyal, with Wood keeping a large picture of Brownlee on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guest bedroom.|$|E
