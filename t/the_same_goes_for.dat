5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E

50|$|Disney reunited the Robin Hood team in The Sword and the Rose (1953), with Todd as Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. It was not {{as popular}} as Robin Hood in the US but {{performed}} well in Europe. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> Disney's, Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.|$|R
5000|$|In this period, it {{was said}} of Charles XII that [...] "he could not retreat, only attack or fall." [...] <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> his soldiers. In the Swedish army tactics of that time, retreat was never covered, and they were obliged to attack or fight where they stood.

25|$|Apart {{from losing}} points from a house, serious misdeeds at Hogwarts are {{punishable}} by detention. Whenever a student loses a house point, their house jewels (ruby for Gryffindors, emeralds for Slytherin, sapphires for Ravenclaw, and topazes for Hufflepuff) are {{taken away from}} a glass hourglass located in every classroom. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> adding points to the specific house, although the teacher or prefect must conjure the gems from thin air.|$|E
25|$|Words {{are rarely}} not listed in {{dictionaries}} (in which case {{they would be}} lexical items) {{on the basis of}} their inflectional morphemes. However, they often are listed {{on the basis of their}} derivational morphemes. For instance, English dictionaries list readable and readability, words with derivational suffixes, along with their root read.

Desgranges enthusiasm, his sporting ability, his writing and the press work he had done for Clément persuaded the group to appoint him as editor.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flag was}} adopted by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 5 November 1996.

25|$|If someone {{creates a}} business, it is theirs for their entire life, {{and they can}} rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> farmers.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> {{readings}} of literary texts says Pommier. For example, Molière's Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons, {{not all of}} them, as Girard claims. Or again, Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote, but {{because he has been}} promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch, in Dostoevsky's Eternal Husband, has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival, so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavel's desire.|$|E
25|$|Municipal {{and provincial}} {{regulations}} may impact availability, {{in particular in}} Austria and Switzerland, which allows cities and provinces to regulate the selling of the least-regulated schedule of the SMG/BtMG. Individual chemists' shops can opt out of providing them or imposing volume, frequency, or single-purchase limitations and other things of the same store. Plain codeine hydrochloride tablets {{as well as other}} non-injectable forms of codeine and its midrange derivatives can be dispensed in this way; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> most chemical classes of benzodiazepines, the majority of non-barbiturate sedative/hypnotics, and at least a handful of barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, extramarital {{relations}} {{with a free}} woman were severely dealt with.

Female adulterers, and by extension prostitutes, were forbidden to marry or take part in public ceremonies. The average age of marriage being 30 for men, the young Athenian had no choice if he wanted to have sexual relations other than to turn to slaves or prostitutes.|$|R
5000|$|A gjenganger {{could have}} several reasons {{to return from}} the afterlife. Murdered people could seldom sleep peacefully in their graves. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>went</b> <b>for</b> their murderers. People who had {{committed}} suicide often came back as gjengangere, because Christian tradition held that [...] "self-killers" [...] were fit neither for heaven nor hell.

The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by NASA.

25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat.

25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> the experience of reading a single line of Homer. If you wish to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E

During India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh, talks took place between him and BCCI officials, and although it seemed he was the favourite to get the job, on 4 June 2007, BCCI treasurer N Srinivasan, a member of the Search Committee announced that Graham Ford and John Emburey had been invited for talks, hinting that Dav Whatmore was not under consideration anymore.|$|E
