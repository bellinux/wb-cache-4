5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the pride.|$|E
5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the climate of the period.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., in <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader {{able to handle}} the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> players in video games.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to give an insight of the {{construction}} of girls in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> friends and lovers in the Swedish magazine Julia. The magazine turns to girls of age nine to fourteen. The research questions were 1) What is the construction of the girls in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> friends and lovers about in Julia? 2) How are girls constructed in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> friends and lovers? Three issues of the magazine from the winter of 2014 were selected as material for the study. Critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992, 2010) was the point of departure in the analysis. The main findings of the study were that the magazine focused on that girls should have a love relation that is heterosexual monogamous and that the magazine encourages the girls to make friends. The magazine also described how girls should be in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> friends and lovers and what activities they could practise with their friends and lovers. The magazine’s construction of how girls should be could be discussed as if that leaves the readers, i. e. mainly girls, with a feeling that they do not have the opportunity to make several choices about <b>their</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, {{a similar}} series of games {{developed}} by Harmonix (who originally developed Guitar Hero), {{have altered the}} video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games {{to become one of}} the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the works}} of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written {{in the form of}} letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of {{literary}} naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature.|$|E
