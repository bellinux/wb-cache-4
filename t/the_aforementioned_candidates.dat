30|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> gene studies, a {{genome-wide}} association {{study was}} conducted in 396 isolated ICTEV patients and 1000 controls of European descent to identify novel genes for ICTEV (Zhang et al. 2014). The selected genetic variants from the genome-wide association study were further replicated with an independent cohort of 370 isolated ICTEV cases and 363 controls with the same ethnicity. The genome-wide association and replication study found an intergenic SNP on chromosome 12 q 24.31 between NCOR 2 and ZNF 664 that was significantly associated with ICTEV. However, Additional suggestive SNPs (Hox Genes, PITX 1, TBX 4, FOXN 3, SORCS 1 and MMP 7 /TMEM 123) and identified pathways were not significant in the replication phase.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{autoimmune}} {{thyroid disease}} (AITD) {{in which a}} number of autoantigens have been identified and characterized, the situation in thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is far from clear. A number of candidate antigens have been identified by probing Western blots of orbital tissue (OT) with sera from TAO patients, the most frequently cited being proteins of molecular weight 23, 28, 55, 64, 78 and 120 kilodaltons. In an attempt to identify autoantigens in TAO we have produced a lambda gt 11 human eye muscle expression library. This has been screened with sera from four patients with severe TAO whose antibodies bind {{to one or more}} of <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> antigens or to a thyroglobulin/acetylcholinesterase (Tg/Ache) shared epitope. Four clones were isolated and characterized; clone R 14 encodes the carboxyl terminal 193 amino acids of an IgE binding protein, clones R 10 and R 13 encode unknown proteins having significant similarity with heat shock protein 27 and the U 1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein respectively. Clone R 1 encodes an unknown peptide of 347 amino acids having no similarity with proteins in available data banks. R 1 clone affinity purified autoantibodies bind to a protein of Mr 78 kD in a Western blot of porcine eye muscle tissue. Autoantibodies to the R 1 recombinant lysogen were clearly demonstrated in 5 of 20 sera from Graves disease patients, its role merits further investigation. The possible relevance of these clones to the pathogenesis of TAO is discussed as well as the limitations of this type of approach in the identification of unknown autoantigens.

40|$|A lead {{slowing-down}} spectrometer (LSDS) {{system is}} a promising nondestructive assay technique that enables a quantitative measurement of the isotopic contents of major fissile isotopes in spent nuclear fuel and its pyroprocessing counterparts, such as 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and, potentially, minor actinides. The LSDS system currently under development at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (Daejeon, Korea) is planned to utilize a high-flux (> 1012  n/cm 2 ·s) neutron source comprised of a high-energy (30  MeV) /high-current (∼ 2 A) electron beam and a heavy metal target, which results in a very intense and complex radiation field for the facility, thus demanding structural shielding to guarantee the safety. Optimization of the structural shielding design was conducted using MCNPX for neutron dose rate evaluation of several representative hypothetical designs. In order to satisfy the construction cost and neutron attenuation capability of the facility, while simultaneously achieving the aimed dose rate limit (< 0. 06  μSv/h), a few shielding materials [high-density polyethylene (HDPE) –Borax, B 4 C, and Li 2 CO 3] were considered for the main neutron absorber layer, which is encapsulated within the double-sided concrete wall. The MCNP simulation indicated that HDPE-Borax is the most efficient among <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> materials, and <b>the</b> combined thickness of the shielding layers should exceed 100  cm to satisfy the dose limit on the outside surface of the shielding wall of the facility when limiting {{the thickness of the}} HDPE-Borax intermediate layer to below 5  cm. However, the shielding wall must include the instrumentation and installation holes for the LSDS system. The radiation leakage through the holes was substantially mitigated by adopting a zigzag-shape with concrete covers on both sides. The suggested optimized design of the shielding structure satisfies the dose rate limit and can be used {{for the construction of a}} facility in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic framework {{to evaluate the}} performance of conservation voltage reduction (CVR) by determining suitable substations for CVR in operations planning. Existing CVR planning practice generally only focuses on the energy saving aspect without taking other underlying attributes into account, i. e., network topology and reduced voltage effects on other substations. To secure the desired operating reserve and avoid any adverse impacts, these attributes should be considered for implementing CVR more effectively. This research develops a practical decision-making framework based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to quantify several of <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> attributes. <b>Candidate</b> substations for CVR deployment are prioritized such that performances are compared in terms of {{power transfer distribution factor}} (PTDF), voltage sensitivity factor (VSF), and CVR factor. In addition, to meet a specified reserve requirement, an integer programming approach is adopted to select potential substations for CVR implementations. Case studies for a Korean electric power system under diverse operating conditions are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is a pathogen {{that causes}} considerable mortality of the farmed shrimp, Penaeus monodon. Candidate ‘vaccines’, WSSV envelope protein VP 28 and formalin-inactivated WSSV, can provide short-lived {{protection against the}} virus. In this study, P. monodon was orally intubated with <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> vaccine <b>candidates,</b> and protein expression in the gut of immunised shrimps was profiled. The alterations in protein profiles in shrimps infected orally with live-WSSV were also examined. Seventeen of the identified proteins in the vaccine and WSSV-intubated shrimps varied significantly compared {{to those in the}} control shrimps. These proteins, classified under exoskeletal, cytoskeletal, immune-related, intracellular organelle part, intracellular calcium-binding or energy metabolism, are thought to directly or indirectly affect shrimp's immunity. The changes in the expression levels of crustacyanin, serine proteases, myosin light chain, and ER protein 57 observed in orally vaccinated shrimp may probably be linked to immunoprotective responses. On the other hand, altered expression of proteins linked to exoskeleton, calcium regulation and energy metabolism in WSSV-intubated shrimps is likely to symbolise disturbances in calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism...|$|R

[...] Miki. however, was the next one up to the podium, and he replied [...] "The person that the impotent candidate who stands before me calls a 'big-shot candidate' is the humble Bukichi Miki.
