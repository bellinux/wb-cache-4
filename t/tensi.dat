5|$|The Denver Broncos {{selected}} Pastrana in {{the eleventh}} {{round of the}} 1969 NFL Draft with the 270th overall pick. In 1969, he saw action in two games and did not attempt a pass, but did have one reception for 15yards. The following season, he played in five games, including three as starter in relief of Steve <b>Tensi,</b> who had suffered a shoulder injury. Against the San Diego Chargers, Pastrana drove the team to the opposing 35-yard line and within field goal range, but he was knocked unconscious and could not call a crucial timeout. As the offensive captain, {{he was the only}} person authorized to do so under the rules at the time, and the clock expired to result in a 1717 stalemate. The rules regarding timeouts were changed after the season. In 1970, Pastrana completed 29of 75pass attempts for 420yards and one touchdown, rushed 14times for 89yards and one touchdown, threw nine interceptions, and was sacked eight times. Five of his interceptions came against the Kansas City Chiefs. Pastrana suffered a severe concussion that effectively ended his career {{near the end of the}} 1970 season and also heavily altered his personality. In the 1971 offseason, head coach Lou Saban held try-outs with seven quarterbacks. By the end of August, Pastrana made the cut to the final three, alongside Don Horn and Steve Ramsey, and was the only quarterback remaining on the team from the prior season. Pastrana, however, was cut in early September.|$|E
500|$|Saban {{engineered}} {{a number}} of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve <b>Tensi</b> from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was [...] "my responsibility to the team" [...] and what while the club made progress, [...] "my only regret is that {{we have not been able}} to give Denver a championship". Saban's record as Denver's coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that [...] "They're killin' me out there, Whitey, they're killin' me!"

His biggest collegiate success came in 1964, his senior year at FSU. The Seminoles {{switched}} to a pro-set offense that year and had one of the highest scoring teams in college football, averaging nearly 24 points a game. <b>Tensi</b> threw for 1,683 yards and 14 TDs in FSU's 10 games, many of which were thrown to first-team All American and future Oakland Raiders great Fred Biletnikoff. Behind the <b>Tensi</b> to Biletnikoff tandem, and a defense which had four shutouts, Florida State enjoyed its best record up until that time, going 9-1-1. Their victories included a blowout win over #5 ranked University of Kentucky and the Seminoles' first win ever against the University of Florida. <b>Tensi</b> capped the season with 5 touchdown passes and 303 yards in passing (and four interceptions) in Florida State's 36-19 Gator Bowl victory over the University of Oklahoma.

5000|$|The Denver Broncos were in {{the market}} for a new quarterback for 1967. In 1966, they started four {{different}} quarterbacks and played a total of five. These five signal callers combined for a ghastly ratio of 12 touchdown passes to 30 interceptions, and finished last in the American Football League in scoring. On August 15, 1967, shortly before the 1967 season, new coach and general manager Lou Saban traded Denver's #1 draft picks in the 1968 and 1969 common AFL-NFL draft for <b>Tensi.</b> These proved to be valuable picks for San Diego, becoming the #4 and #9 overall selections respectively. <b>Tensi</b> started 12 of 14 games for the Broncos in 1967, who finished 3-11 and allowed the most points in the AFL. However, their offensive numbers were an improvement over 1966. According to former Broncos executive Jim Saccomano, Tensi's effectiveness and health in Denver was hamstrung by weak pass protection. In 1968, Tensi's football career took a major hit as his collarbone was broken twice—first in a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers and later in a regular season game. Tensi's injuries helped open the door for rookie Marlin Briscoe to play quarterback for the Broncos and become the first African-American quarterback in modern American pro football history. However, <b>Tensi</b> was back as the starting quarterback for 1969 after Briscoe was traded to Buffalo. But after winning only 4 of his 13 starts that year, <b>Tensi</b> was replaced as the starter by Pete Liske partway through the 1970 season. His last game was against the Oakland Raiders on November 15, 1970. After the season, <b>Tensi</b> recalled, [...] "The injury affected my shoulder, and I just couldn't throw with strength anymore. I told Lou (Saban) to find someone else. I was retiring." ...|$|E

5000|$|Comments by {{football}} scouts on <b>Tensi</b> late in {{his career}} noted his excellent size (at 6'5", {{he was one of}} the tallest pro quarterbacks of his day) but gave him mixed reviews in other areas.

He has a very strong arm and can throw long and he also has good accuracy on short routes. He can beat you with the bomb if his protection holds up, but he is not a good scrambler." [...] Another scout said, [...] "Tensi is just fair. He's a big tall guy who can throw the ball but he doesn't have the peripheral vision which allows you to look and pick things out. Other quarterbacks have better clarity of vision as far as seeing people in the secondary." ...|$|E
