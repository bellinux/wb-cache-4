As many as 150 police officers were on duty during <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire</b> burning from the Texas A and College Station police departments and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.|$|E
5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators {{turned a blind eye to}} an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire,</b> citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire</b> site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E

5|$|Although {{students}} protested Bonfire's {{environmental impact}} since 1970, no {{changes were made}} for decades. In 1990, student Scott Hantman asked <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire</b> leadership to help him address the problem. The group solicited volunteers, and {{in the spring of}} 1991, they planted 400trees. The tradition, Aggie Replant, has been repeated annually. The Replant organization became independent of Bonfire in 1994 when it gained its own Student Government Committee.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were {{constructed}} entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, {{when a student}} {{was struck by a}} swerving car. The same year (for unrelated reasons), Bonfire was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before Bonfire was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and <b>the</b> <b>bonfire</b> burned as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bonfire</b> Memorial Commission {{collected}} {{the hundreds of}} thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site of the collapse. At the Systems Building, Texas A leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left behind their Aggie rings, permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own. Various organizations also established funds in memory of the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded US$250,000.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire</b> hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

5000|$|Before 1928, <b>the</b> <b>bonfires</b> of Saint John {{had been}} celebrated in Alicante {{as it had}} been {{elsewhere}} in Europe: by burning old pieces of furniture on the night of Saint John on 24 June. <b>The</b> <b>Bonfires</b> festival in Alicante originated in 1928. Jose María Py, the founder of the festival, felt that Alicante needed an important fiesta, and came up with an idea to combine bonfires with a Valencian tradition known as the [...] "falles".

5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into <b>the</b> <b>Bonfire</b> Night of today.|$|E
