40|$|What {{limits the}} ability to attend several {{locations}} simultaneously? There are two possibilities: Either attention cannot be divided without incurring a cost, or spatial memory is limited and observers forget which locations to monitor. We compared motion discrimination when attention was directed to one or multiple locations by briefly presented central <b>cues.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cues</b> were matched {{for the amount of}} spatial information they provided. Several random dot kinematograms (RDKs) followed the spatial cues; one of them contained task-relevant, coherent motion. When four RDKs were presented, discrimination accuracy was identical when one and two locations were indicated by equally informative cues. However, when six RDKs were presented, discrimination accuracy was higher following one rather than multiple location cues. We examined whether memory of <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations was diminished under these conditions. Recall of <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations was tested when participants attended <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations and when they did not attend <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations. Recall was inaccurate only when <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations were attended. Finally, visually marking <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> locations, following one and multiple location cues, equalized discrimination performance, suggesting that participants could attend multiple locations when {{they did not have to}} remember which ones to attend. We conclude that endogenously dividing attention between multiple locations is limited by inaccurate recall of the attended locations and that attention poses separate demands on the same central processes used to remember spatial information, even when the locations attended and those held in memory are the same...|$|R

5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually <b>the</b> <b>cue</b> is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of <b>the</b> <b>cue,</b> the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented {{with a list of}} three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

Second, we modified <b>the</b> <b>cuing</b> procedure to reduce the incidental advantages for <b>the</b> <b>cuing</b> conditions over <b>the</b> control condition, by eliminating <b>the</b> arrows <b>cuing</b> task-relevant objects and by adding to the control condition an opportunity for participants to review the activity after encoding.

40|$|In {{working memory}} (WM) tasks, {{performance}} can be boosted by directing attention to one memory object: When a retro-cue in the retention interval indicates which object will be tested, responding is {{faster and more}} accurate (the retro-cue benefit). We tested whether the retro-cue benefit in WM depends on sustained attention to <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> object by inserting an attention-demanding interruption task between the retro-cue and the memory test. In the first experiment, the interruption task required participants to shift their visual attention away from <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> representation and to a visual classification task on colors. In {{the second and third}} experiments, the interruption task required participants to shift their focal attention within WM: Attention was directed away from <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> representation by probing another representation from the memory array prior to probing <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> object. <b>The</b> retro-cue benefit was not attenuated by shifts of perceptual attention or by shifts of attention within WM. We concluded that sustained attention is not needed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> representation in a state of heightened accessibility...|$|R

5|$|The 2006 World Championship {{began with}} O'Sullivan {{defeating}} Dave Harold 10–4, {{followed by a}} struggle through to a 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 {{at the end of}} the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip <b>the</b> <b>cue,</b> before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.|$|E

Note that “congruency” here refers to the decisions for the two halves, not whether either was changed. For example, if both <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> and uncued halves changed, this would still be considered a congruent trial because the decision is the same for both <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> and uncued halves. The misaligned images should in theory hinder any holistic processing and reduce the interference of the incongruent side, due to the increased physical disjunction of the two halves.|$|R
