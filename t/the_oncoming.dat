5|$|England and MCC captain Norman Yardley later {{admitted}} Barnes's close proximity {{throughout the season}} had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches {{because he was too}} close to react to <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July18. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum. Inland, as a precautionary measure, rail operations {{along the coast}} were halted for a duration of the storm's passage.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, 150vehicles evacuated out of Freeport, while water craft were taken up the Brazos River as far inland as possible. 100families in Caplen and Gilchrist were also evacuated. The 38th division of the Texas National Guard, stationed in Palacios, was alerted due to <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> storm.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{arrived in}} Paris on 20 March and governed {{for a period}} now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June the armed forces {{available}} to him had reached 200,000, {{and he decided to}} go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a microscopic traffic simulationstudy of the potential effects of an overtaking assistant fortwo-lane rural roads. The overtaking assistant is developed to supportdrivers in judging whether or not an overtaking opportunitycan be accepted based on the distance to <b>the</b> next <b>oncoming</b> vehicle. Drivers have been found to consider this to be a difficultpart of an overtaking manoeuvre. The assistant’s effects on trafficefficiency, driver comfort and road safety have been investigatedusing traffic simulation. The results indicate that this type overtakingassistant can provide safety benefits in terms of increasedtime-to-collision to <b>the</b> next <b>oncoming</b> vehicle during overtakingmanoeuvres. This safety benefit can be achieved without negativeconsequences for traffic efficiency and driver comfort. A driverassistance system that supports the distance judging part of overtakingmanoeuvres can therefore contribute to improved trafficconditions on the two-lane rural roads of the future...|$|R
5|$|With {{discipline}} breaking down, Spartacus {{turned his}} forces around and brought his entire strength {{to bear on}} <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> legions. In this last stand, the Battle of the Siler River, Spartacus' forces were finally routed completely, with {{the vast majority of}} them being killed on the battlefield. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield. However, his body was never found.|$|E
5|$|Around 7,000people in Cuba were {{evacuated}} to avoid <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> hurricane. Several shelters were opened by the Montserrat Red Cross on Montserrat, but few people sought refuge in them. Over 40shelters {{were ready for}} use in Nassau, Bahamas, even though Debby never affected the island. A total of 889people in the northern coastal plains {{were evacuated}} and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for the coming of Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total {{number of people in}} all five shelters only reached64. An additional 17people took refuge in an unknown number of shelters on St. Croix.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

25|$|There are {{detailed}} traffic {{rules for}} the canal. Each vessel in passage is classified in one of six traffic groups according to its dimensions. Larger ships are obliged to accept pilots and specialised canal helmsmen, in some cases even {{the assistance of a}} tugboat. Furthermore, there are regulations regarding <b>the</b> passing of <b>oncoming</b> ships. Larger ships may also be required to moor at the bollards provided at intervals along the canal to allow <b>the</b> passage of <b>oncoming</b> vessels. Special rules apply to pleasure craft.|$|R
5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He {{performed}} relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was located}} {{on one of}} the main frontiers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1434 until its {{annexation}} by the Russian Empire in 1793, the castle {{played a major role in}} the defense against <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> Cossack, Ottoman and Tatar invasions; from the 15th through 17th centuries, the castle was attacked by Tatar hordes a total of 51 times. The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. <b>The</b> <b>oncoming</b> winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E

5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat of rough seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm, but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> winter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, <b>the</b> <b>oncoming</b> lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 1984, a 48-year-old {{woman was}} killed when she was thrown from a Matterhorn Bobsled car and struck by <b>the</b> next <b>oncoming</b> bobsled. <b>The</b> spot where she was killed is now called [...] "Dolly's Drop" [...] by castmembers.
