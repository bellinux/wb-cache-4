5|$|All of SR 607 {{is located}} in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the {{intersection}} of SR60 near McConnelsville. SR607 travels north {{for the majority of the}} length. SR 607 passes near an Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR607 meets Township Road 696 in a <b>T-intersection,</b> where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR78 at another <b>T-intersection.</b> The route goes through mostly forests and small hills. In 2012, ODOT calculated 1,975 vehicles traveling south of McGovern Lane. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the economy, defense and mobility of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{exit from}} the complex to the Howard Beach {{neighborhood}} is on the west side, with a twisting staircase and two elevators {{going down to the}} east side of 103rd Street/Coleman Square by the <b>T-intersection</b> with 159th Avenue. A connecting bridge {{on the east side of}} the station leads into the Airtrain JFK station.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{starts at}} a <b>T-intersection</b> with US 61, {{a part of}} the Great River Road, north of Redwood. It then travels southwestward, {{adjacent}} to the Yazoo River. MS 465 then intersects Old Twin Lake Road in the village of Twin Lake, which is surrounded by a mix of forests and farmland. The road continues traveling southwestward, slightly elevated above the farmland. It then travels over a bridge, and soon turns westward, east of the Warren–Issaquena county line.|$|E
50|$|Seen as a spur route {{or access}} road, offset <b>T-intersections</b> {{can be seen}} as a A2 or B2 type partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with no arterial road.|$|R
5000|$|A one-quadrant {{interchange}} uses an overpass and two <b>T-intersections.</b> This is {{the only}} and very common one quadrant variant in Germany, where it is called a [...] "partial at-grade intersection" [...] (Teilplangleicher Verkehrsknoten).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{research}} {{examines the}} effect of restricted head and neck movement on driving performance as measured by decision time at <b>T-intersections.</b> The traffic safety and human factors literature was reviewed, and very little was found concerning drivers with physical limitations. <b>T-intersections</b> were selected for study because most accidents involving drivers with diminished capacities occur at intersections, and <b>T-intersections</b> are simpler than four-way intersections. A laboratory study was selected to provide better experimental control, safety and repeatability. A unique methodology was used that employed a fixed base driving simulator which incorporated the use of video recordings of intersections to provide a 180 degree field of view. Eighteen intersections were studied with various levels of traffic volume and sight distance. The 72 test subjects were {{between the ages of}} 30 - 50, or 60 - 80, and half in each age group had restricted range of movement of their neck. The task for the subjects was to depress the brake pedal, watch the video presentations of the <b>T-intersections</b> on three screens and indicate when it was safe to make a left turn by releasing the brake pedal. The decision time was a measure of driving performance. The study results confirmed the hypotheses that; 1. decision time increases with age, and age effects dominated the other factors which were studied, 2. decision time increases with age and level of impairment indicating that younger drivers are able to compensate for their impairments, but older drivers both with and without impairments are unable to make compensations in their driving performance, 3. traffic volume has a greater impact on decision time at intersections than sight distance, 4. skewed intersections are hazardous for drivers with neck impairments. Further laboratory and field studies are recommended to validate the study results and to examine the problem of skewed intersections...|$|R
5|$|As of 1965, {{the route}} {{was located in}} eastern Wilkinson and western Amite counties. All of the route was a two-laned paved road. MS 572 began {{at the center of}} Centreville, near a {{railroad}} track. The route then traveled down Park Road until it exited Wilkinson County and entered Amite County. After crossing the county line, MS 572 intersected MS 24 and MS 33, and MS 572 was also branded Lower Centreville Road. Continuing eastward, the route exited Centreville and crossed over Beaver Creek and emerged into the village of Olio. MS 572 left Olio, and ended few miles later at MS 569 at a <b>T-intersection.</b> Lower Centreville Road continued east, concurrent with MS 569. MS 572 was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Amite County, as part of the state highway system.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{northwest}} through Wales, NY78 {{remains a}} two-lane rural street known as Strykersville Road until intersecting with US20A (Big Tree Road) at a <b>T-intersection.</b> US 20A and NY 78 become concurrent along Big Tree, proceeding west {{through the town}} of Wales. The routes remain a two-lane residential street for a distance, intersecting with CR383 (Reiter Road) as it winds west. Now {{in the town of}} Aurora, US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY400 (the Aurora Expressway). A short distance later, the routes enter the village of East Aurora. Now known as Main Street, US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two-lane village street, intersecting with NY16 (Olean Road) and the southern continuation of CR6 (Pine Street).|$|E
5|$|East of {{the airport}} {{in the town of}} Massena, NY37 begins to {{parallel}} the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY37C near a hamlet named for the waterway. NY37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown, where NY37 formerly connected to a large traffic circle linking NY37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route45 (CR45). The traffic circle has since been replaced with a <b>T-intersection</b> and traffic light because of the expansion of the American Customs facility. Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east, the road narrows back to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River.|$|E
50|$|Separation of {{pedestrian}} and vehicle traffic - {{which was}} accomplished {{through the creation}} of a network of pedestrian paths providing easy access through parks to area schools and the town centre, while roads were designed to slow vehicular traffic through the use of winding roads, <b>T-intersections,</b> and cul-de-sacs.|$|R
50|$|Some {{countries}} use the priority-to-the-right rule, despite {{driving on}} the left. Australia uses the priority-to-the-right rule at four-way intersections where the roads all have equal priority, but specific rules apply for <b>T-intersections.</b> Singapore also uses priority-to-the-right, as well as priority to vehicles going straight and turning vehicles {{to give way to}} vehicles going straight.|$|R
50|$|Planners {{also began}} to modify the grid into a {{superblock}} system, where high traffic generators such as shops and apartments were placed on arterial roads that formed {{the boundaries of the}} superblock. Schools, churches, and parks were located at the center, and houses filled the residential blocks. Within the superblock, <b>T-intersections,</b> and culs-de-sac acted as traffic calming devices, slowing or preventing through traffic.|$|R
5|$|Route59 {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} with Union County Route610 (CR610; South Avenue) {{in the community}} of Cranford. Route59 heads northwestward, passing a couple of businesses in both directions. The route crosses under the New Jersey Transit-owned Raritan Valley Line at which point the border of Cranford and Garwood runs along the center of the road. The route continues to the northwest, passing businesses before ending at a signalized <b>T-intersection</b> with Route28 (North Avenue). The pavement ends at the intersection though a state-constructed bridge carrying the intersection over a small creek is angled such that a road could continue northwest. Throughout {{the entire length of the}} route, it is four lanes wide (two in each direction). There is no signed speed limit on any portion of the route.|$|E
5|$|SR364 {{starts at}} SR705, on the Darke–Shelby county line. The route goes north in a {{straight}} line, through of Mercer County, and continues onto the Auglaize–Shelby county line. SR364 continues into Auglaize County, where it passes by the St. Joseph Catholic Church, a historic site. The highway intersects SR119 in Minister and SR274 in New Bremen. Later, SR364 intersects SR219, and travels northeast, adjacent to {{the eastern side of}} the Grand Lake. Here, the farmland transitions into forests. The route meets at an <b>T-intersection</b> with SR703. The SR364 and SR703 concurrency travels northwestward, and SR364 splits and heads north, after slightly more than a mile. SR364 crosses a railroad track, and ends at an diamond interchange at SR29. The road continues as County Road15 after this point.|$|E
5|$|At the intersection, Routes957 and958 become {{concurrent}} along a westbound residential street, until leaving Lottsville, {{where the}} two routes turn to the southwest in fields. As Routes 957 and958 approach a railroad line used by Norfolk Southern (and previously the Erie Railroad), Route958 forks to the north, paralleling and soon crossing the rails northwest of Lottsville. The distinctively rural surroundings for Route958 return, and the Norfolk Southern line parallels to the east as the highway curves northwestward. Soon, Route958 returns to a farming region and curves away from the railroad on a mountainside. After passing a large pond, the route intersects Greeley Street a <b>t-intersection</b> in Bear Lake, where Route958 turns eastward through the rural areas before intersecting with North Road, where the route turns northward and reaches the New York state line near Niobe, New York. Route958 terminates here, and the right-of-way continues northward as Chautauqua County Route33 (PanamaBear Lake Road).|$|E
5000|$|Silent {{cops were}} placed in the middle of street intersections at cross roads, and turning drivers were {{expected}} to drive around them when turning right. [...] They were also placed in the centre of the terminating street at <b>T-intersections</b> to force drivers turning in or out of the street to be on the correct side of the road rather than cut the corner.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} report we {{conducted}} research study on driver's behavior in <b>T-Intersections</b> using simulated environment. This report describes and discusses correlation analysis of driver's personality traits and style while driving at <b>T-Intersections.</b> The experiments {{were performed on}} multi user driving simulator under controlled settings, at Linköping University. A total of forty-eight people {{participated in the study}} and were divided into groups of four, all driving in the same simulated world. During the experiments participants were asked to fill a series of well-known self-report questionnaires. We evaluated questionnaires to get the insight in driver's personality traits and driving style. The self-report questionnaires consist of Schwartz's configural model of 10 values types and NEO-five factor inventory. Also driver's behavior was studied with the help of questionnaires based on driver's behavior, style, conflict avoidance, time horizon and tolerance of uncertainty. Then these 10 Schwartz's values are correlated with the other questionnaires to give the detail insight of the driving habits and personality traits of the drivers...|$|R
50|$|Around {{half of that}} {{industrial}} estate is accessible only via one section of Munibung Road, a two-lane road between two <b>T-intersections</b> (Torrens Avenue and Mitchell Road) which experience frequent crashes.

5|$|In 1952, Route 10 was {{designated}} to run along a new, never-built alignment {{farther to the}} north, running through Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair, West Orange, and along the Livingston/Roseland border, roughly along much of the routing of present-day CR 611 (Eagle Rock Avenue), and following its current alignment through Morris County to Ledgewood. A spur of the route was also planned in 1952 to run from Montclair south to Orange. A year later, in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was defined onto its current alignment, with its eastern terminus moved to Prospect Avenue in West Orange. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of the route was replaced with a signalized <b>T-intersection.</b> In the mid-2000s, an $11.5 million project was undertaken to improve safety on the portion of Route 10 in Hanover and East Hanover Townships by widening existing lanes and adding turning lanes to the road.|$|E
5|$|MT 287 {{begins at}} a <b>T-intersection</b> with MT 41 {{in the town}} of Twin Bridges. MT 41 heads west along Fourth Street to cross the Beaverhead River and north along Main Street. MT 287 heads south on Main Street and veers {{southeast}} out of the town. The two-lane highway parallels an inactive Montana Rail Link line through the valley of the Ruby River between the Ruby Range to the southwest and the Tobacco Root Mountains to the northeast. MT 287 follows Main Street through the town of Sheridan, where the route passes the H.D. Rossiter Building, Christ Episcopal Church and Rectory, and the William O'Brien House. The highway passes by the Robbers Roost and to the west of St. Mary of the Assumption Church in the hamlet of Laurin before reaching {{the southern end of the}} rail line in the unincorporated village of Alder, through which the highway follows Main Street and meets the northern end of Upper Ruby Road, which is designated Secondary Highway 357 (S-357).|$|E
5|$|Route 126 {{starts at}} the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a {{straight}} line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage road again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a <b>T-intersection.</b> US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 study {{suggests}} that land use patterns {{play a significant role}} in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern.

25|$|SR634 {{begins at}} an <b>T-intersection</b> in Fort Jennings, SR189 enters from the {{northwest}} and SR190 enters from the southwest. SR190 and SR634 leave the <b>T-intersection</b> concurrent, heading northeast. The road passes through residential properties, as a two-lane highway. Before leaving Fort Jennings, SR634 leaves SR190, heading due north. SR634 heads north, leaving Fort Jennings and entering rural Putnam County. In rural Putnam County the road passes through farmland, as a two-lane highway. The road has an intersection with U.S. Route 224 (US224), in rural Jackson Township. Here, SR634 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2011 ODOT survey, the road is listed with an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 450vehicles on a section of highway that is between US224 and SR114. At Township Road M (T–M), SR634 makes a sharp turn, heading due west. That turn is followed by another sharp turn due north. The highway has a <b>T-intersection</b> with SR114 in Cloverdale. SR634 heads due east, concurrent with SR114, before SR634 turns northwest bound and SR114 continues southeasterly. The road heads northwest, leaving Cloverdale and begins to parallel the Auglaize River.|$|E

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of road crashes occur at intersections: in Victoria, Australia, 15 % of fatal crashes and 25 % of serious injury crashes occur at <b>T-intersections,</b> with similar proportions occurring at cross intersections. Many of these crashes {{can be attributed to}} drivers' inappropriate gap selection. The current study used a driving simulator to examine the influence of both the driver's intended manoeuvre and the gap duration on gap acceptance behaviour at stop-controlled <b>T-intersections.</b> Drivers completed 18 gap acceptance trials, with manoeuvre (turning across traffic, merging with traffic) and gap duration (3 - 11 s) manipulated within-subjects. There was a trend whereby drivers accepted shorter gaps when turning across traffic compared to merging with traffic, which was significant at longer gaps (≥ 9 s) but not at shorter, safety-critical gaps (≤ 8 s). In addition, accepted lag times varied with manoeuvre. When merging with traffic drivers demonstrated longer accepted lag times, suggesting that turn strategies differ depending on traffic direction and intended manoeuvre. Overall the results suggest that the drivers' intended manoeuvre influences gap acceptance, although gap duration remains the most influential factor. Implications of these findings for the development and design of intersection decision support systems are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Since METRO Express buses {{use them}} during rush hour, most routes {{lead to the}} Park and Ride lots and use [...] "secret" [...] HOV lane exits (often {{elevated}} <b>T-intersections)</b> {{that lead to the}} lots (also used by vehicles as well) without having to exit the freeway to street intersections.

50|$|Most {{states in}} the United States enforce priority-to-the-right at {{uncontrolled}} intersections, where motorists must yield to the right, although these intersections are less common. Increasingly, municipalities across the US have introduced all way stops, traffic signals and other designations such as multiple lane right-of-way or paved vs. unpaved roads {{as a means of}} controlling the intersections to decrease the likelihood of a collision and {{to make it easier to}} determine liability in the event of an accident. At <b>T-Intersections,</b> traffic on the terminating road must yield to all traffic at the termination point.|$|R
