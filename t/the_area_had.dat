5|$|A second {{accident}} {{occurred on}} October 11, 2010, in Washington, D.C. While filming a chase scene at 3rd Street and Maryland Avenue, SW, a Metropolitan Police K9 Unit SUV accidentally rammed the Camaro that portrays Bumblebee in the film. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been closed {{off by the}} Washington, D.C., police, and it is unclear why the SUV was there. Both drivers were uninjured, but the Camaro was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major theme}} of East End {{history has been}} that of migration; both inward and outward. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> a strong pull on the rural poor {{from other parts of}} England and {{attracted}} waves of migration from further afield: notably Huguenot refugees, who created a new extramural suburb in Spitalfields in the 17th century., Irish weavers, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the 20th century, Sylheti Bangladeshis.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> a {{long history}} of mineral extraction, with coal, brick clay, gravel and granite amongst the products. All the deep coal mines in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>have</b> closed, but {{opencast}} mining still continues.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{two main}} cores, {{the cities of}} Rotterdam and The Hague. The city of Delft is {{situated}} in between the two major cities. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> a GDP of 170 billion Euros. There are 2700 foreign companies.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been {{inhabited}} {{since the}} Iron Age. The name is known since 1347, then as Kymmelinghe. Until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> was still used as a farm. Since the farm was abandoned, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been kept as a park.|$|R
5|$|German {{forces in}} <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given {{command of the}} newly created Army Group Don, {{comprising}} the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies. Although the situation looked bleak for the Germans, a moment of relative calm had settled {{after the end of}} Operation Uranus; German and Soviet forces were planning their next movements.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Bleuth {{sold the}} lodge to Ezri Namvar. However the casino was in severe decline; by 2009 the revenue was around {{half of that}} which it {{received}} in 1992. Canyon Capital Advisors foreclosed on a $25 million loan, and an auction open across two states failed to result in any bidders. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> seen several other casinos nearby close around the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{intersection}} of Highway 33 and Prince Edward County Road 1 (Scoharie Road) near Picton saw {{the introduction of}} a traffic roundabout, the first ever constructed on a provincial highway in the province, to replace the at-grade intersection. The MTO felt that <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> reached its operational threshold due to high tourist and recreational activity, particularly during the busy summer months, and so felt a traffic roundabout was needed.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been {{a largely}} blue-collar town predominated by small red brick or wooden homes with porches. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{always had a}} large {{presence}} of University of Maryland students, faculty, and staff residents. It also has a large and growing, professional, middle-class African American population.|$|R
50|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been {{primarily}} working class, {{with a large}} immigrant population, mostly Italian-Canadian. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{become an}} attractive location for young professionals and artists, {{as well as an}} influx of immigrants from China and other South-East Asian countries.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> a main {{green space}} of Stockwood Park to enjoy, but also sees the River Lea leave Luton through this area, meaning plenty of {{wildlife}} to enjoy as well. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> good {{links with the}} local manor house, Luton Hoo with the countryside surrounding <b>the</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
5|$|In addition, the Strip {{west of the}} Toledo area is a prime {{location}} for agriculture, because of its well-drained, fertile loam soil. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> for many years produced large amounts of corn and wheat per acre. Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region.|$|E
5|$|In {{the extreme}} south, the six border battalions in the {{province}} of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army; before noon <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered, opening the way for the German feint offensive into Central Belgium. The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1954, the Governor of Singapore, Sir John Fearns Nicoll {{unveiled}} a plaque which declared <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been renamed Kent Ridge {{to commemorate the}} visit by the Duchess of Kent and her son, the Duke of Kent, on 3 October 1952. The plaque was erected at the junction {{of what is now}} Kent Ridge Road and South Buona Vista Road.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> around Qaqortoq <b>has</b> been {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times. Beginning {{with the}} Saqqaq culture roughly 4,300 years ago, <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> had a continuous human presence.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> four {{distinct}} seasons.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{some oil}} deposits.|$|R
5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean attacks in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> {{long been}} {{the site of the}} Kiwanis Playing Field, and was not {{disturbed}} until Imperial Oil bought the property in 1938. At this time, the below-ground remains of the structures were likely removed. Excavations revealed the remains of a privy, which contained more than 5,000 artifacts of domestic and personal items from the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{substantial}} bischofite deposits.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{played host to}} {{numerous}} waves of migration to Leicester and subsequent generations, notably including Indian, Jewish, Irish, Polish, Somali, Pakistani, and Caribbean populations, who have contributed significantly to <b>the</b> <b>area's</b> character and rich cultural diversity. Recently <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> seen a large growth in immigrants from Eastern Europe.|$|R
50|$|Extensive archaeological {{exploration}} of <b>the</b> park <b>area</b> <b>has</b> indicated that <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been inhabited by humans {{for thousands of}} years. The earliest known are predecessors of the modern-day Inuit.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, {{can be traced}} to the {{founding}} of a trading post by E.T. Barnette on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} era of Minnesota {{lasted from}} the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 to Minnesota's achieving statehood in 1858. The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in 1849 but <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> a rich history well before this. Though {{there was a}} long history of European presence in the area before 19th century, it was during the 19th century that the United States began to establish a firm presence in what would become Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 Census the Chew Valley North Ward (which {{includes}} Chew Magna and Chew Stoke), had 2,307 residents, {{living in}} 911 households, {{with an average}} age of 42.3 years. Of these, 77% of residents described their health as 'good'; 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> an unemployment rate of 1.3% of all economically active people aged 16â€“74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> also <b>has</b> a {{significant}} Koala population, {{which has been}} able to survive {{because of the lack of}} development.In recent years, the median house price of <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> skyrocketed because of the exclusiveness that <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> to offer. Because there is only a limited number of houses allowed in Merricks Beach, any properties on the market are highly sought - no matter their age or size.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> {{a popular}} {{community}} centre.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> a warm-summer Mediterranean climate.|$|R
5|$|As {{there were}} no local stakes in Canada at the time, Monson was {{responsible}} for both the missionaries and all LDS Church operations in the area. When he became mission president, he oversaw 130 missionaries and 55 church branches divided into 9 districts. During his tenure, the number of missionaries peaked at 180. Historically, most districts and branches in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been presided over by full-time missionaries, but Monson placed local members as presidents of branches and districts soon after arriving.|$|E
5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an {{enormous}} volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>had</b> been residentialâ€”Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the churchâ€”but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been depopulating since 1900.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>has</b> been mined for uranium.|$|R
