5|$|Before his {{appointment}} {{to lead the}} Discovery Expedition, Scott had followed the career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, {{he had a chance}} encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Paris {{was finally}} recaptured by Charles VII of France in 1436. When the French king re-entered the city, his enemies in Paris {{fortified}} {{themselves in the}} Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were allowed {{to leave the city}} after the payment of a ransom. The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once <b>taken,</b> <b>this</b> allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.|$|E

5|$|Smith was {{instrumental}} in the inauguration of the air mail service by the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the summer of 1919. He had logged 900 hours of flying time in the Army before he joined the U.S. Mail Service at age nineteen. His first assignment was to fly mail from Omaha, Nebraska, to California, essentially following the same route as the Oregon Trail. His mother had <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> trail by covered wagon from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Cove, Oregon, in 1871. His mother and grandparents had taken two years to complete their trip, whereas Smith flew his route to California within a week with several stops along the way.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} Persian navy began its maneuvers, Aristides {{arrived at the}} Allied camp from Aegina. Aristides had been {{recalled}} from exile {{along with the other}} ostracised Athenians on the order of Themistocles, so that Athens might be united against the Persians. Aristides told Themistocles that the Persian fleet had encircled the Allies, which greatly pleased Themistocles, as he now knew that the Persians had walked into his trap. The Allied commanders seem to have <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> news rather uncomplainingly, and Holland therefore suggests that they were party to Themistocles's ruse all along. Either way, the Allies prepared for battle, and Themistocles delivered a speech to the marines before they embarked on the ships. In the ensuing battle, the cramped conditions in the Straits hindered the much larger Persian navy, which became disarrayed, and the Allies took advantage to win a famous victory.|$|E
5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E

5|$|Just to {{the south}} of the castle is the {{restored}} 18th-century castle watermill. In 2010 the castle received 128,242 visitors. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, itself an important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises more environmentally friendly. This {{was the first time the}} National Trust have <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714kg (3,778lb) of carbon a year. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region or ethnicity, were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had <b>taken</b> <b>this</b> music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E
5|$|With the Germans mostly {{unable to}} operate and advance {{without the support}} of the {{experienced}} Finnish units, their hope now lay on a continuation of the attack led by the Finns themselves. These hopes were soon squashed. Field Marshal Carl Mannerheim, supreme commander of the Finnish forces, insisted on delaying further offensive operations, citing military and logistical reasons. On 17 November, Siilasvuo ordered an immediate stop to the Finnish III Corps' offensive, despite positive feedback from his field commanders that further ground could be <b>taken.</b> <b>This</b> sudden change in Finnish behaviour was, in some part, the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States and Britain. Finland was no longer interested in spearheading such an offensive. With the Finnish refusal to be involved in further offensive operations, Arctic Fox came to an end in November and both sides dug in.|$|E

5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time <b>taken.</b> <b>This</b> moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and moving up to fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took back a little time against some of the other riders in the field in stages 17 and 20, to improve his final position to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E
