Low voltage synchrophasors are collected by platform called WAMSTER, including handheld Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and GPRS data <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dedicated <b>served.</b> Measurements are available on-line. CARWAMS uses previously developed Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) with added pseudo real time monitoring applications such as angle and frequency instability. Archived measurements and calculated results are used for post mortem analysis and further development of applications...|$|R

He was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> aide-de-camp <b>to</b> General Sumner, and ended up marrying Sumner's daughter, Mary Heron Sumner, in 1860. They had their first child, Virginia Tunstall, on March 5, 1861.|$|R

On 4 June 1815, Broughton was made a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath and promoted to Colonel of the Marines on 12 March 1819.|$|R
50|$|Admiral Mastagni's first active flight {{assignment}} was with Patrol Squadron 22 (VP-22), stationed at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii. Through this tour, Admiral Mastagni <b>served</b> as <b>a</b> P-3B pilot and was {{designated as a}} Patrol Plane Mission Commander on September 22, 1976. In 1977, then Lieutenant Mastagni was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> tour of duty at the United States Air Force Academy as a Navy liaison instructor. He was released from active duty in June 1979 with seven years of active service.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{from the}} south (LGV Sud-Est or LGV Atlantique), the line begins at Coubert {{junction}} and heads northeast. Near Tournan, there is <b>a</b> link <b>to</b> the Paris-Coulommiers line. Further north, Marne-la-Vallée - Chessy station (<b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> the RER <b>A)</b> <b>serves</b> the new town of Marne-la-Vallée and Disneyland Paris theme parks. Near Claye-Souilly, two links under construction will join the line to the LGV Est. The route next serves Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV station (<b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> the RER B and air transport). Shortly thereafter, the line joins the LGV Nord at Vémars junction.|$|R

In January 2005 Liu Zhixiang was arrested for embezzlement, bribe-taking, and arranging {{the killing of a}} contractor intent on exposing him. Before being arrested, Liu Zhixiang was able <b>to</b> amass <b>a</b> fortune equivalent <b>to</b> fifty million dollars (US) in cash, real estate, jewelry, and art. He was sentenced to death, but this sentence was suspended and reduced to sixteen years in jail, after which he was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hospital <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> his sentence there. While serving his sentence in hospital he reportedly continued to conduct rail business by phone.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{computer}} aided method supporting co-operation between different project partners, such as architects and engineers, {{on the basis of}} strictly three-dimensional models. The center of our software architecture is a product model, described by the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) of the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). From this a geometrical model is extracted and automatically <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> computational model <b>serving</b> as <b>a</b> basis for various simulation tasks. In this paper the focus is set on the advantage of the fully three-dimensional structural analysis performed by p-version of the finite element analysis. Other simulation methods are discussed in a separate contribution of this Volume (Treeck 2004). The validity of this approach will be shown in a complex example...|$|R
40|$|A feeder-trunk scheme {{has been}} labeled as {{superior}} {{in urban areas}} due {{to the presence of}} economies of density (decreasing average operating cost) along the avenues served by trunk lines. We compare this structure against three types of direct lines structures (no <b>transfers)</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> stylized public transport network where several flows converge into a main avenue, simultaneously optimizing fleet and vehicle sizes considering both users' and operators' costs. The best structure is shown to depend not only on the total passenger volume but also on demand imbalance, demand dispersion in the origins and the length of the trunk line. The region where the feeder-trunk structure dominates depends largely on the value assigned <b>to</b> the pure <b>transfer</b> penalty. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Transfer (i. e., the {{application}} of a learned skill in a novel context) is an important and desirable outcome of motor skill learning. While much research has been devoted <b>to</b> understanding <b>transfer</b> of explicit skills the mechanisms of skill transfer after incidental learning remain poorly understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} 1) examine the effect of practice schedule on transfer and 2) investigate whether sequence-specific knowledge can <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar sequence context. We trained two groups of participants on an implicit serial response time task under a Constant (one sequence for 10 blocks) or Variable (alternating between two sequences for a total of 10 blocks) practice schedule. We evaluated response times for three types of transfer: task-general <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> structurally non-overlapping sequence, inter-manual <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perceptually identical sequence, and sequence-specific <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> partially overlapping (3 shared triplets) sequence. Results showed partial skill <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> all three sequences and an advantage of Variable practice only for task-general transfer. Further, we found expression of sequence-specific knowledge for familiar sub-sequences in the overlapping sequence. These findings suggest that 1) constant practice may create interference for task-general transfer and 2) sequence-specific knowledge can <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new sequential context...|$|R
