The models include commuting and non-commuting transports, and they allow for telecommuting. We implement the models numerically using Belgian data. Results include the following. First, if union preferences reflect the transport concerns of their members, we find that optimal congestion taxes under competitive labor market conditions exceed those under bargaining by 10 - 17 %. Second, the combination of substantially higher <b>transport</b> <b>taxes</b> and lower labor taxes compared to the reference situation jointly implies that the optimal tax structure strongly stimulates telecommuting for both labor market structures considered.

The question of land reform was an essential point of Cuza's political programme, and he and Kogălniceanu had wider aims: the abolition of compulsory labour and the establishment of private small holdings. Conservative landowners expressed opposition in Parliament, leading to a bitter political struggle culminating in its dissolution in the coup of 2 May 1864. The draft law was written by the Council of State, amended by the Government and promulgated by the prince on 14/26 August 1864. His proclamation announced to the peasants: [...] "The corvée is forever abolished and you are henceforth free proprietors in the places subjected to your control".

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study optimal {{congestion}} tolls in a bargaining model of the labour market. The model distinguishes commuting and non-commuting transport, and it allows some telecommuting. We first show that transport taxes as well as congestion levels raise negotiated wages and reduce employment levels; more efficient homework reduces wages. We then study optimal second-best labour and <b>transport</b> <b>tax</b> policies and find that they strongly depend on the impact of congestion on labour market outcomes. If transport taxes have to be uniform for commuting and other trip purposes, the optimal peak period <b>transport</b> <b>tax</b> positively depends on the impact of congestion on negotiated wages, and negatively on the wage effects of the congestion tax itself. Moreover, the tax rises to the extent that demand by people that are not active on the labour market represent a larger fraction of peak period transport flows. We further show that more efficient homework does not necessarily reduce congestion nor the optimal <b>transport</b> <b>tax.</b> If taxes can be differentiated according to trip purpose, subsidizing commuting is justified as a way to shift the tax burden away from the employed. Finally, extending the model for multiple transport modes we find that the impact of congestion on negotiated wages provides an argument for subsidizing commuting by public transport but not by car, a proposal suggested in several European countries...|$|E

Although differentiation of general <b>transport</b> <b>taxes</b> on the basis of environmental performance is quite widely used to leverage vehicle purchase decisions, this paper is concerned with the larger and more fundamental potential for influencing patterns of demand for road transport offered by the introduction of road pricing, in the form of electronic kilometre charges and area wide road pricing systems. Finance and Transport Ministers are considering the introduction of such charges, and/or the wider use of road tolls, in a number of OECD countries. Each government considering reform faces urgent pressures [...] altering taxation is always politically sensitive and not something undertaken lightly. The main motivations are:- Raising additional revenue for investment in transport infrastructure;- Ensuring foreign trucks contribute adequately to the costs of using roads;- Managing chronic congestion;- Improving the natural or urban environment; More generally, the introduction of electronic kilometre charges for trucks, and possibly for cars, is being considered in some countries as a means to reducing inefficiencies and distortions in <b>transport</b> <b>taxes</b> and charges, aiming at:- Substituting for fixed charges for owning or using trucks in order to move towards international harmonisation of the fixed charges, as differences in the level of these taxes tend to distort international competition, leading to complaints from national haulage associations to their governments (even if the complaints often misguidedly target fuel tax differences);- Providing for more predictable relationships between road and rail costs, by substituting for fuel taxes which tend to be somewhat volatile due to oil price instability and political pressure...|$|R

40|$|Taxation of road {{transport}} {{has traditionally been}} used as a means of raising revenue to finance public road infrastructure. However, over the last 20 years there has been a gradual shift towards using taxation as an incentive on road users to modify their behaviour and redress the externalities of road traffic. In Australia as in many developed countries, the increasing traffic volume is generating externalities in the form of environmental costs and social costs borne by society. Studies conducted overseas and in Australia indicate that these costs are significant and are likely to grow in the near future. This paper analyses the various externalities associated with {{road transport}} and discusses the role of various forms of taxation in addressing these externalities. The paper finds that the current Australian road <b>transport</b> <b>tax</b> policies will not help to challenge the problems posed by an increasing road transport demand. Recommendations and proposed reforms for the Australian road <b>transport</b> <b>tax</b> regime are examined in the context of two examples of reform implementation in the UK and Singapore.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{an overview of}} changes in transport taxation in European countries to promote more sustainable transport. A number {{of changes in the}} framework of car taxation have resulted in some useful environmental gains. However, these changes are limited because the <b>transport</b> <b>tax</b> system has been designed to produce a substantial income from internal-combustion-engine vehicles in an easily administered form. A major restructuring of transport taxation is required to fully address a different goal – that of stimulating improvements to environmental performance. A generalised road user charging-based system could be the way forward. Such a system is now seen by several European countries and some USA states as the transport taxation regime for the 21 st century. Tax regime change is emerging onto the transport policy agenda as a vital long-term strategy. Largely by default, transport policy-makers are coming to realise that road taxation regime change is inevitable if traffic and congestion management is to be a reality. The way we taxed vehicles and fuel in the 20 th century is simply not appropriate for the transport challenges we face today. ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the history, the {{transportation}} of goods and related logistics have {{played an important role}} in human development and existence. This pertains to numerous interlinked processes, whose management is often linked to social system, international linkages, development of industry, market and market specifics.

The present Slovenian economy depends to a large extent on economies and corporate relations of the European Union and the world. Such inter-connectedness demands frequent transportation of semi-finished and finished goods. By providing timely delivery of goods, transportation consequently enables inter-organizational linkages and individual production, economic, market and other processes. Organizational and inter-organizational management of transport logistics demands profound understanding of transport flows, freight forwarding expertise and knowledge of <b>transport,</b> <b>tax,</b> environmental and other related regulations.

40|$|Road {{transport}} and aviation are, or are becoming, {{major sources of}} carbon emissions which {{will need to be}} reduced if the UK’s carbon dioxide (CO 2) reduction targets are to be met. However, since 1980 the real costs of motoring have fallen while those of other transport modes have risen, and rising incomes have also increased transport demand, offsetting efficiency increases. Increased road transport taxation, which could be introduced as part of a green fiscal reform, will be essential if demand is to be managed and carbon emissions from road <b>transport</b> reduced. <b>Taxes</b> on vehicle purchase, ownership and use have different effects, and can be used to pursue different policy goals. For example, taxes on purchase and ownership can incentivise manufacturers to develop low carbon vehicles and people to buy them. Tax measures on vehicle use are needed to reduce congestion and overall energy use. This briefing discusses experience with road <b>transport</b> and aviation <b>taxes</b> in the UK and other European countries, and considers how they might develop to take account of increasingly stringent CO 2 reduction targets and other issues such as the increasing diversity of road fuels, and the need to maintain government income. In particular, any shift to electric vehicles may require a parallel shift to road user charging if revenues from <b>transport</b> <b>taxes,</b> and incentives to reduce the damaging effects of road transport apart from emissions, are to be maintained. Each tax introduced will affect some people more than others. Increasing fuel duty is progressive overall because most low-income households do not have a car, but there are concerns about the impact on low income motorists, particularly in rural areas, which can be at least partially addressed if the revenues are recycled in a progressive manner. Increasing taxation on air travel is even more progressive because most leisure flying is by the wealthiest 20 per cent of the population and those on low incomes fly very little...|$|R
