6000|$|The {{magazine}} writer discussed {{theories of}} government; these men the practice. They had been there. They {{knew all about}} it. They banged <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the table and spoke of political [...] "pulls," [...] the vending of votes, and so forth. Theirs was not the talk of village babblers reconstructing {{the affairs of the}} nation, but of strong, coarse, lustful men fighting for spoil, and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it.|$|R
50|$|Çelebi-Gottschlich {{migrated}} to Berlin from Turkey in 1970 {{at the age}} of 17. In 1987 she would cause a minor sensation when she became the first individual of Turkish origin to enter any West German Parliament when she joined the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin on the ticket of the Alternative Liste (AL). When she began a parliamentary speech in Turkish in April 1987, members of the Christian Democratic Union drowned her out by pounding <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the table and she was forced to stop speaking.|$|R

The motion resembles someone climbing a ladder.|$|R
60|$|At first Smoke and Shorty shoved {{and thrust}} and threw back. Then {{they used the}} butt of the dog-whip and <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the food-mad crowd. And all this against a {{background}} of moaning and wailing women and children. Here and there, in a dozen places, the sled-lashings were cut. Men crawled in on their bellies, regardless of a rain of kicks and blows, and tried to drag out the grub. These had to be picked up bodily and flung back. And such was their weakness that they fell continually, under the slightest pressures or shoves. Yet they made no attempt to injure the two men who defended the sled.|$|R

50|$|In Week 1, eleven NFL players joined Kaepernick's protests. Denver Broncos player Brandon Marshall took a knee {{during the}} {{national}} anthem {{prior to the start}} of the Kickoff game, which was broadcast on NBC. Kaepernick and Marshall were teammates at the University of Nevada. On September 11, Kansas City Chiefs player Marcus Peters raised his fist while the rest of the team interlocked their arms showing solidarity. Two members of the New England Patriots, Devin McCourty and Martellus Bennett, raised <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> Sunday Night Football. The entire Seattle Seahawks team stood and interlocked arms. At the same time, a group of Jacksonville Jaguars players, led by cornerback Prince Amukamara, initially planned to join the protest but chose not to do so after photographs of Kaepernick wearing socks with a crude anti-police message during training camp were made public.|$|R
5000|$|... "Nobby" [...] {{was clearly}} {{contentious}} {{and maybe a}} bit proud. After he built, or over built, his mansion in the Gilded Age, he and his upslope neighbor, Behrend Joost, began a feud that lasted their lifetime. While the frequently given reason for the daily warfare was the Mountain Spring Water Company service Joost owned and provided to Clarke and others in Eureka Valley, it is probable these two [...] "rags to riches" [...] businessmen were destined to compete about anything and everything. By then it was their nature to achieve by outdoing everyone else. Their stormy relationship didn't stop with sharp words; neighbors still recount stories of <b>their</b> <b>fist</b> fights <b>on</b> 18th Street.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the room}} in which the owner dined--traditionally called the great parlour--and within it sat about a dozen young men of the yeomanry cavalry, one of them being Festus. They were drinking, laughing, singing, thumping <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the tables, and enjoying {{themselves}} in the very perfection of confusion. The candles, blown by the breeze from the partly opened window, had guttered into coffin handles and shrouds, and, choked by their long black wicks for want of snuffing, gave out a smoky yellow light. One {{of the young men}} might possibly have been in a maudlin state, for he had his arm round the neck of his next neighbour. Another was making an incoherent speech to which nobody was listening. Some of their faces were red, some were sallow; some were sleepy, some wide awake. The only one among them who appeared in his usual frame of mind was Festus, whose huge, burly form rose {{at the head of the}} table, enjoying with a serene and triumphant aspect the difference between his own condition and that of his neighbours. While the trumpet-major looked, a young woman, niece of Anthony Cripplestraw, and one of Uncle Benjy's servants, was called in by one of the crew, and much against her will a fiddle was placed in her hands, from which they made her produce discordant screeches.|$|R
40|$|I {{have found}} through sociological {{research}} and observation that body language defines how people perceive us. The {{importance of the}} first handshake, the manner we bring our hands together while talking, or the way students use <b>their</b> <b>fist</b> to rest <b>on</b> <b>their</b> chin while in class [...] all these mannerisms explain to the potential employer, the vivid listener, or the professor how we feel without consciously knowing it. The purpose of my work is to expand awareness to professionals towards implications of their presented body language...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what it is, Atkins, your men are {{carrying}} it on too far. Bill here, and I, were good friends with the natives; the chief gave us wives, and we got on well enough with them. What with the cocoanuts, which are free to us all, and the patches of ground to cultivate, we had all we wanted, and with the store of beads and bright cotton we brought here with us we paid the natives to fish for pearls for us, and have collected enough copra to trade for rum and whatever else we want. You have got all our copra on board, and a good stock of native trumperies, and I should recommend you to be off, both for your own sake and ours. Your men have been more or less drunk ever since they came here. I don't mind a drinking bout myself now and again, but it does not do to keep it up. However, it would be no odds to us whether your men were drunk all the time or not if they would but get drunk on board, but they will bring the liquor on shore, and then they get quarrelsome, use <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the natives, and meddle with the women. Now, these fellows are quiet and gentle enough if they are left alone and treated fairly, but I don't blame them for getting riled up when they are ill-treated, and I tell you they are riled up pretty badly now. My woman has spoken to me more than once, and from what she says there is likely to be trouble, not only for you but for us." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{second point}} being evidently the {{practical}} one, I had better give my reason. Exhibition pugilism {{is essentially a}} branch of Art: that is to say, it acts and attracts by propagating feeling. The feeling it propagates is pugnacity. Sense of danger, dread of danger, impulse to batter and destroy what threatens and opposes, triumphant delight in succeeding: this is pugnacity, the great adversary of the social impulse to live and let live; to establish our rights by shouldering our share of the social burden; to face and examine danger instead of striking at it; to understand everything {{to the point of}} pardoning (and righting) everything; to conclude an amnesty with Nature wide enough to include even those we know the worst of: namely, ourselves. If two men quarrelled, and asked the Borough Council to lend them a room to fight it out in with <b>their</b> <b>fists,</b> <b>on</b> the ground that a few minutes' hearty punching of one another's heads would work off their bad blood and leave them better friends, each desiring, not victory, but satisfaction, I am not sure that I should not vote for compliance. But if a syndicate of showmen came and said, Here we have two men who have no quarrel, but who will, if you pay them, fight before your constituency and thereby make a great propaganda of pugnacity in it, sharing the profits with us and with you, I should indignantly oppose the proposition. And if the majority were against me, I should try to persuade them to at least impose the condition that the fight should be with naked fists under the old rules, so that the combatants should, like Sayers and Langham, depend on bunging up each other's eyes rather than, like the modern knocker-out, giving one another concussion of the brain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly, my dear; {{because the}} sitters are always either {{the one or}} the other,' replied Miss La Creevy. 'Look at the Royal Academy! All those {{beautiful}} shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats, with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> doubled up <b>on</b> round tables, or marble slabs, are serious, you know; and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols, or little dogs, or little children--it's the same rule in art, only varying the objects--are smirking. In fact,' said Miss La Creevy, sinking her voice to a confidential whisper, 'there are only two styles of portrait painting; the serious and the smirk; and we always use the serious for professional people (except actors sometimes), and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who don't {{care so much about}} looking clever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} {{watching}} machinery in repose after reading about machinery in action. An excellent gentleman who bears a name honoured in the magazines writes, much as Disraeli orated, of [...] "the sublime instincts of an ancient people," [...] the certainty with which they can be trusted to manage their own affairs in their own way, and {{the speed with which}} they are making for all sorts of desirable goals. This he called a statement or purview of American politics. I went almost directly afterwards to a saloon where gentlemen interested in ward politics nightly congregate. They were not pretty persons. Some of them were bloated, and they all swore cheerfully till the heavy gold watch-chains on their fat stomachs rose and fell again; but they talked over their liquor as men who had power and unquestioned access to places of trust and profit. The magazine-writer discussed theories of government; these men the practice. They had been there. They knew all about it. They banged <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> the table and spoke of political [...] "pulls," [...] the vending of votes, and so forth. Theirs was not the talk of village babblers reconstructing the affairs of the nation, but of strong, coarse, lustful men fighting for spoil and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it. I listened long and intently to speech I could not understand, or only in spots. It was the speech of business, however. I had sense enough to know that, and to do my laughing outside the door. Then I began to understand why my pleasant and well-educated hosts in San Francisco spoke with a bitter scorn of such duties of citizenship as voting and taking an interest in the distribution of offices. Scores of men have told me with no false pride that they would as soon concern themselves with the public affairs of the city or State as rake muck. Read about politics as the cultured writer of the magazines regards 'em, and then, and not till then, pay your respects to the gentlemen who run the grimy reality.|$|R
