As the gang prepare to make one last raid – their target being a £20,000 haul of nickel ingots – Ross himself joins the operation {{with the aim of}} exposing Miles. Having uncovered the truth behind Ross's actions, Diamond pulls a gun on the officer and chases him through the cellars underneath the café. Wounding Ross with one of his bullets, Diamond eventually corners him, only to be shot dead by Johnny – an undercover detective who has successfully infiltrated the gang.

Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, two {{suspects}} in the murder investigation were questioned and forced to provide statements in New York to investigating Gardaí and American authorities. Senior detectives from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation travelled to the United States in late 2013, and in December they - accompanied by US law enforcement - brought {{two suspects}} in for questioning from a property in New York. Both suspects refused to answer questions, however under US law they were compelled to provide written witness statements about the incident before being released without charge. The suspects were Irish males in their early 20s, and had fled to the US following the murder of Donohoe. <b>The</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>are</b> said to be liaising about extraditing the suspects back to Ireland, but must wait until the Director of Public Prosecutions rules that charges will be brought.

500|$|Mount Charles Stewart {{is located}} in the Bow Valley just north of Canmore. [...] The peak was named for him in 1928.

There was a Mount Stewart already when it was determined, in 1928, that Mr. Stewart should be honoured. <b>The</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>are</b> reluctant to apply the same name to more than one mountain and perhaps appropriate political connections were made use of to [...] "bend the rules" [...] somewhat and allow Charles Stewart to have his mountain.|$|E
500|$|On 7 November 2013, {{a person}} who was at the murder scene {{uploaded}} a 1:04 minute video on YouTube showing the scene before Francisco Rafael was killed. The video starts with the former vocalist of Banda El Recodo singing [...] "El Señor de las Canas", a song by Vicente Fernández, alongside a mariachi group. As the film progresses, the camera turns to the sides and shows former footballer Jared Borgetti sitting at a table with Rocío del Carmen Lizárraga, wife of Francisco Rafael. Towards the last seconds of the video, a bald-looking man passes through the back of the tables {{in front of the camera}} and apparently gives a hand signal to the assassin before walking away. Then, a man dressed as a clown (the presumed assassin) passes through the crowd and heads towards Francisco Rafael. Seconds later, one shot was heard; most of the invitees were not aware of what had happened, and the music continued. Shortly afterwards, four more shots were heard from the rear. Following the second round of shots, the music stopped and the invitees started screaming. The video only captured a few seconds after the last four shots before concluding. The Baja California Sur authorities believe that the bald-looking man that appeared on the video shortly before the clown and apparently gave him a hand signal is involved in the murder plot. Eyewitnesses who sat at a table with the suspect stated that they did not know who he was but that they saw him greet Francisco Rafael during the party. The suspect reportedly made three phone calls during the party and sent several text messages. Investigators believe that the man was possibly communicating with the assassin; <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>are</b> investigating the text messages and phone calls made that day in the area through the Telcel database. With the surface of the video, the authorities were able to also gather more information about the assassin and the murder. They were able to identify other invitees, including former Cruz Azul footballer Héctor López. The video allowed the authorities to identify the physical characteristics of the assassin, including his skin color, approximate height, and the color of his clothing. <b>The</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>are</b> investigating whether any purchases made in custom or fabric stores in the area might lead them to the murderers.|$|E

500|$|The motives {{behind the}} murder case are officially unknown but Mexican {{authorities}} believe {{that given the}} circumstances and the players involved, the suspected source of fire was organized crime and that the motives possibly stemmed from [...] "unpaid old debts, and old retributions". <b>The</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>are</b> working with two separate lines of investigation: (1) the first line alleges that Francisco Rafael was killed {{by members of the}} Beltrán Leyva Cartel, a drug trafficking organization that fights for the control of the smuggling routes in the Baja California peninsula against the Sinaloa Cartel; (2) the second line alleges that Francisco Rafael was killed by members of the Sinaloa Cartel, specifically on orders of [...] "El Chapo" [...] Guzmán, the cartel's leader. [...] "El Chapo" [...] was nearly captured by the Mexican federal police in Los Cabos in March 2012, after an anonymous call informed the DEA that the drug lord was possibility hiding in three properties. Investigators allege that Francisco Rafael, although he was no longer involved in organized crime, might have tipped the authorities to his whereabouts and incurred [...] "El Chapo's" [...] wrath. They also believe that the attack might have been carried out by a local drug-dealing group in Los Cabos; the main suspect of this allegation is a man named Javier López Rivera or Javier Acosta López (alias [...] "El Javier" [...] and/or [...] "El Javi"), the supposed leader of this crime cell. In this line of investigation, the authorities believe that the drug dealer sent two of his men to pick up the assassin who had arrived from Sinaloa at the Los Cabos International Airport. Two of the three men involved in the murder case, they allege, go by the aliases [...] "Caín" [...] and [...] "El Chapito".|$|E
