Fritz appeared in the early 1960s Animal Town strips drawn by Charles and Robert Crumb. Sometimes Fritz was accompanied by Fuzzy the Bunny, who served as an alter ego for Charles, his creator.|$|E

Some, including Rod Scribner, Dick Lundy, Virgil Walter Ross, Norman McCabe and John Sparey, welcomed Bakshi {{and felt that}} Fritz the Cat would bring diversity to the animation industry. Other animators were less pleased by Bakshi's arrival and placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter, stating that his [...] "filth" [...] was unwelcome in California. By the time production wrapped, Cinemation had released Melvin Van Peebles' Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song to considerable success, despite the X rating it had received. When the Motion Picture Association of America gave Bakshi's film an X rating as well, Cinemation exploited it for promotional purposes, advertising Fritz the Cat as [...] "90 minutes of violence, excitement, and SEX... he's X-rated and animated!" [...] Variety called it an [...] "amusing, diverting, handsomely executed poke at youthful attitudes". John Grant writes in his book Masters of Animation that Fritz <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the breakthrough movie that opened brand new vistas to the commercial animator in the United States", presenting an [...] "almost disturbingly accurate" [...] portrayal [...] "of a particular stratum of Western society during a particular era, [...] as such it has dated very well." [...] Fritz <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> released on April 12, 1972, opening in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. A major hit, it became the most successful independent animated feature of all time.

[...] Released on 12 April 1972, it opened simultaneously in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. The film {{went on to become}} a worldwide hit, grossing over $100 million (USD) and was the most successful independent animated feature ever. The film is credited with extending Crumb's reputation beyond the underground comix scene. Crumb disliked how the film presented the sexual content and politics, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic". Following the film's release, The People's Comics published the story [...] "Fritz the Cat 'Superstar'", in which Crumb satirized Bakshi and Krantz. Crumb portrayed Fritz in a script conference for a fictional sequel Fritz Goes to India. The strip ends with a neurotic ex-girlfriend killing Fritz. She stabs him in the back of the head with an ice pick due to Fritz's overt sexism.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the compilations Head Comix and R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat, Crumb received increased attention and Fritz the Cat {{became one of the most}} familiar features on the underground comix scene and Crumb's most famous creation. These stories served as the basis for a pair of film adaptations produced by Steve Krantz, Fritz the Cat 1972, directed by Ralph Bakshi, and The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat 1974, directed by Robert Taylor. According to Dez Skinn, author of Comix: The Underground Revolution, the strip served as an inspiration for Omaha the Cat Dancer. In Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics, D. Aviva Rothschild criticized the stories printed in the collection The Life & Death of Fritz the Cat as being misogynist, racist, and violent. He felt that, [...] "They also tend to ramble, as if Crumb were making them up as he went along." [...] Rothschild concluded that, [...] "Even though Fritz the Cat is a classic, there are better, more coherent Crumb books around." [...] The 1972 film adaptation of Fritz <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> ranked 51st on the Online Film Critics Society's list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time and 56th on Channel 4's list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons.|$|E

[...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named [...] "Matilda."

[...] Visitors can spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E
