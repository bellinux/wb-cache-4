5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the amber-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the chemical causing bluing upon <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> was reported in 1973. The molecule, gyrocyanin, is a highly oxidized bis-phenol-substituted cyclopentenone that develops a blue color when it is oxidized. In contrast, the bluing of other boletes {{has been attributed to}} the oxidation of variegatic or xerocomic acid. Gyrocyanin is biosynthesized from intermediates supplied by the shikimate pathway, a metabolic route used by fungi for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

40|$|Maintenance of the {{sporting}} activity of elite athletes in adapted sports {{can be difficult}} if a secondary disorder, such as a pressure ulcer, occurs. Pressure ulcers result from deep <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries</b> by external pressure. The {{purpose of this study}} was to use ultrasonography to investigate deep <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries</b> in male wheelchair basketball players of a Japanese national team, and to determine factors associated with the injuries (e. g., body mass index, class of wheelchair basketball, underlying disease, length of athletic career, and whether use of wheelchair is primarily for playing basketball). Twenty male Japanese wheelchair basketball players on the national team for the 2012 London Paralympic Games (12 representative players and eight candidate representative players) participated in this study. The sacral region and bilateral ischial regions in each athlete were examined by ultrasonography to detect low-echoic lesions indicative of deep <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries.</b> Nine (45 %) players had low-echoic lesions, which were detected in 10 of 60 areas. Eight lesions were detected in the sacral region and two lesions were detected in the ischial region. More players with spinal cord injury had low-echoic lesions [9 (69. 2 %) of 13 players], compared to players with skeletal system disease [0 (0 %) of 7 players, p =  0. 002]. Players who used a wheelchair in daily life were more likely to have low-echoic lesions [8 (66. 74 %) of 12 players], compared to players who primarily used a wheelchair for playing basketball [1 (12. 5 %) of 8 players, p =  0. 010]. Deep <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries</b> were detected in 45 % of male Japanese wheelchair basketball players on the national team. Players with spinal cord injury and players who used a wheelchair in daily life were more likely to have deep <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries,</b> particularly in the sacral region.
