5|$|Ryan {{supports}} eliminating <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> {{the corporate}} income tax, the estate tax, and the Alternative Minimum Tax. In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During {{the economic recovery}} from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax.</b> His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E

Saverin became a U.S. citizen in 1998 and renounced his U.S. {{citizenship}} in 2011 because of his [...] "interest in working and living in Singapore"; he also reduced <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> he would have paid after the Facebook IPO. The Wall Street Journal estimated the tax savings at over $700 million.|$|R
25|$|During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's {{editorial}} page was particularly influential {{as the leading}} voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a federal}} wealth tax is {{prohibited}} by the United States Constitution unless the receipts are {{distributed to the}} States by their populations, {{state and local government}} property tax amount to a wealth tax on real estate, and because capital gains are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted profits, <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.|$|E
25|$|Coleman had a {{consistent}} record of voting for broad tax reform. Coleman supported reductions to <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> the marriage penalty, {{and supported the}} doubling of the child tax credit. Coleman also supported elimination of the AMT and death tax. Coleman supported efforts to make permanent the tax code enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.|$|E

50|$|Under the Moldovan <b>Tax</b> Code a <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} between the acquisition and the disposition price of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> asset. Only this difference (i.e. the gain) is taxable. The applicable rate is half (1/2) of the income tax rate, which for individuals is 18% and for companies was 15% (but in 2008 is 0%). Therefore, in 2008 <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> <b>tax</b> rate is 9% for individuals and 0% for companies.|$|R
50|$|There is a 6% <b>Capital</b> <b>Gains</b> <b>Tax</b> and a 1.5% Documentary Stamps on the {{disposal}} of real estate in the Philippines. While <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Gain</b> <b>Tax</b> is imposed on the gains presumed to have been realized by the seller from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets located in the Philippines, including other forms of conditional sale, the Documentary Stamp Tax is imposed on documents, instruments, loan agreements and papers evidencing the acceptance, assignment, sale or transfer of an obligation, rights, or property incident thereto. These two taxes are imposed on the actual price the property has been sold, or on its current Market Value, or on its Zonal Value whichever is higher. Zonal valuation in the Philippines is set by its tax collecting agency, the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Most often, real estate transactions in the Philippines are being sealed higher than their corresponding Market and Zonal values.As a standard process, <b>the</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Gain</b> <b>Tax</b> is {{paid for by the}} seller, while the Documentary Stamp is paid for by the buyer. However, either of the two parties may pay both taxes depending on the agreement they entered into.|$|R
25|$|In October 2008, McCain {{proposed}} {{that the federal government}} buy troubled mortgages, and provide low-interest mortgages to qualified homeowners. For people with 401(k) plans, he wanted to allow more flexibility about when money can be withdrawn, and would lower the tax on that money, as well as lowering the tax on unemployment insurance benefits. McCain also proposed to cut <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> on stock held for more than one year, while increasing the tax write-off for stock losses.|$|E
25|$|Wyden is {{critical}} of the estate tax, which he feels is inefficient, and has voted repeatedly to abolish it. He co-authored the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act, which bans internet taxes in the United States. He has also voted with Republicans to lower <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> to encourage {{the study of the}} flat tax, and to require a 3/5 majority to raise taxes. However, Wyden voted against the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. He has also voted against the balanced budget amendment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} and fall of 2005, he visited {{homeless}} shelters and job training centers and spoke at events organized by ACORN, the NAACP and the SEIU. He spoke in favor of an expansion of the earned income tax credit; in favor of a crackdown on predatory lending; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rate; housing vouchers for racial minorities (to integrate upper-income neighborhoods); and a program modeled on the Works Progress Administration to rehabilitate the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. In Greene County, North Carolina, he unveiled the pilot program for College for Everyone, an educational measure he promised during his presidential campaign, in which prospective college students would receive a scholarship for their first year in exchange for ten hours of work a week. The College for Everyone program was canceled in July 2008.|$|E

50|$|A 1031 {{exchange}} {{is similar to}} a traditional IRA or 401(k) retirement plan. When someone sells assets in tax-deferred retirement plans, <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> that would otherwise be taxable are deferred until the holder begins to cash out of the retirement plan. The same principle holds true for tax-deferred exchanges or real estate investments. As long as the money continues to be re-invested in other real estate, <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> can be deferred. Unlike the aforementioned retirement accounts, rental income on real estate investments will continue to be taxed as net income is realized.|$|R

25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax,</b> Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|Watts ran for Congress in 1994 {{to succeed}} Dave McCurdy, who had {{announced}} his retirement from the House of Representatives {{to run for the}} Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending. After a hard-fought primary campaign against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49percent to Apple's 48percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston. Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92percent name recognition in one poll. Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> as beneficial for urban blacks. Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win. On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52percent of the vote as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction. He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House. Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.|$|E
500|$|Failure of the Carter {{tax plan}} of 1977 – In {{his first year}} in office, Jimmy Carter put forth a {{revision}} to the corporate tax system that would have, among other results, reduced the disparity in treatment of interest paid to bondholders and dividends paid to stockholders. [...] Carter's proposals did not achieve support from the business community or Congress and were not enacted. [...] Because of the different tax treatment, the use of leverage to reduce taxes was popular among private equity investors and would become increasingly popular with the reduction of <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> <b>tax</b> rate.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> that is <b>taxed</b> is {{the excess}} of the sale price over the cost basis of the asset.

Ernest Dumas of the Arkansas Times, a consistent Huckabee critic, responded most of the tax cuts were small deductions and exemptions initiated by the state legislature, that the broad-based tax cut was proposed by his predecessor and Huckabee was [...] "the biggest taxer and spender in Arkansas history." [...] Former Arkansas State Representative Randy Minton (R) has said; [...] " [...] support for taxes split the Republican Party, and damaged our name brand." [...] The group has pointed out that Huckabee publicly opposed the repeal of a sales tax on groceries and medicine in 2002, signed a bill raising taxes on gasoline in 1999, and signed a $5.25 bed-tax on private nursing home patients in 2001.|$|E
