5|$|In {{the western}} fringe of Macedonia, {{which is now}} part of Albania, Jovan Vladimir was remembered as a saintly ruler, cut down by his father-in-law, an emperor, who {{believed}} some slander that he was a womanizer. The enraged emperor, accompanied by soldiers, found Vladimir on a mountain pass named Qafë Thanë (also known as Derven), on the road between the Macedonian town of Struga and Elbasan. He struck his son-in-law with a sword, but could not cut him. Only when Vladimir gave him his own sword was the emperor able to cut off his head. Vladimir took his severed head and went toward the site of his future church. <b>There</b> <b>stood</b> an oak, under which he fell after the tree bowed down before him. The saint was interred in the church which was subsequently built at that place and dedicated to him.|$|E
25|$|Hama grew prosperous {{during the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as}} the Mamluk period. It {{gradually}} expanded to both banks of the Orontes River, with the suburb on the right bank being connected to the town proper by a newly built bridge. The town on the left bank was divided into upper and lower parts, each of which was surrounded by a wall. The city was filled with palaces, markets, mosques, madrasas, and a hospital, and over thirty different sized norias (water-wheels). In addition, <b>there</b> <b>stood</b> a massive citadel in Hama. Moreover, a special aqueduct brought drinking water to Hama from the neighboring town of Salamiyah.|$|E

500|$|Above {{the main}} {{entrance}} of the Chalke, <b>there</b> <b>stood</b> an icon of Christ, the so-called Christ Chalkites ("Christ of the Chalke"). The origins of the icon are obscure: based on its mention in the Parastaseis, it may have existed by ca. 600, but it cannot be stated with any certainty. Its prominent display on the very entrance to the imperial palace made {{it one of the}} city's major religious symbols. Consequently, its removal, in 726 or 730, by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741), was both a major political statement and a spark for violent rioting in the city, and {{marked the beginning of the}} official prohibition of icons in the Empire. The icon was restored a first time by Empress Eirene in ca. 787, until it was again removed by Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820) and replaced by a simple cross. After the definitive restoration of the veneration of icons in 843, a mosaic icon by the famed iconodule monk and artist Lazaros replaced it.|$|E
500|$|As Dougherty {{finished}} his speech, delegates and spectators shouted loudly for Hancock. [...] After five minutes, the cheers subsided. [...] Senator Wade Hampton III of South Carolina, a former Confederate general, next spoke to praise Hancock, saying [...] "we of the South would feel safe in his hands", {{but said that}} Bayard was ultimately his choice [...] "because we believe he is the strongest man". Richard B. Hubbard, a former governor of Texas and Confederate soldier, spoke in favor Hancock as his state seconded the Pennsylvanian's nomination. [...] Hubbard praised Hancock's conduct as military governor of Texas and Louisiana, saying, [...] "in our hour of sorrow, when he held his power {{at the hands of}} the great dominant Republican party... <b>there</b> <b>stood</b> a man with the constitution before him, reading it as the fathers read it; that the war having ended we resumed the habiliments that as a right belong to us, not as a conquered province, but as a free people." [...] The last few states were called and the nominations ended. After a motion to adjourn failed, the delegates proceeded directly to the balloting.|$|E
500|$|Clan MacAulay, or {{the family}} of the MacAulays of Ardincaple, is first {{recorded}} within the lands of Dunbartonshire, which was controlled in the Middle Ages by the mormaers (earls) of Lennox. Within the kindred of the mormaers, forms of the Gaelic given name Amhlaíbh were used by family members; and today the patronymic form of this name can be Anglicised as MacAulay. One such Amhlaíbh was a younger son of Ailín II, Earl of Lennox. This Amhlaíbh {{was the subject of a}} lay attributed to the poet Muireadhach Albanach Ó Dálaigh in which Muireadhach's Lennox property was named Ard nan Each. The Gaelic àrd means [...] "high"; and each means [...] "horse". Amhlaíbh and his descendants were the lords of Faslane and an extensive tract of land along the Gare Loch. The seat of Clan MacAulay was located at Ardincaple, which is situated on the shores of the Gare Loch in what is now the village of Rhu and town of Helensburgh. The place-name Ardincaple has been stated to be derived the Gaelic form of [...] "cape of the horses" [...] and [...] "height of the horses". According to William Charles Maughan writing at the end of the 19th century, the Ardincaple estate had two main residences, one at Ardincaple, the other to the north at Faslane. Maughan stated that the site of the castle of Faslane could be distinguished, at the time of his writing, [...] "by a small mound near the murmuring burn which flows into the bay". Geoffrey Stell's census of mottes in Scotland lists only four in Dunbartonshire; one of which is Faslane (...) , another listed as a [...] "possible" [...] is at Shandon (...) Shandon being located between site of Faslane and the town of Helensburgh. Maughan wrote that at Faslane <b>there</b> <b>stood</b> an oak tree at place called in Scottish Gaelic Cnoch-na-Cullah (English: [...] "knoll of the cock"). According to legend, when a cock crowed beneath the branches of the old oak upon the knoll, a member of Clan MacAulay was about to die.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{native and}} veteran Broadway and silent film {{character}} actor Robert Armstrong played Wray's alcoholic brother in The Most Dangerous Game and, during filming, {{became a member}} of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle. He was a shoo-in as Denham when Kong was cast. The film's romantic angle (rather than its jungle or animal angle) was played-up after animal films fared poorly at the box office in the early months of 1933. One exhibitor displayed a promotional still of Wray swooning in Armstrong's arms with the caption, [...] "Their Hearts Stood Still...For <b>There</b> <b>Stood</b> Kong! A Love Story of Today That Spans the Ages!". Although the film's romantic subplot belongs to Cabot and Wray, established star Armstrong was chosen for the ad rather than the unknown Cabot. Months later, Armstrong again played Carl Denham in Kongs sequel, Son of Kong (1933).|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that with the}} death of the former prophets, the Urim and Thummim ceased.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000[...] In this connection, the Gemara reported differing views of who the former prophets were. Rav Huna said they were David, Samuel, and Solomon. Rav Nachman said that during the days of David, they were sometimes successful and sometimes not (getting an answer from the Urim and Thummim), for Zadok consulted it and succeeded, while Abiathar consulted it and was not successful, as [...] reports, [...] "And Abiathar went up." [...] (He retired from the priesthood because the Urim and Thummim gave him no reply.) Rabbah bar Samuel asked whether the report of 2 Chronicles [...] "And he (King Uzziah of Judah) set himself to seek God all the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God," [...] did not refer to the Urim and Thummim. But the Gemara answered that Uzziah did so through Zechariah's prophecy. A Baraita told that when the first Temple was destroyed, the Urim and Thummim ceased, and explained [...] (reporting events after the Jews returned from the Babylonian Captivity), [...] "And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till <b>there</b> <b>stood</b> up a priest with Urim and Thummim," [...] as a reference to the remote future, as when one speaks of the time of the Messiah. Rav Nachman concluded that the term [...] "former prophets" [...] referred to a period before Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who were latter prophets.. And the Jerusalem Talmud taught that the [...] "former prophets" [...] referred to Samuel and David, and thus the Urim and Thummim did not function in the period of the First Temple, either.|$|E
