5|$|<b>The</b> <b>glove</b> or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing {{between the}} fingers. As an aid in {{catching}} and {{holding onto the}} ball, it takes various shapes to meet {{the specific needs of}} different fielding positions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> boxes.|$|E
5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E

50|$|Kyambi and Muriuki {{then started}} {{to explore how}} they could use <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> {{as a form of}} art and visual conduit. They threw <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> up in <b>the</b> air and watched them fall naturally. As they did so, Muriuki saw the light though <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> as they took {{pictures}} of them in mid air. This process started their series the Conjured Paths, Skies, Herbs, and Gloves.|$|R
2500|$|The {{beautiful}} grisette looked {{sometimes at}} <b>the</b> <b>gloves,</b> then sideways to the window, then at <b>the</b> <b>gloves,</b> {{and then at}} me. [...] I was not disposed to break silence. I followed her example: [...] so, I looked at <b>the</b> <b>gloves,</b> then to <b>the</b> window, then at <b>the</b> <b>gloves,</b> and then at her, and so on alternately. I found I lost considerably in every attack: she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look'd into my very heart and reins. It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did." ...|$|R
5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to <b>the</b> <b>glove,</b> the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, {{a far cry from}} the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
2500|$|July 2011 saw Heap unveil {{a pair of}} in-development, {{high-tech}} musical <b>gloves</b> at <b>the</b> TEDGlobal {{conference in}} Edinburgh, Scotland. Inspired by the VAMP [...] system developed by Elly Jessop at MIT's media lab, Heap set out to develop <b>the</b> musical <b>gloves</b> in collaboration with Thomas Mitchell, a lecturer in music systems at the University of the West of England, Bristol. <b>The</b> <b>gloves</b> combine sensors developed by 5DT, x-io Technologies [...] with Shure microphones. Both Heap's and Elly Jessop's musical gloves are similar to <b>The</b> Lady's <b>Glove,</b> an earlier invention by the electronic sound pioneer Laetitia Sonami, and <b>the</b> midi <b>gloves</b> used since 1989 by Steve Hogarth lead singer of Marillion. While still in prototype stage, Heap used her MiMu gloves to record [...] "Me the Machine", the first song created solely with <b>the</b> <b>gloves.</b> <b>The</b> song was released on her latest album, Sparks, originally titled [...] "heapsong11". In an attempt {{to raise money for}} further research, Heap toured the song and <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> at a number of venues and has been working with artists to discover the full potential of <b>the</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gloves</b> are well-knitted with {{decorative}} stitches on {{the upper}} palms and gauntlets. They are similar to other <b>gloves</b> of <b>the</b> period. The palm of <b>the</b> right <b>glove</b> is more worn and patched than <b>the</b> left <b>glove,</b> suggesting he was right-handed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Golden <b>Gloves</b> is {{an amateur}} boxing tournament that is fought {{at both the}} {{national}} level and the regional level. Although <b>the</b> Golden <b>Gloves</b> typically refers to <b>the</b> National Golden <b>Gloves,</b> it can also refer to <b>the</b> Intercity Golden <b>Gloves,</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Golden <b>Gloves,</b> <b>the</b> New York Golden Gloves, and other regional Golden <b>Gloves</b> tournaments. <b>The</b> winners of the regional tournaments fight in a national competition annually.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat the ball out of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way to first base. Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in riot gear took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct call when they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series crew chief.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{of blood on}} a left-hand glove, found outside Brown's home, showed {{that it was a}} mixture of Simpson's, Brown's, and Goldman's blood. Although <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> was soaked in blood, there were no blood drops leading up to, or away from <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> No other blood was found in the area of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> except on <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{occupational}} {{skin disease}} is Glove related hand urticaria. It has been reported as an occupational problem among the health care workers.

25|$|All {{polonium}} compounds, such as polonium dioxide, {{are extremely}} radioactive and thus must be handled in a glove box. <b>The</b> <b>glove</b> box must further be enclosed in another box similar to <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box, maintained at a slightly lower pressure than <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> box {{to prevent the}} radioactive materials from leaking out.

5000|$|Another of Simpson's attorneys, F. Lee Bailey, {{had also}} been {{studying}} <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> {{for a long time}} and had reached a similar conclusion, that <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> did not fit Simpson and if they could be shown not to in open court, the prosecution's case would fall apart. When he saw Shapiro try on <b>the</b> <b>gloves,</b> he sensed an opportunity. The defense lawyers realized early on that Darden had [...] "hot buttons" [...] which, if pressed, would lead him to act rashly, to the possible detriment of the prosecution.|$|R

5000|$|The {{murder trial}} began on July 11, 2008. [...] At trial, the State Prosecutors portrayed Rosa {{as the sole}} murderer who killed Tomlinson. Prosecutors theorized that, after a scuffle with his victim and {{subsequent}} strangulation, Rosa tried to hide the evidence by using a nail clipper to clip off Tomlinson's fingernails. The prosecutor also presented the same jogging pants that Rosa was wearing {{on the night of}} the murder and showed the jury blood stains belonging to Tomlinson within the inner sleeve of the pants. With the same pair of white gloves that were taken from Rosa, the prosecutors showed the jury that Rosa used <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> to either suffocate or to keep Tomlinson quiet by placing <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> in Tomlinson's mouth. The blood pattern stains on <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> showed <b>the</b> position <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> had been placed on Tomlinson's mouth.|$|R
25|$|If the batsman {{hits the}} ball with the bat (or with <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> when <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> is {{in contact with the}} bat) and the ball is caught by the bowler or a fielder before it hits the ground, then the batsman is out.|$|E
25|$|Points are the three, or {{sometimes}} single, line of decorative stitching {{on the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b>|$|E
25|$|If the {{prevailing}} fashion be {{to reject the}} long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a draw-string or armlet. But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When it is fair, smooth, and round, it will admit of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> being pushed down to a little above the wrists.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>gloves</b> {{are also}} {{attached}} via a locking ring and are likewise in international orange color. These {{can be put}} on more easily and more quickly than was possible with the launch entry suit, and ball bearings allow the wrist to [...] "swivel". When the suit is pressurized, <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> are also pressurized. The palm of <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> is textured to allow crews to throw switches, push buttons, turn knobs (especially the [...] "ABORT MODE" [...] knob on the commander's panel), and, for the Commander and Pilot, to operate the flight control stick during the final approach during landing.|$|R

25|$|Batsmen {{are allowed}} to wear gloves while batting. The batsman can be also caught out if the ball touches <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> instead of the bat, {{provided}} the hand is {{in contact with the}} bat. This is because <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> is considered to be the extension of the bat. The batsman may also wear protective helmets usually with a visor to protect themselves. Helmets are usually employed when facing fast bowlers. While playing spinners, it might not be employed.|$|E

25|$|Leather is {{a natural}} product with special {{characteristics}} that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it {{is a natural}} product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer's hand. As this occurs the leather of <b>the</b> <b>glove</b> will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as 'breaking-in' <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> Overtime wear spots may appear on {{certain parts of the}} palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer's hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.|$|E
