5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> in the Deseret {{alphabet}} died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already {{regarded as a}} failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive {{and even the most}} devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich's family held social {{standing}} and substantial financial means. Music {{was a part}} of Heydrich's everyday life; his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music, Theatre and Teaching and his mother taught piano there. Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.|$|E
5|$|If {{the bank}} system enhances credit, it {{will at least}} {{temporarily}} diminish the market interest rate below the natural rate. Wicksell had defined the natural rate as <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rate which is compatible with a stable price level. Credit creation and credit destruction induce changes in the price level and {{in the level of}} economic activity. This is referred to as Wicksell's Cumulative process.|$|E

5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, {{and many of his}} decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks, for example, <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Blackstone's decision in Goldswain's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Renowned for his preaching, Baldwin's {{surviving}} sermons show <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> in them continued {{after his}} death. His sermons were {{first published in}} 1662; the modern edition includes two more (titled de obedientia and de sancta cruce) that {{were not in the}} original publication. It appears that originally there were 33 sermons, with the others now lost. The sermons survive in 12 manuscripts, although only 5 are collections of substantial numbers of the works. None of the surviving manuscripts has a complete collection of the 22 sermons.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That {{he was in no}} small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of its}} birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E

5|$|Profits for the {{undertaking}} showed a steady rise, {{due in part}} to the low maintenance costs of the river. Income from tolls rose from £321 in 1712 to £1,137 by 1802. By this time, traffic consisted of about 11,500tons of coal carried from Bridgwater upstream out of a total tonnage of 14,000tons. Dividends for 1797 were 11.5%, but the capital debt had risen to £85,466 by 1800, when the auditors refused to examine the accounts, because the likelihood of the poor ever benefitting from the navigation was receding. After much negotiation, the capital debt was reduced to £13,000. An act of parliament dated 14 July 1804 enshrined this position, and ensured <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> was limited to six percent, with profits being used to reduce the debt. By 1828, the amount owing had reduced to £4,426.|$|E

It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, {{and the owner of}} <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian {{theory of}} capital and {{interest}} was first developed by Eugen Böhm von Bawerk. He stated <b>that</b> <b>interest</b> rates and profits are determined by two factors, namely, supply and demand {{in the market for}} final goods and time preference.|$|E
25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's theory equates capital {{intensity}} with {{the degree of}} roundaboutness of production processes.
