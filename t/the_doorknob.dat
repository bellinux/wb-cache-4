2500|$|The [...] "Conjectural Sound" [...] {{principle}} applies even to happenstance sounds, such as tires squealing, doorknobs turning {{or people}} walking. [...] If the sound editor wants to communicate that a driver is {{in a hurry}} to leave, he will cut the sound of tires squealing when the car accelerates from a stop; even if the car is on a dirt road, the effect will work if the audience is dramatically engaged. [...] If a character is afraid of someone {{on the other side of}} a door, the turning of <b>the</b> <b>doorknob</b> can take a second or more, and the mechanism of the knob can possess dozens of clicking parts. [...] A skillful Foley artist can make someone walking calmly across the screen seem terrified simply by giving the actor a different gait.|$|E
2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just shouted over some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let <b>the</b> <b>doorknob</b> hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone. The exception is {{the floor of the}} rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass. The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above. <b>The</b> <b>doorknobs</b> are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of <b>the</b> original brass <b>doorknobs</b> have disappeared over time). <b>The</b> present <b>doorknobs</b> and hinges, locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|R

25|$|The {{principal}} architect was Arthur Brown, Jr., of Bakewell & Brown, whose {{attention to}} the finishing details extended to <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> and <b>the</b> typeface {{to be used in}} signage. Brown's blueprints of the building are preserved at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Brown also designed the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and the Federal office building at 50 United Nations Plaza.|$|R
50|$|Underneath UC Berkeley's oldest {{buildings}} is {{a system}} of steam tunnels which carry steam for heat and power. During the 1960s, Berkeley students chained <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> of <b>the</b> Chancellor's office in protest over the Vietnam War. The Chancellor, having no other way {{in or out of}} the building, used the steam tunnels to escape. Afterwards, the exterior double doors on that building were changed so they only had one doorknob, and this remains today.|$|R
50|$|To {{accommodate}} its workers, {{the coal}} company built four-room {{houses on the}} east side of town and the five and six room houses on the south side. The houses were prefabricated Sears Catalog Homes shipped by railroad to the mine and then delivered to the building sites by wagon. Some of the families were living in tents and were so anxious to move in that they did so before <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> were placed on the doors.|$|R

60|$|With {{her hand}} on <b>the</b> <b>doorknob,</b> she paused to wonder what she should say when he asked her why she had not told him of Anna's {{marriage}} when it occurred--why she had still continued the deception when it had no longer an end to serve. Well, she would tell him the truth--that {{it was because she}} could not bear the thought of giving up writing to him. It was a humiliating thing to confess, but that did not matter--nothing mattered now. She opened the door.|$|E

"When I had {{somewhat}} {{recovered from}} the dazing effect of the transition from uproar to silence, my first impulse was to reopen the door which I had closed, and from the knob of which I was not conscious of having removed my hand; I felt it distinctly, still in the clasp of my fingers. My notion was to ascertain by stepping again into the storm whether I had been deprived of sight and hearing. I turned <b>the</b> <b>doorknob</b> and pulled open the door. It led into another room! ...|$|E
50|$|Located next to Omaha's second City Hall, the Bee Building {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} Rosewater family's former homestead. It was a seven-story red granite structure, with {{detailing}} such as carved beehives as exterior ornaments and carved miniature beehives on <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs,</b> playing off <b>the</b> name of the newspaper. Built for almost $500,000, it was touted by the Bee as the world's largest newspaper plant. Circulation in 1889 was 18,736. The noted Omaha National Bank Building was built the same year on the same block.|$|R

A pair of marble bas reliefs by Boris Gilbertson adorn the walls: one of moose and the other of buffalo. The buffalo motif is found throughout the building including in the Departmental Seal and on <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> of <b>the</b> Secretary of the Interior's Executive Suite. The Executive Suite has oak paneling with a marble fireplace. Besides offices, the building contains an auditorium, museum, Indian arts and crafts gift shop, library, post office and gymnasium-all {{part of the original}} design.|$|R
60|$|His lordship nodded stupidly, {{and strode}} to the door. His {{departure}} was observed in silence. On every face he read his sentence. These men--rakes though they were, professedly--would own him no more for their associate; and what these men thought to-night not a gentleman in town but would be thinking the same tomorrow. He had the stupidity to lay it all to the score of Mr. Caryll, not perceiving that he had brought it upon himself by his own aggressiveness. He paused, his hand upon <b>the</b> <b>doorknob,</b> and turned to loose a last shaft at them.|$|E
60|$|But not his deliverance, though {{even then}} remorse struck him. His shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired {{to make room}} for the other and better one. For, to temper his thrill of joy, the shine of the satin and the glimmer of {{ornaments}} recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled Amazon, and the base duplicate histories lit by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds. It is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes, either to praise or blame the man. But this time his love overcame his scruples. He took a quick step, and reached out his hand for <b>the</b> <b>doorknob.</b> Father Rogan was quicker to arrest it and draw him back.|$|E
60|$|I was {{familiar}} enough with earthquakes to know that, {{with the second}} shock or subsidence of the earth, the immediate danger was passed, and so I was able to note more clearly what else was passing. There was the usual sudden stampede of hurrying feet, the solitary oath and scream, the half-hysterical laughter, and silence. Then the tumult was reawakened {{to the sound of}} high voices, talking all together, or the impatient calling of absentees in halls and corridors. Then I heard the quick swish of female skirts on the staircase, and one of the fair guests knocked impatiently {{at the door of the}} end room, still immovably fixed. At the first knock there was a sudden cessation of the hurried whisperings and turning of <b>the</b> <b>doorknob.</b>|$|E

On television, Brown played the {{character}} Daisy on the CBS soap opera Love of Life in 1971, and she originated {{the role of}} Chantel on the NBC soap Generations from 1989 to 1990.

5000|$|After {{restoring}} electricity, {{and exploring}} {{inside the house}} you discover that Roxy has several types of ghost hunting equipment: surveillance cameras, the BAR (Bulbic Activity Reader), a doorknob sensor which detects spiritual residue in <b>doorknobs,</b> <b>the</b> PeeK, a pocket television-like device which allows the user {{to listen to the}} sounds in <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs,</b> and works with the BAR and cameras to observe spiritual activity from a safe distance, and the AMBER (Astral Mobility By Electromagnetic Resonance) headset device itself, which allows the user to actually enter the minds of ghosts to discover what they are thinking and seeing and to remind them of who they are so they may ascend. The last device is still in the testing phase and its use is considered to be very risky. Apparently Roxy's spirit is lost [...] "somewhere" [...] while she was attempting to use the AMBER device.|$|R
50|$|The style first {{appeared}} in Brussels' HÃ´tel Tassel (1894) and HÃ´tel Solvay (1900) of Victor Horta. The HÃ´tel Tassel was visited by Hector Guimard, who used the same style in his first major work, the Castel BÃ©ranger (1897-98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel BÃ©ranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new Paris MÃ©tro, which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became {{the symbol of the}} Art Nouveau movement in Paris.|$|R

50|$|Security screen doors add {{a second}} set of hinges or locks to defeat before access to a {{structure}} can be granted. If the intention is to keep thieves out, or keep disturbed individuals in, this is a better solution. Security screen doors also make it possible to open the main door, and communicate with those outside. Some even have mail slots. As an added benefit, security screen doors can allow the door to be opened, and provide for secure ventilation. The main downside is the cost, which is generally about as much as a regular door, and locks are usually sold separately. Installation can also be difficult, as <b>the</b> <b>doorknobs</b> of <b>the</b> two doors may interfere with each other, and the screen material usually interferes with any peephole devices on the door.|$|R
