2500|$|At {{the time}} of the bombing, an obscure group called the [...] "Islamic Jihad" [...] claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack. There were many in the U.S. government, such as Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz, and National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane (who was formerly Reagan's Mideast envoy), who believed Iran and/or Syria were/was responsible for the bombings. After some years of investigation, the U.S. government now believes that elements of what would eventually become Hezbollah, backed by Iran and Syria, were responsible for these bombings as well as the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut earlier in April. It is believed that Hezbollah used the name [...] "Islamic Jihad" [...] to remain anonymous. Hezbollah eventually announced its existence in 1985. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>while,</b> according to President Reagan's Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "We still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn't then". Weinberger mentions lack of certainty about Syria or Iran's involvement as the reason why America did not take any retaliatory actions against those states. To date, Hezbollah, Iran and Syria have continued to deny any involvement in any of the bombings. A fanatic Iranian group erected a monument in a cemetery in Tehran to commemorate the 1983 bombings and its [...] "martyrs" [...] in 2004.|$|E

60|$|The three chief requisites, I should say, are: (1) The {{establishment}} of an orderly Government; (2) industrial development under Chinese control; (3) The spread of education. All these aims {{will have to be}} pursued concurrently, but on the whole their urgency seems to me to come in the above order. We have already seen how large a part the State will have to take in building up industry, and how impossible <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>while</b> the political anarchy continues. Funds for education on a large scale are also unobtainable until there is good government. Therefore good government is the prerequisite of all other reforms. Industrialism and education are closely connected, and {{it would be difficult to}} decide the priority between them; but I have put industrialism first, because, unless it is developed very soon by the Chinese, foreigners will have acquired such a strong hold that it will be very difficult indeed to oust them. These reasons have decided me that our three problems ought to be taken in the above order.|$|E
