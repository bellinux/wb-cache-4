Mayweather offers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E

25|$|Full VTOL {{testing at}} Edwards AFB was delayed pending the {{availability}} of the 7,100 shp Allison YT54, which never materialized. After the brief unintentional hop, the aircraft made a total of 32 flights. All further XFV-1 flights did not involve any vertical takeoffs or landings. The XFV-1 was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> transitions in flight from the conventional to the vertical flight mode and back, and had briefly held in hover at altitude. Performance remained limited by the confines of the flight test regime. With the realization that the XFV's top speeds would be eclipsed by contemporary fighters and that only highly experienced pilots could fly the aircraft, the project was cancelled in June 1955.|$|E

While saying the group would assemble to record new material, Lee announced the release of The Open Door to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com. The album progressed slowly because of Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure, and the loss of their former manager. Lee said on a fan's internet forum the new recording would be completed in March 2006; the release was postponed because [...] "Wind-up Records...wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> changes to the upcoming single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober".
