30|$|Although <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> {{into the}} spinal canal {{represents}} an infrequent complication of neurofibromatous spinal deformities, {{it must be}} excluded during preoperative radiological evaluation, {{even in the absence}} of neurological deficits.

To this purpose, a pre-operative study with the use of radiographs and MRI scan is recommended in order to identify the abnormality. Even if MRI does not seem to be specific, it may raise concerns of the lesion, by a careful observation of axial and sagittal images of thoracic spine, with a particular attention in the examination at the apex of the curve.

40|$|The lung-expanding {{action of}} the {{diaphragm}} is primarily related to the descent of the dome produced by the shortening of the muscle fibers. However, when the phrenic nerves in dogs are selectively stimulated at functional residual capacity, the muscle insertions into the lower ribs also move caudally. This rib motion should enhance the descent of the dome and increase the fall in pleural pressure (DeltaPpl). To quantify the role of this mechanism in determining DeltaPpl during isolated diaphragm contraction and to evaluate the volume dependence of this role, radiopaque markers were attached to muscle bundles in the midcostal region of the muscle in six animals, and the three-dimensional location of the markers during relaxation at different lung volumes and during phrenic nerve stimulation at the same lung volumes was measured using computed tomography. From these data, accurate measurements of muscle length, dome <b>displacement,</b> and lower <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> were obtained. The values of dome displacement were then corrected for lower <b>rib</b> <b>displacement,</b> and the values of DeltaPpl corresponding to the corrected dome displacements were obtained using the measured relationship between DeltaPpl and dome displacement. The measurements showed that phrenic stimulation at all lung volumes causes a caudal displacement of the lower ribs and that this displacement, taken alone, contributes approximately 25 % of the DeltaPpl produced by the diaphragm. To the extent that this lower <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> is itself caused by DeltaPpl, the lung-expanding {{action of the}} diaphragm during isolated contraction may therefore {{be viewed as a}} self-facilitating phenomenon.

40|$|High-frequency {{mechanical}} vibration of the ribcage increases afferent activity from external intercostal muscle spindles, {{but the effect}} of this procedure on the mechanical behaviour of the respiratory system is unknown. In the present study, we have measured the changes in external intercostal muscle length and the craniocaudal <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> during ribcage vibration (40 Hz) in anaesthetized dogs. With vibration, external intercostal inspiratory activity increased by ∼ 50 %, but the respiratory changes in muscle length and <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> were unaltered. A similar response was obtained after the muscles in the caudal segments of the ribcage were sectioned and the caudally oriented force exerted by these muscles on the rib was removed, thus suggesting that activation of external intercostal muscle spindles by vibration generates little tension. Prompted by this observation, we also examined the role played by the external intercostal muscle spindles in determining the respiratory <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> during breathing against high inspiratory airflow resistances. Although resistances consistently elicited prominent reflex increases in external intercostal inspiratory activity, the normal inspiratory cranial <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> was reversed into an inspiratory caudal displacement.

40|$|Abstract  The {{diaphragm}} has an inspiratory {{action on}} the lower ribs, and current conventional wisdom maintains that this action {{is the result of}} two mechanisms, namely, the force applied by the muscle fibres on the ribs into which they insert (insertional force) and the transmission of abdominal pressure through the zone of apposition (appositional force). The magnitude of the diaphragmatic force and the relative contributions of the insertional and appositional components, however, are unknown. To assess these forces, the inspiratory intercostal muscles in all interspaces were severed in anaesthetized dogs, so that the diaphragm was the only muscle active during inspiration, and the displacements of the lower ribs along the craniocaudal and laterolateral axes were measured during quiet breathing, during occluded breaths and during passive lung inflation. From these data, the isolated effects of pleural pressure and transdiaphragmatic pressure on <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> were determined. Then external forces were applied to the ribs in the cranial and the lateral direction to simulate, respectively, the effects of the insertional and appositional forces, and the rib trajectories for these external forces were used as the basis for a vector analysis to obtain the relative magnitudes of the insertional and appositional contributions to the <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> driven by transdiaphragmatic pressure. The results show that, per unit pressure, the inspiratory effect of the diaphragmatic force on the lower ribs is equal to the expiratory effect of pleural pressure, and that the insertional force contributes 60 % of that inspiratory effect.

25|$|Front limbs are nonexistent in {{all known}} snakes. This {{is caused by}} the {{evolution}} of their Hox genes, controlling limb morphogenesis. The axial skeleton of the snakes’ common ancestor, like most other tetrapods, had regional specializations consisting of cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral (pelvic), and caudal (tail) vertebrae. Early in snake evolution, the Hox gene expression in the axial skeleton responsible {{for the development of the}} thorax became dominant. As a result, the vertebrae anterior to the hindlimb buds (when present) all have the same thoracic-like identity (except from the atlas, axis, and 1–3 neck vertebrae). In other words, most of a snake's skeleton is an extremely extended <b>thorax.</b> <b>Ribs</b> are found exclusively on the thoracic vertebrae. Neck, lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are very reduced in number (only 2–10 lumbar and pelvic vertebrae are present), while only a short tail remains of the caudal vertebrae. However, the tail is still long enough to be of important use in many species, and is modified in some aquatic and tree-dwelling species.|$|R

40|$|In the dog, the {{elevation}} of the ribs during inspiration results from the combined actions of the parasternal and external intercostal muscles. In the present studies, the hypothesis was tested that co-ordinated activity among these two sets of muscles reduces the distortion of the rib cage. During spontaneous inspiration before or after section of the phrenic nerves, the ribs moved cranially and outward {{in the same way}} as they did during passive inflation. However, whereas the sternum moved cranially during passive inflation, it was displaced caudally during spontaneous inspiration. When the parasternal intercostal muscles were selectively denervated, both the sternum and the ribs moved cranially, but the <b>rib</b> outward <b>displacement</b> was markedly reduced. In contrast, when the external intercostals were excised and the parasternal intercostals were left intact, the sternum continued to move caudally and the outward <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> was augmented relative to their cranial displacement. These observations establish that the external intercostal muscles drive the ribs primarily in the cranial direction, whereas the parasternal intercostals drive the ribs both cranially and outward. They also indicate, in agreement with the hypothesis, that co-ordinated activity among these two sets of muscles displaces the ribs on their relaxation curve. However, this co-ordinated activity also displaces the sternum caudally. Although this distortion requires an additional energy expenditure, it enhances the outward component of <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> which is more effective with respect to lung expansion...|$|R

40|$|Key points: Subjects {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease and hyperinflation commonly have an inward {{displacement of the}} lateral walls of the lower rib cage during inspiration. This paradoxical displacement, conventionally called 'Hoover's sign', is traditionally attributed to the pull by radially oriented diaphragmatic muscle fibres. In this study in anaesthetized dogs, we measured the displacement of the lower ribs during isolated spontaneous diaphragm contraction at different lung volumes, and determined the separate effects on <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> of pleural pressure and of the force exerted by the diaphragm. The results show that diaphragm contraction at low lung volumes causes an inspiratory displacement of the lower ribs, but this is progressively reversed into an expiratory displacement as lung volume increases. However, the effect of the force exerted by the diaphragm on the ribs remains inspiratory at all lung volumes. These observations suggest that Hoover's sign is usually caused by the dominant expiratory effect of pleural pressure on the lower ribs, rather than an inward pull from the diaphragm. The normal diaphragm has an inspiratory action on the lower ribs, but subjects with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} commonly have an inward displacement of the lateral portions of the lower rib cage during inspiration. This paradoxical displacement, conventionally called 'Hoover's sign', has traditionally been attributed to the direct action of radially oriented diaphragmatic muscle fibres. In the present study, the inspiratory intercostal muscles in all interspaces in anaesthetized dogs were severed so that the diaphragm was the only muscle active during inspiration. The displacements of the lower ribs along the craniocaudal and laterolateral axes and the changes in pleural pressure ({increment}Ppl) and transdiaphragmatic pressure were measured during occluded breaths and mechanical ventilation at different lung volumes between functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity. From these data, the separate effects on <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> of {increment}Ppl and of the force exerted by the diaphragm on the ribs were determined. Isolated spontaneous diaphragm contraction at FRC displaced the lower ribs cranially and outward, but this motion was progressively reversed into a caudal and inward motion as lung volume increased. However, although the force exerted by the diaphragm on the ribs decreased with increasing volume, it continued to displace the ribs cranially and outward. These observations suggest that Hoover's sign is usually caused by the decrease in the zone of apposition and, thus, by the dominant effect of {increment}Ppl on the lower ribs, rather than an inward pull from the diaphragm.

Common reasons are vertebral subluxation, dislocation, angulation and tumorous lesions around the spinal canal. Only twelve cases of intraspinal rib dislocation {{have been reported in}} the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of rib penetration through neural foramen at the apex of a scoliotic curve in neurofibromatosis and to introduce a new clinical sign for its detection. Methods A 13 -year-old girl was evaluated for progressive left thoracic kyphoscoliotic curve due to a type I neurofibromatosis. Clinical examination revealed multiple large thoracic and abdominal "cafe-au-lait" spots, neurological impairment of the lower limbs and the presence of a thoracic gibbous that was painful to pressure at the level of the left eighth rib (Painful Rib Hump). CT-scan showed detachment and translocation of the cephalic end of the left eighth rib into the adjacent enlarged neural foramen. The M. R.

40|$|Received 12 June 2015; revised 26 October 2015; {{accepted}} 29 October 2015; Epub 2015 Nov 17 Objectives: Sagittal and axial rib orientation {{relative to}} the spine are two factors that modify rib cage morphology during ontogeny. Some studies suggest that these factors do not operate {{in the same way}} at the upper (ribs 1 – 5) and lower <b>thorax</b> (<b>ribs</b> 6 – 10) during postnatal growth, but it is unknown if the ontogenetic thoracic changes are produced by morphological changes of the ribs (intrinsic rib factors) or by external factors related to costal joints (extrinsic rib factors). Material and methods: To clarify these questions, we applied 3 D geometric morphometrics of landmarks and sliding semilandmarks (N[*]=[*] 20 /rib) to 280 individual ribs (1 – 10) of Homo sapiens comprising the entire human ontogeny and growth simulations were carried out. Results: PCA shows that intrinsic rib factors (rib torsion and axial rib curvature) are ontogenetic factors of variability that contribute to configuring the adult thorax shape. Moreover, growth simulations and regression slopes suggest that the upper thorax unit is comprised by ribs 1 – 7 and the lower unit at least by ribs 8 – 10. Discussion: These results suggest anatomical constraints for ontogenetic rib variation, since ribs 1 – 7 (true ribs) are directly linked to the sternum. Moreover, these results are supported by functional anatomy because pulmonary kinematics would influence the upper unit and diaphragmatic kinematics would influence the lower one. Our findings are relevant not only to understanding how changes at individual ribs contribute to the adult thorax morphology, but also to the development and evolution of the modern human rib cage.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional theory, the external and internal intercostal muscles show marked rostrocaudal gradients in their actions on the lung. We hypothesized that these gradients {{are the result of}} a non-uniform coupling between the ribs and the lung. <b>Rib</b> <b>displacements</b> (Xr) and the changes in airway opening pressure (Pa,o) were thus measured in anaesthetized, pancuronium-treated, supine dogs while loads were applied in the cranial direction to individual pairs of odd-numbered ribs and in the caudal direction to individual pairs of even-numbered ribs. During cranial loading, Xr induced by a given load increased gradually with increasing rib number. The decrease in Pa,o also increased from the third to the fifth rib pair but then decreased markedly to the eleventh pair. A similar pattern was observed during caudal loading, although Xr and ΔPa,o were smaller. These results were then combined to calculate the net Xr and the net ΔPa,o that a hypothetical intercostal muscle lying parallel to the longitudinal body axis would produce in different interspaces. The net Xr was cranial in all interspaces. However, whereas the net ΔPa,o was negative in the cranial interspaces, it was positive in the caudal interspaces. These observations confirm that the coupling between the ribs and the lung varies from the top {{to the base of the}} ribcage. This coupling confers to both the external and the internal intercostal muscles an inspiratory action on the lung in the cranial interspaces and an expiratory action in the caudal interspaces...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral {{bronchial}} occlusion, a {{complication of}} many lung diseases, causes dyspnea but {{the mechanism of}} this symptom is uncertain. In this study, electromyographic (EMG) activity in the parasternal and external intercostal muscles in the third intercostal space and inspiratory motion of the third rib {{on both sides of}} the thorax were assessed during occlusion of a main bronchus for a single breath in anesthetized dogs. Occlusion produced a 65 % increase in external intercostal EMG activity in both hemithoraces without altering parasternal EMG activity. Concomitantly, the inspiratory cranial rib motion showed a 50 % decrease {{on both sides of the}} thorax. These changes were unaffected by bilateral vagotomy. However, when an external, caudally oriented force was applied to the third rib on the right or left side so that its inspiratory cranial displacement was abolished, activity in the adjacent external intercostals showed a twofold increase, but rib motion and external activity in the contralateral hemithorax remained unchanged. It is concluded that during occlusion of a main bronchus, the increase in external intercostal activity is induced by the decrease in inspiratory cranial <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> in both hemithoraces, and that this decrease is determined by the increase in pleural pressure swings on both sides of the mediastinum. This mechanism, combined with the decrease in PaO 2, induces similar alterations when unilateral bronchial occlusion is maintained for a series of consecutive breaths.

40|$|The inspiratory {{intercostal}} muscles elevate the ribs and thereby elicit a fall in pleural pressure (DeltaPpl) when they contract. In the present study, we initially tested {{the hypothesis that}} this DeltaPpl does, in turn, oppose the rib elevation. The cranial <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> (Xr) produced by selective activation of the parasternal intercostal muscle in the fourth interspace was measured in dogs, first with the rib cage intact and then after DeltaPpl was eliminated by bilateral pneumothorax. For a given parasternal contraction, Xr was greater after pneumothorax; the increase in Xr per unit decrease in DeltaPpl was 0. 98 +/- 0. 11 mm/cmH 2 O. Because this relation {{was similar to that}} obtained during isolated diaphragmatic contraction, we subsequently tested the hypothesis that the increase in Xr observed during breathing after diaphragmatic paralysis was, in part, the result of the decrease in DeltaPpl, and the contribution of the difference in DeltaPpl to the difference in Xr was determined by using the relation between Xr and DeltaPpl during passive inflation. With diaphragmatic paralysis, Xr during inspiration increased approximately threefold, and 47 +/- 8 % of this increase was accounted for by the decrease in DeltaPpl. These observations indicate that 1) DeltaPpl is a primary determinant of rib motion during intercostal muscle contraction and 2) the decrease in DeltaPpl and the increase in intercostal muscle activity contribute equally to the increase in inspiratory cranial <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> after diaphragm paralysis.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantages of}} the external and internal intercostals depend partly on {{the orientation of the}} muscle but mostly on interspace number and the position of the muscle within each interspace. Thus the external intercostals in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces have a large inspiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases ventrally and caudally such that in the ventral portion of the caudal interspaces, it is reversed into an expiratory mechanical advantage. The internal interosseous intercostals in the caudal interspaces also have a large expiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases cranially and, for the upper interspaces, ventrally as well. The intercartilaginous portion of the internal intercostals (the so-called parasternal intercostals), therefore, has an inspiratory mechanical advantage, whereas the triangularis sterni has a large expiratory mechanical advantage. These rostrocaudal gradients result from the nonuniform coupling between <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> and lung expansion, and the dorsoventral gradients result from the three-dimensional configuration of the rib cage. Such topographic differences in mechanical advantage imply that the functions of the muscles during breathing are largely determined by the topographic distributions of neural drive. The distributions of inspiratory and expiratory activity among the muscles are strikingly similar to the distributions of inspiratory and expiratory mechanical advantages, respectively. As a result, the external intercostals and the parasternal intercostals have an inspiratory function during breathing, whereas the internal interosseous intercostals and the triangularis sterni have an expiratory function...|$|R
40|$|When the {{diaphragm}} contracts, pleural pressure falls, exerting a caudal and inward {{force on the}} entire rib cage. However, {{the diaphragm}} also exerts forces in the cranial and outward direction on the lower ribs. One of these forces, the insertional force, is applied by the muscle at its attachments to the lower ribs. The second, the appositional force, {{is due to the}} transmission of abdominal pressure to the lower rib cage in the zone of apposition. In the control condition at functional residual capacity, the effects of these two forces on the lower ribs are nearly equal and outweigh the effect of pleural pressure, whereas for the upper ribs, the effect of pleural pressure is greater. The balance between these effects, however, may be altered. When the abdomen is given a mechanical support, the insertional and appositional forces are increased, so that the muscle produces a larger expansion of the lower rib cage and, with it, a smaller retraction of the upper rib cage. In contrast, at higher lung volumes the zone of apposition is decreased, and pleural pressure is the dominant force on the lower ribs as well. Consequently, although the force exerted by the diaphragm on these ribs remains inspiratory, <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> is reversed into a caudal-inward displacement. This mechanism likely explains the inspiratory retraction of the lateral walls of the lower rib cage observed in many subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Hoover's sign). These observations support the use of a three-compartment, rather than a two-compartment, model to describe chest wall mechanics. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Inflation induces {{a marked}} {{decrease}} in the lung-expanding ability of the diaphragm, but {{its effect on the}} parasternal intercostal muscles is uncertain. To assess this effect, the phrenic nerves and the external intercostals were severed in anesthetized, vagotomized dogs, such that the parasternal intercostals were the only muscles active during inspiration, and the endotracheal tube was occluded at different lung volumes. Although the inspiratory electromyographic activity recorded from the muscles was constant, the change in airway opening pressure decreased with inflation from - 7. 2 +/- 0. 6 cmH 2 O at functional residual capacity to - 2. 2 +/- 0. 2 cmH 2 O at 20 -cmH 2 O transrespiratory pressure (P< 0. 001). The inspiratory cranial <b>displacement</b> of the <b>ribs</b> remained virtually unchanged, and the inspiratory caudal displacement of the sternum decreased moderately. However, the inspiratory outward <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> decreased markedly and continuously; at 20 cmH 2 O, this displacement was only 23 +/- 2 % of the value at functional residual capacity. Calculations based on this alteration yielded substantial decreases in the change in airway opening pressure. It is concluded that, in the dog, 1) inflation affects adversely the lung-expanding actions of both the parasternal intercostals and the diaphragm; and 2) the adverse effect of inflation on the parasternal intercostals is primarily related to the alteration in the kinematics of the ribs. As a corollary, it is likely that hyperinflation also has a negative impact on the parasternal intercostals in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Estimated maximum respiratory effects of the inspiratory and expiratory muscle groups of the entire rib cage were tested by measuring the maximum inspiratory pressures that were generated by the parasternal and external intercostals acting alone.

In the first, all the inspiratory intercostal muscles were severed, so that the diaphragm was the only muscle active during inspiration, and the normal inspiratory cranial displacement of the lower ribs was suppressed at regular intervals. In the second experiment, the animals were given a muscle relaxant to abolish respiratory muscle activity, and external, cranially oriented forces were applied to the lower rib pairs to simulate {{the action of the}} diaphragm on these ribs. The data showed that 1) holding the lower ribs stationary during spontaneous, isolated diaphragm contraction had no effect on the change in lung volume during unimpeded inspiration and no effect on the fall in pleural pressure (Ppl) during occluded breaths; 2) the procedure, however, caused an increase in the caudal displacement of the upper ribs; and 3) pulling the lower rib pairs cranially induced a cranial displacement of the upper ribs and a small fall in Ppl. These observations indicate that the force applied on the lower ribs by the diaphragm during spontaneous contraction, acting through the interdependence of the ribs, is transmitted to the upper ribs and has an inspiratory effect on the lung.

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} ribs and the lung in dogs increases with increasing rib {{number in the}} cranial part of the rib cage and then decreases markedly in the caudal part. The hypothesis was raised that this non-uniformity is primarily related to differences between {{the areas of the}} lung subtended by the different ribs, and in the current study we tested this idea by assessing the effects of passive lung inflation. Thus, by causing a descent of the diaphragm, inflation would expand the area of the lung subtended by the caudal ribs and improve the coupling between these ribs and the lung. The axial <b>displacements</b> of the <b>ribs</b> and the changes in airway opening pressure (DeltaP(ao)) were measured in anaesthetized, pancuronium-treated, supine dogs while loads were applied in the cranial direction to individual rib pairs at functional residual capacity (FRC) and after passive inflation to 10 and 20 cm H(2) O transrespiratory pressure. In agreement with the hypothesis, inflation caused an increase in DeltaP(ao) for ribs 9 and 10. The most prominent alteration, however, was a marked decrease in DeltaP(ao) for ribs 2 - 8; at 20 cm H(2) O, DeltaP(ao) for these ribs was only 30 % of the value at FRC. Additional measurements indicated that this decrease in DeltaP(ao) results partly from the increase in diaphragmatic compliance but mostly from the reduction in outward <b>rib</b> <b>displacement.</b> This alteration in the pattern of rib motion should add to the decrease in muscle length to reduce the lung expanding action of the external intercostal muscles at high lung volumes.

40|$|The inspiratory {{intercostal}} muscles enhance the force {{generated by the}} diaphragm during lung expansion.

In the first experiment, external, cranially oriented forces were applied to the different rib pairs to assess the effect of diaphragmatic contraction on the coupling between the ribs and the lung. The fall in airway opening pressure (deltaPa(O)) produced by a given force on the ribs was invariably greater during phrenic nerve stimulation than with the diaphragm relaxed. The cranial <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> (Xr), however, was 40 - 50 % smaller, thus indicating {{that the increase in}} deltaPa(O) was exclusively the result of the increase in diaphragmatic elastance. In the second experiment, the parasternal intercostal muscle in the fourth interspace was selectively activated, and the effects of diaphragmatic contraction on the deltaPa(O) and Xr caused by parasternal activation were compared with those observed during the application of external loads on the ribs. Stimulating the phrenic nerves increased the deltaPa(O) and reduced the Xr produced by the parasternal intercostal, and the magnitudes of the changes were identical to those observed during external rib loading. It is concluded, therefore, that the diaphragm has no significant synergistic or antagonistic effect on the force developed by the parasternal intercostals during breathing. This lack of effect is probably related to the constraint imposed on intercostal muscle length by the ribs and sternum. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The bedside {{features}} of the cardiac apex impulse were studied in 50 patients and correlated with impulse recordings and angiographic determinations of left ventricular volume and mass. Left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed most accurately by {{the duration of the}} outward deflection of the impulse. Eighty-eight percent of the patients with a holosystolic impulse had an increased left ventricular mass, whereas 7 8 % of the patients with an early systolic impulse had normal left ventricular mass. An impulse occupying two or more rib interspaces also was associated with increased left ventricular mass. A normal chamber volume could be predicted if the impulse was palpated in only one <b>rib</b> interspace. <b>Displacement</b> to the left was less useful i...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{is used to}} dilate a too small or too narrow <b>rib</b> <b>thorax</b> in severe thoracic deformity. It consists of a telescopic [...] "titanium rib" [...] in curved form with several holes in a row for fixing in the desired length. A prolongation {{can be carried out}} after 6 months. The fixation takes place between two ribs or between a rib and the iliac crest. This results in an indirect erection of the deformed spine, resulting in an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity along with the lung.|$|R
50|$|The Idol is {{carved from}} larch. As {{identified}} from the annual rings, {{the tree was}} at least 159 years old. Stone tools were used for carving the markings. The head reproduces a face with eyes, nose, and mouth. The body is flat and rectangular. Geometrical motifs decorate its surface. Horizontal lines {{at the level of}} the <b>thorax</b> may represent <b>ribs,</b> and lines broken in chevrons cover the rest of the body. Along with the face at the top, several faces are visible at various points along the sculpture.|$|R
40|$|Many snakes, {{particularly}} cobras, form {{as part of}} {{a defensive}} display, a hood, an active lateral expansion of their neck skin and underlying musculature and ribs. We identified muscle groups possibly involved in hooding based on their attachments on the specialized ribs of the neck. We then used a combination of morphology, kinematic analysis, morphometrics, electromyography and muscle stimulation to test hypotheses about the functional basis of hooding. We confirmed that hood protraction and erection is an active process that begins cranially and extends caudally, often in stages, through the combined action of several sets of muscles. One set of axial muscles (levator costae and supracostalis lateralis superior) coursing along a line of action to <b>rib</b> <b>displacement</b> are the prime erectors acting to lift the hood. However, a second set of muscles connecting ribs to skin primarily keep the skin taut, rather than to displace the ribs relative to the vertebrae. A third set of muscles coursing between ribs function primarily to transmit forces between adjacent ribs rather than to move ribs. The maintenance of the erect hood requires continued muscle activity. Hood relaxation is due to both active muscle contraction of a fourth set of axial muscles and to passive recoil events in the costovertebral ligaments. The shape of the fully erect hood is reflective of the morphometrics of the underlying ribs, while the duration and kinematics of hood erection and relaxation are related to the behavioral context of the display.

40|$|Increasing {{instability}} {{of the knee}} developed in a 27 -year-old man who had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) approximately 10 years prior to surgical intervention. After initial conservative treatment, including use of a func-tional brace for activity, the patient opted for surgical reconstruction with a patellar tendon graft. One of the authors conducted three preoperative examinations to assess {{the condition of the}} patient’s musculoskeletal system. These manual examinations included findings of somatic dysfunction in the lumbo-pelvic region. In addi-tion, there was extension of muscular tension from the injured left knee and ankle into the lower <b>thorax</b> and <b>ribs</b> 6 through 9. During the postoperative rehabilitation pro-cess, examination at regular intervals included documen-tation of somatic dysfunction and osteopathic manipula-tive treatment (OMT). Following ACL reconstruction and OMT, the patient showed increasingly stable mobility in the lumbopelvic region. Furthermore, episodic new dys-functions readily resolved with OMT.

5000|$|According to a {{paper by}} Konno and Mead [...] “the chest can be looked upon as a system of two {{compartments}} with only one degree of freedom each”. Therefore, any volume change of the abdomen must be equal and opposite {{to that of the}} rib cage. The paper suggests that the volume change is close to being linearly related to changes in antero-posterior (front to back of body) diameter. When a known air volume is inhaled and measured with a spirometer, a volume-motion relationship can be established as the sum of the abdominal and <b>rib</b> cage <b>displacements.</b> Therefore, according to this theory, only changes in the antero-posterior diameter of the abdomen and the rib cage are needed to estimate changes in lung volume.|$|R
