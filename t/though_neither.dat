5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous cyst is a {{term used}} to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not {{originate}} in the sebaceous gland and so are not true sebaceous cysts. A true sebaceous cyst is relatively rare and is known as a steatocystoma.|$|E

Cayuga (435 feet deep, 133 m) and Seneca (618 feet, 188 m) Lakes are among the deepest in the United States, with bottoms well below sea level. They are also the longest Finger Lakes, <b>though</b> <b>neither's</b> width exceeds 3.5 miles (5.6 km); Seneca Lake is 38.1 mi long, and 66.9 mi2 km2, the largest in total area.|$|R

It was re-published with Poe's permission only twice during his lifetime; its subtitle was dropped for its final publication. Poe intended to include it in his collection Tales of the Folio Club or another called Phantasy Pieces, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> collection was ever produced.|$|E
5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|In 608, Heraclius the Elder renounced {{his loyalty}} to the Emperor Phocas, who had overthrown Maurice six years earlier. The rebels issued coins showing both Heraclii dressed as consuls, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> of them {{explicitly}} claimed the imperial title at this time. Heraclius's younger cousin Nicetas launched an overland invasion of Egypt; by 609, he had defeated Phocas's general Bonosus and secured the province. Meanwhile, the younger Heraclius sailed eastward with another force via Sicily and Cyprus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (<b>though</b> <b>neither</b> would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the dating {{of events in the}} life of Jesus, and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for only a few years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
5|$|A major {{branch of}} the Tsugaru clan was founded in 1656, which was first given hatamoto rank, before being {{promoted}} to daimyo status in 1809; this became the ruling family of the Kuroishi Domain, which immediately bordered its parent family's domain. A lesser branch was founded by Tsugaru Nobuzumi, {{the son of the}} first Kuroishi-Tsugaru family head; this branch remained hatamoto {{through the end of the}} Edo period. The main Tsugaru family's funerary temple in Hirosaki was located at Chōshō-ji. <b>Though</b> <b>neither</b> Tsugaru daimyo family ever held shogunate office, the Tsugaru of Hirosaki (together with many of the other domains of northern Honshū) assisted the shogunate in policing the frontier region of Ezochi (now Hokkaido). In the late Edo period, during the headship of Tsugaru Tsuguakira, the Hirosaki domain's forces were modernized along western lines.|$|E

5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Tales games, it features an action-based battle system, called the Three-Line Linear Motion Battle System. The game {{was developed by}} the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny. The scenario, written by Hiramatsu Masaki, dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and ethnic conflicts. The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600,000 units and the PSP re-release selling over 83,000. Western sites have been positive about the game, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> version of the game have received English localizations.|$|E
5|$|Both battleships were {{completed}} after Italy entered World War I {{on the side}} of the Triple Entente, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> saw action, since Italy's principal naval opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy, largely remained in port for the duration of the war. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E
5|$|Gellers was {{representing}} the Passamaquoddy pursuant to a 10% contingency fee agreement. Gellers, in turn, had assigned 40% of his fee to Bottomly. As the negotiations of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act were reaching a close in May 1978, even <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> Gellers nor Bottomly had performed any further {{work for the}} tribes, Bottomly filed suit in the District of Maine claiming he was entitled to a portion of any eventual settlement. On October 10, Judge Gignoux dismissed Bottomly's suit {{on the grounds of}} tribal sovereign immunity. When Bottomly's appeal came before the First Circuit in 1979, Maine filed an amicus brief arguing that the tribe was entitled to no such immunity. The First Circuit rejected this argument. A similar suit by Gellerswho had since been disbarred and changed his name to Tuvia Ben Shmuel Yosefwas thrown out in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Roma {{took part}} in a naval {{demonstration}} off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro. The following year, she was involved in a collision with the ironclad , <b>though</b> <b>neither</b> ship was damaged. That year, Venezia was converted into a torpedo training ship, while Roma remained in service until 1890, when she became a guard ship at La Spezia. In 1895, both ships were stricken from the naval register. Venezia was broken up for scrap the following year, but Roma was converted into a depot ship in La Spezia. On 28 July 1896, she was set on fire by a lightning strike and badly burned. The damage proved to be beyond economical repair, and so she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. <b>Though</b> <b>neither</b> woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
