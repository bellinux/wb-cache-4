6000|$|I {{have been}} lately {{to a little}} group of houses, not many enough {{to be called a}} village, in the barony of Kiltartan in County Galway, whose name, Ballylee, is known through all the west of Ireland. There is the old square castle, Ballylee, {{inhabited}} by a farmer and his wife, and a cottage where their daughter and their son-in-law live, and a little mill with an old miller, and old ash-trees throwing green shadows upon a little river and great stepping-stones. I went there two or three <b>times</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> to talk to the miller about Biddy Early, a wise woman that lived in Clare some years ago, and about her saying, [...] "There is a cure for all evil between the two mill-wheels of Ballylee," [...] and to find out from him or another whether she meant the moss between the running waters or some other herb. I have been there this summer, and I shall be there again before it is autumn, because Mary Hynes, a beautiful woman whose name is still a wonder by turf fires, died there sixty years ago; for our feet would linger where beauty has lived its life of sorrow to make us understand that it is not of the world. An old man brought me a little way from the mill and the castle, and down a long, narrow boreen that was nearly lost in brambles and sloe bushes, and he said, [...] "That is the little old foundation of the house, but the most of it is taken for building walls, and the goats have ate those bushes that are growing over it till they've got cranky, and they won't grow any more. They say she was the handsomest girl in Ireland, her skin was like dribbled snow"--he meant driven snow, perhaps,--"and she had blushes in her cheeks. She had five handsome brothers, but all are gone now!" [...] I talked to him about a poem in Irish, Raftery, a famous poet, made about her, and how it said, [...] "there is a strong cellar in Ballylee." [...] He said the strong cellar was the great hole where the river sank underground, and he brought me to a deep pool, where an otter hurried away under a grey boulder, and told me that many fish came up out of the dark water at early morning [...] "to taste the fresh water coming down from the hills." ...|$|E

Since 2000 there was an expansion from 76 MW to the actual 1908 MW, with an annual average increase of approximately 68 % last year. To reach the 39 % target set for the installed capacity from renewable sources until the year 2010, Portuguese plans, assumed by the governmental authorities and wind park investors, addresses until that year the installation of 3750 MW, multiplying the actual capacity, by approximately, two <b>times.</b> <b>Last</b> <b>year</b> wind energy has represented 6 % of the total energy produce in the country, and {{it is expected that}} in 2010 this value rise until 15 %.

40|$|This {{letter and}} {{enclosure}} are a follow {{up to the}} meeting held January 16, 2001 between the EPRI Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Working Group and the NRC staff to review subject report to seek the Commission's endorsement of the approach described. The enclosure is {{a copy of the}} report and we seek approval of the guidelines detailed in the topical report, per discussions at the meeting. In addition, we request that the fees for review be waived per the waiver criteria in Part 170, as explained below; following a discussion of the background behind the development of the revised guidelines. BACKGROUND EPRI prepared a set of guidelines for EMI testing in power plants and submitted it to the NRC in 1994. The NRC published an SER in response in 19961 which endorsed the approach but required the margins between equipment susceptibility limits and the highest plant emissions be increased, from 6 dB to 8 dB. EPRI published Rev 1 to the guidelines in 19972. EPRI reassembled the EMI Working Group in 2000 after being directed by the EPRI I&C Advisory Subcommittee to develop a revision to the existing EPRI EMI Guidelines, based on plant operating experience and guidance in Reg Guide 1. 180 issued by the NRC in January 20003 The Working Group, which consists of representatives of nuclear utilities, equipment vendors, and system integrators, met several <b>times</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> It was especially useful to the Working Group to have NRC staff present at all the meetings in 2000 durin...|$|E
