[...] He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on {{the movements of the}} planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. [...] However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, [...] "As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare <b>trouble</b> <b>you</b> to do me a favour in the... philosophical way." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{was a heavy}} smoker and drinker {{throughout}} his adult life, and suffered from heart disease. In 1961, aged 53, he {{suffered a heart attack}} and struggled to recuperate. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying [...] "I am sorry to <b>trouble</b> <b>you</b> chaps. I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." [...] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of <b>trouble.</b> <b>You</b> shout louder than you used to, and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} censorship. It uses the {{execution}} of Terrance and Phillip as the Seventh Sign in a parody of the Apocalypse. Cartman's use of foul language helps to avert the disaster. Parents and [...] "lazy child rearing" [...] come in for particularly sharp criticism. On their way to see Terrance and Phillip, the boys sing that [...] "movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!" [...] During [...] "Blame Canada" [...] a couple are seen abandoning their baby in their enthusiasm to join Mothers Against Canada. The song ends with: [...] "We must blame them and cause a fuss / Before somebody thinks of blaming us!" [...] Much of the film's satire and many of the songs are concerned with the refusal of people to accept responsibility for failure and their tendency to look for scapegoats (some of the songs are also parodies of musical theatre, but this is usually secondary to furthering the satire). Movies, government, society, foreigners and Satan are all blamed, leading Kyle to remark: [...] "whenever I get in <b>trouble,</b> <b>you</b> go off and blame everybody else. But I'm the one to blame. Deal with me." [...] The movie is also self-reflective in nature. The enthusiasm the kids display for seeing the Terrance and Phillip movie reflects the creators' anticipation of the real world enthusiasm many people, including those under age, would experience to see the movie.|$|E
500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007, that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organizers at the last minute. The executive producer of the 2007 VMAs Jesse Ignjatovic contacted Spears since she wanted to start the show in [...] "a very big and dramatic way", and was confident that Spears would deliver and set the tone for the rest of the night. She also said Spears was excited after she was approached by MTV to perform. On September 7, 2007, Spears started rehearsing at the Pearl Theater. An exclusive video from the rehearsal was posted on MTV.com the following day. The performance began with a close-up of the back of Spears's head, and continued with Spears turning to the camera and lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble": [...] "If you're lookin' for <b>trouble,</b> <b>you</b> came to the right place / If you're lookin' for trouble, look right in my face." [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The backdrop videos featured images of chandeliers floating and silhouettes of women, which were compared by Gil Kaufman of MTV to the gun barrel and title sequence of the James Bond series. At the end of the performance, Spears smiled and thanked the audience before leaving the stage.|$|E

2500|$|When {{you look}} through the {{financial}} history {{of most of the}} national festivals, the east coast has to subsidise events in Perth ... That's another reason why Big Day Out ticket prices were so high this year, because generally speaking you lose money in Perth. You've got two days to get there, three days to get back, all the trucking, all the production... a hotel room that you would pay $180 in Sydney is $320 a night in Perth in the same hotel chain. The price of hiring everything is ridiculous over there.

2500|$|The album {{opens and}} closes with two {{versions}} of the lead single, [...] "Trouble," [...] described by Sylvia Patterson of The Guardian as [...] "very London". Co-written with Sandé, it contains elements of trip hop and was inspired by Lewis' 2010 break-up with childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics co-written by Lewis include the lines [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of <b>trouble.</b> <b>You</b> shout louder than you used to and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] When Smith was brought on board, [...] "Trouble" [...] was one of the songs he worked on; a new rap verse by Childish Gambino was added along with some additional production. Early critics praised the song's emotive qualities and dark undertones.|$|E

He sent his subordinates to visit Taishi Ci's mother on multiple occasions and passed her many gifts. In the late 180s or early 190s, when Beihai came under attack by Yellow Turban rebels, Kong Rong led his troops to a fortress at Duchang (都昌; in present-day Weifang, Shandong).

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into <b>trouble,</b> <b>you</b> didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire {{can be an}} {{obstacle}} for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, [...] "If this absence of joy is going to <b>trouble</b> <b>you,</b> or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere." [...] However, for many fans, {{it is precisely this}} level of [...] "realness" [...] and [...] "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists–that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: [...] "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates." [...] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: [...] "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".|$|E
