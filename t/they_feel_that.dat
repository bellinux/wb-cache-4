Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes.

25|$|The superior–subordinate {{relationship}} {{is an important}} relational factor. Employees who perceive they have a higher-quality relationship with their supervisors are more often to use articulated dissent. They feel their supervisors respect their opinions {{and that they have}} mutual influence and persuasion over the outcome of organizational decisions. Conversely, employees that perceive their relationship with their supervisor as low-quality will resort to latent dissent. <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> there is no room to voice their opinions (Kassing, 2000).|$|E
25|$|People with OCD {{understand}} that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in compulsive hoarding might be inclined to treat inorganic matter {{as if it had}} the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate {{as to whether or not}} hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Retailers in Canada may refuse bank notes without {{breaking}} the law. According to legal guidelines, the method of payment has to be mutually agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 bank notes if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> would put them {{at risk of being}} counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.|$|E

25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In addition, in {{the recent}} decade a growing {{minority}} from within the Israeli Jewish conscripts have denounced the mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve (see also Refusal {{to serve in the}} Israeli military), many claiming that due to financial insecurities <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they need to be spending their time more productively pursuing their chosen studies or career paths. Some individual resentment may also be compounded by the typically low wages paid to conscripts—the current Israeli policies see National Service as a duty rendered to the country and its citizens, and therefore the Israeli army does not pay any wages to conscripts, but instead grants a low monthly allowance to the full-time national service personnel, {{depending on the type of}} their duty.|$|E
25|$|This battle {{would become}} {{extremely}} important to the Shi'i psyche. The Twelvers as well as Mustaali Ismāʿīlī still mourn this event during an occasion known as Ashura. The Nizari Ismāʿīlī, however, do not mourn this {{in the same way}} because of the belief that the light of the Imām never dies but rather passes on to the succeeding Imām, making mourning arbitrary. However, during commemoration they do not have any celebrations in Jamatkhana during Muharram and may have announcements or sessions regarding the tragic events of Karbala. Also individuals may observe Muharram {{in a wide variety of}} ways. This respect for Muharram does not include self-flagellation and beating because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> harming one's body is harming a gift from Allah.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades, the Republican Party has consistently won {{a majority of the}} LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E
25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|The Order of the Arrow Founder's Award {{was first}} {{introduced}} at the 1981 National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC), {{following the death of}} Goodman. This award honors Arrowmen in the Order of the Arrow (OA) for unselfish service above and beyond their normal duties to their lodge. Any lodge may present the award to up to two arrowmen annually; lodges with more than 1,000 members may present up to three awards, and lodges with more than 1,500 members may present up to four awards. No lodge may present more than four awards. If more than one Founder's Award is presented, at least one must be presented to a youth member under the age of 21. Lodges are not required to give the Founder's Award if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> no one is worthy of it. A member may only receive the award once in his or her lifetime.|$|E

50|$|If {{we try to}} {{find the}} reason for such conduct, we will have to {{conclude}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> instinctively <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> women are slaves, subservient to men and that they must be kept under control. That is why these people treat women like animals. <b>They</b> seem to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> giving freedom to women is equivalent to committing a very serious crime. The result of this attitude {{is that there is no}} independence or freedom to one half of the human race. This wicked enslavement of half of the human race is due to the fact that men are physically a little stronger than women. This principle applies to all spheres of life and the weaker are enslaved by the stronger.|$|R
25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E
