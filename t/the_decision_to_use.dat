5|$|On 13 April 2007, the Marine Corps {{announced}} the first V-22 combat deployment at Al Asad Airbase, Iraq. On 17 September 2007, 10 MV-22Bs of VMM-263 left for Iraq aboard USS Wasp. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a ship instead of self-deploying was made {{because of concerns}} over icing during the North Atlantic portion of the trip, lack of available KC-130s for mid-air refueling, and the Wasps availability.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> English-speaking actors {{was made}} early. Since the film {{would be very}} visual, the {{director}} wanted audiences {{to be able to}} focus on the images, and not have to rely on subtitles. He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non-English speaking countries.|$|E
5|$|After making <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a new {{character}} {{rather than}} Dizzy, Codemasters allowed Big Red Software free rein {{to develop the}} new game, only stipulating {{that it must be}} ready for release within 12weeks. By this point Big Red Software was already familiar with platform adventure games. The game retained the Dizzy graphic adventure title engine. Pete Ranson had previously designed graphics for every Dizzy game bar the first, graphics were shared between Dizzy games and some were also recycled for Seymour Goes to Hollywood.|$|E

The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes. Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training, causing some to vomit, which they saw as a bonding experience.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a {{straight}} or curved laryngoscope blade depends {{partly on the}} specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5â€“11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would go down {{as one of the}} greatest failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E
5|$|The Last Remnant {{was created}} by {{developers}} who had previously worked on games in the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. It was directed by Hiroshi Takai and produced by Nobuyuki Ueda. The game was written by Masato Yagi and Miwa Shoda whose work {{was based on a}} scenario concept by executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu. Kimihiko Miyamae was the chief artist, while Yusuke Naora served as both art producer and character designer. The game was the first game by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. Because they used a licensed engine rather than making their own, the production time it took to see graphical resources onscreen was cut significantly, allowing the team to begin illustrating and experimenting at an early stage. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a licensed engine, rather than develop their own as was traditional at Square Enix, was made due to concerns in the company of the rising production costs of making a game, and the direct development time savings possible from using an existing engine. Over a year after the game was released, on February 17, 2010, Square-Enix's chief technology officer Julien Merceron claimed in an interview that most of the game's perceived technical shortcomings were caused by a decision to use the Unreal Engine to try to replace having as many skilled programmers as would be used otherwise.|$|E
