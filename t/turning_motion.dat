25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a <b>turning</b> <b>motion,</b> a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E
50|$|First, {{there is}} no tail rotor, and the main rotors are contra-rotating. Yaw is {{controlled}} by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the rotor drive transmission. When one rotor is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (<b>turning</b> <b>motion).</b>|$|E
50|$|This is a legwhip where {{a wrestler}} grabs an opponent's leg {{and holds it}} {{parallel}} to the mat while they are facing each other. The attacking wrestler then spins the leg inwards causing the opponent to fall off balance and twist in the air bringing them {{to the ground in}} a <b>turning</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} solenoid {{actuator}} with a ferromagnetic plunger to generate both rectilinear and <b>turning</b> <b>motions</b> of a multi-segmented robot. Each {{segment of the}} miniaturized robot is actuated {{by a pair of}} solenoids, and in-phase and out-of-phase actuations of the solenoid pair cause the linear and <b>turning</b> <b>motions.</b> The theoretical analysis on the actuation force by the solenoid with the magnetic plunger is implemented based on the Biot-Savart law. The optimal design parameters of the solenoid are determined to actuate a segmented body. We manufacture the miniaturized robot consisting of two segments and a pair of solenoids. Experiments are performed to measure the linear and angular displacements of the two-segmented robot for various frictional conditions...|$|R
30|$|The {{previous}} subsections {{describe the}} simplified slip ratio and slip angle models for steady straight motion based on force interactions on a weak terrain. In this section, we introduce a slippage estimation method for a robot rotating on a slope. <b>Turning</b> <b>motions</b> are complex phenomena {{that can cause}} longitudinal and lateral slippage. Furthermore, the slippage may differ at various points on the track. For instance, the lateral slippage at {{the front edge of}} the track is larger than that at its middle. The force model of <b>turning</b> <b>motions</b> is complex and the accurate prediction of its behavior requires several parameters. Therefore, it is difficult to use the force model for a real unknown field. In this research, we introduce a slippage estimation method based on a non-force model during turning maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|The back kick, {{also known}} as the reverse side kick, {{involves}} the attacker originally facing his opponent. The attacker then turns 180 degrees so that his back is now facing the opponent and extends a leg backwards, exploiting the turning momentum to strike the opponent in the chest or stomach with the sole of his foot. A jumping back kick involves the attacker conducting the <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> as he jumps.|$|E
5000|$|In {{whiteout}} conditions, {{the brain}} is unable to determine orientation or movement accurately. The condition {{is caused by the}} rhythmic <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> of skiing and other effects such as a reduction in sensory feedback from constrained feet.In 1995 Rudolf Häusler of the University of Berne was the first described to suffer from this disease. [...] Ski sickness could affect up to 10% of skiers.Professor Häusler found that over-the-counter prescription medicines for motion sickness relieved the symptoms for most sufferers.|$|E
50|$|A carve turn is a skiing term, used {{to refer}} to a turning {{technique}} in which the ski shifts to {{one side or the other}} on its edges. When edged, the sidecut geometry causes the ski to bend into an arc, and the ski naturally follows this arc shape to produce a <b>turning</b> <b>motion.</b> The carve is very efficient and allows the skier to maintain their speed, unlike older techniques like the stem Christie and parallel turns based on stemming which can create significant drag.|$|E
40|$|As we know, a snake-like robot {{imitating the}} {{locomotion}} of real snakes can adapt to {{many kinds of}} environments. A successful collision-free behavior is necessary for adaptive locomotion of the snake-like robot. Many researchers have used Amplitude Modulation Method (AMM) to realize the <b>turn</b> <b>motion</b> of the snake robot. However, {{most of them are}} only qualitative studies without any concrete analysis of this method. For this reason, this research tries to solve these problems and give a computational model of Amplitude Modulation Method (AMM) for <b>turn</b> <b>motion.</b> Based on a head-navigated motion pattern, how to implement the proposed model for a collision-free behavior automatically is investigated. A simple simulation environment is constructed to verify the designed control strategy for this autonomous collision-free behavior of the snake-like robot.

50|$|Mercury clocks used a drum {{with several}} {{chambers}} that were connected through calibrated holes. A rope was wound around the drum with a weight connected to one end. The weight pulling down turned the drum, and the mercury in the drum chambers resisted the <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> by slowly flowing from one {{segment of the}} drum to the next, thus inhibiting {{the movement of the}} drum and making it turn at a more or less constant speed. The movement of the drum could be used to measure time.|$|E
50|$|A {{leadscrew}} (or lead screw), {{also known}} as a power screw or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and female members, screw threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, machine slides (such as in machine tools), vises, presses, and jacks.|$|E
50|$|In doing so, {{rotational}} {{speeds of}} up to 30.000 1/min can be reached, especially when processing thin wires. Depending on the winding diameter, wire speeds {{of up to}} 30 m/s are achieved during the winding process. The components to be wound are mounted on so-called winding devices. The winding devices are coupled to driven spindles that generate the <b>turning</b> <b>motion.</b> Since bringing the wire into the winding area should be done as evenly as possible, the rotational axis and the traversing axis operate synchronically during the winding process.|$|E

One possible explanation, presented by Steven Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rover Mission, was that the rover, in one of its <b>turning</b> <b>motions,</b> flicked the rock from a few meters away and into the new location.|$|R
40|$|A {{multiple}} model filter {{similar to}} the IMM filter is developed for tracking of maneuvering targets. The mode transition probabilities are modeled as dependent on the state. This allows using information about the mode of a target that is contained in the state. Thus, better estimates of the mode can be obtained. Convergence of the mode estimates occurs more quickly. As an application, choosing acceleration dependent mode transitions in a scenario using constant velocity <b>motion</b> and coordinated <b>turn</b> <b>motion</b> is discussed...|$|R

Micro also produced the Kickboard-like children's scooters as [...] "Mini Micro" [...] and [...] "Maxi Micro". The reverse design inherently provides greater stability than the standard: a standing person {{will tend to}} stand at the front of a scooter rather than at the back. However, the steering geometry is inherently weak and requires design adaptation to improve its response. An example is the Mini Micro, which uses a spring-loaded system to translate lateral force on the handbars (child leaning) into <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> on the wheels, referred by its makers as [...] "lean and steer".|$|E
5000|$|The 'modern' sawmill {{was invented}} or perfected by the Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon (1550-1607) who applied a pitman arm onto a wind mill, which {{converted}} a <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> into an up-an-down sawing motion. Cornelis {{took out a}} patent on his sawmill on December 15, 1593, and on the pitman arm device on December 6, 1597. Early sawmills adapted the [...] to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by the pitman arm or rod. A pitman {{is similar to a}} crankshaft, but in reverse (a crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion).|$|E
50|$|Also {{referred}} to as la casita or as bandito, this move's technical name is arm-wrench inside cradle pin and it is performed with the opponent {{on their hands and}} knees. From this position, the attacking wrestler stands next to the opponent's hip, grabs one arm and applies an armbar. The attacking wrestler then steps over the arm with his inside leg so that he is facing away from the opponent. The attacking wrestler continues his <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> and dives forward over the opponent, rolling onto their side. The barred arm acts as a lever, flipping the opponent over the attacker and onto his back. The attacker hooks one or both legs as the opponent goes over and holds for the pin.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth type of {{electric}} ice cream maker uses an outer tub filled with ice and salt for chilling. An inner canister holds {{the ice cream}} mixture and churn and scraper assembly. A high-speed electric motor, geared at approximately 75RPM, drives a mechanism that simultaneously rotates the canister, counter-rotates the scraper and holds the churn paddles stationary. As the canister turns, the ice cream mixture freezes against the inner wall of the canister. The counter-rotating scraper constantly removes the frozen product from the canister wall and returns it to the mixture. The continuing <b>turning</b> <b>motion</b> of the canister against the stationary churn paddles causes the mixture to become increasingly thick. Enough time, ice and salt produces a smooth [...] "hard packed" [...] ice cream.|$|E
