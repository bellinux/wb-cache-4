One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left.

He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them with us in our hearts".|$|E

2500|$|Anselmo {{started his}} own record label called Housecore Records {{sometime}} in 2001. The name derived from Anselmo's home being described {{as more of a}} [...] "hang out" [...] where many local friends and musicians would stay and record music together. Housecore also features in tattoo form on Anselmo's arm (Anselmo's told fans via live webcam that it was his first and favourite tattoo). Anselmo's primary objective is to release much older unreleased material and material from his many side projects. After gaining permission from Pantera's label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia band mate Killjoy's label, Baphomet Records. The newly named [...] "Baphomet/Housecore Records" [...] secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated [...] "What you're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> with Baphomet/Housecore, it's going to be different. It's going to be a fresh approach. It's {{going to be a lot}} of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done. Each band that I'm involved in outside of Pantera is a way for me to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part of me. With Pantera it's only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera's very important in my life, but there's many other things that keep this boy here content". After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo's label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting.|$|E
