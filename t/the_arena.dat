5|$|In 1918, Rosenthal {{was forced}} out by Dey in a complex scheme. Dey was negotiating, as owner of <b>The</b> <b>Arena,</b> with both Rosenthal {{on behalf of the}} Senators and Percy Quinn (who held an option to {{purchase}} the Quebec NHA club) on behalf of a proposed new professional league over exclusive rights to <b>the</b> <b>Arena</b> for professional hockey. In a plan to derail the proposed new league, Dey maintained publicly that he had reserved <b>the</b> <b>Arena</b> for Quinn's proposed league when, in fact, he had not cashed a cheque received from Quinn to reserve an option on <b>the</b> <b>Arena.</b> Rosenthal, believing the club could no longer play at <b>the</b> <b>Arena,</b> attempted to find alternate arrangements for the club, including refurbishing Aberdeen Pavilion, but was unsuccessful. Dey purchased Rosenthal's share of the club on October 28, 1918, and Rosenthal resigned from the club. Quinn filed a lawsuit against Dey for his deception but it was dismissed. Quinn would get further action from the NHL, as the NHL suspended Quinn's franchise and took over its players' contracts.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1918–19 season, {{ownership}} of the Senators changed.

However, {{it turned out that}} Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both <b>the</b> <b>Arena</b> and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL {{for the next five years}} and locking out any rival league from their arenas.|$|E
