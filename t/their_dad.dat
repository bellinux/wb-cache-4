5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while <b>their</b> <b>dad,</b> Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People {{come up to you}} in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because <b>their</b> <b>dad</b> was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
500|$|The {{brothers}} {{first became}} interested in wrestling in their youth by watching the World Wrestling Federation {{on one of the}} two channels their television could receive. Originally, they practiced wrestling moves with one another on a trampoline before the family built a wrestling ring in their backyard. From the beginning, the two of them worked on honing their craft, taping their moves and trying to improve them. Despite the fact that <b>their</b> <b>dad</b> was a coach for their high school's wrestling team, they did not participate in amateur wrestling in their high school years. Their first foray into professional wrestling came with the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA), while they were still in high school. While their mother, Jana, was in line to purchase tickets to attend a wrestling event, a promoter for the ECWA approached her and asked if her sons had a tape of themselves wrestling. This led to the brothers debuting for ECWA on May 20, 2000 under the ring names [...] "Jay and Mark Briscoe".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that <b>their</b> <b>dad</b> contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E

5000|$|The song is an anti-war ballad, {{about the}} {{conflict}} in Northern Ireland, The Troubles. Collins said, in an interview, [...] "It's about Northern Ireland as far as I am concerned.

You see newsreels of kids throwing petrol bombs because their brothers throw them and then <b>their</b> <b>dads</b> throw them and <b>their</b> <b>dad's</b> dad and it's just bred, inbred, now this violence and I just thought someone somewhere, and it's got to be from both sides, has got to say 'Hang on, life means more than this.

[...] Her parents’ mutual misery and depressingly gloomy lives were a “downer” she felt had no place in her fun city life.

Her parents, armed with a plethora of hobbies, a hot tub and a new philosophy, are not exactly the old folks she left behind. [...] Theresa needs a job, her parents need their space and a painful family history needs some closure. [...] Old wounds, unattainable dreams, and some “other things” are exposed as a fractured family works to become whole and a woman with a few kids learns to become a mother.|$|E

After Charlie compares his own situation to that of Einstein his father looks into information on the physicist and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother (JoBeth Williams) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up.|$|E

2500|$|Buffalo Bill and his Wild West {{was back}} in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam. [...] “At {{the opening of the}} 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer. [...] Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief Flying Hawk was in the party. [...] The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and swung open their richly covered blankets. [...] It was a {{surprise}} visit from old-time western friends. [...] Don [...] was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver same to the back door,to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside. [...] Don was thirteen, and full of business. [...] At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the platter, and another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes. [...] Don set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief. [...] As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket. [...] The boy was “game,” and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time.” “Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the [...] twins, aged five. More signals indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves. [...] But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. All smiles, the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout. [...] Dad called “time” and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience. [...] No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted. [...] When they were exhausted and <b>their</b> <b>dad</b> stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe as worthy of membership in [...] "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux." ...|$|E
