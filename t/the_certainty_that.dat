5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with <b>the</b> <b>certainty</b> <b>that</b> Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues.

Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford.

[...] Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard commented that [...] "there was some difference of opinion as to whether it was sound policy to execute spies and to begin with a patriotic spy like Lody." [...] According to Robert Jackson, the biographer of Lody's prosecutor Sir Archibald Bodkin, Lody's [...] "bearing and frankness when caught so impressed Britain's spy-catchers and prosecutors that they talked about trying to get the Government to waive the internationally recognised rule that spies caught in wartime automatically are put to death.
