5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
5|$|The account starts briskly; {{only four}} pages {{are devoted to}} Ralph's early life and a further {{fourteen}} to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions– 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay– are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed <b>themselves,</b> <b>what</b> they drink, the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to rely on their own resources. The {{second half of the}} novel is more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the album's creation each Weezer member asked <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> they {{wanted to get out of}} the album. With that in mind, they set out to record. Recording was done in three sessions. Half of the album was recorded during the spring of 2007 with Rick Rubin overseeing production. The second session, started in July and finished on October 18, was produced by Weezer themselves at Malibu. The third and final session of recording was done at the request of Geffen Records, who claimed that there was not enough commercial material on the album. This session was produced by Jacknife Lee and completed in March 2008.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> is just, but that only God decides what is good or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E

25|$|Peerage of Science is an {{independent}} service and a community where reviewer recruitment happens via Open Engagement: authors submit their manuscript to the service where it is made accessible for any non-affiliated scientist, and 'validated users' choose <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> they want to review. The motivation to participate as a peer reviewer comes from a reputation system where {{the quality of the}} reviewing work is judged and scored by other users, and contributes to user profiles. Peerage of Science does not charge any fees to scientists, and does not pay peer reviewers. Participating publishers however pay to use the service, gaining access to all ongoing processes and the opportunity to make publishing offers to the authors.|$|E
25|$|Marshall ran a congenial court; {{there was}} seldom any bickering. The Court met in Washington {{only two months}} a year, from the first Monday in February through {{the second or third}} week in March. Six months of the year the justices were doing circuit duty in the various states. Marshall was {{therefore}} based in Richmond, his hometown, for most of the year. When the Court was in session in Washington, the justices boarded together in the same rooming house, avoided outside socializing, and discussed each case intently among themselves. Decisions were quickly made usually in a matter of days. Marshall wrote nearly half the decisions during his 34 years in office. Lawyers appearing before the court, including the most brilliant in the United States, typically gave oral arguments and often did not present written briefs. The justices did not have clerks, so they listened closely to the oral arguments, and decided among <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> the decision should be. The court issued only one decision; the occasional dissenter usually did not issue a separate opinion.|$|E

500|$|Nojima has {{explained}} {{that the relationship between}} the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title is a dynamic he has always been concerned about. With VII, Cloud's subdued nature led him to write scenes with the character {{in such a way that}} the players would be placed in the position of deciding for <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> the character was thinking. Cloud's foggy memories served both to help players [...] "become" [...] the character, and to introduce them to a world which other inhabitants would otherwise share common knowledge of. Nomura believes that the reason Cloud has become so popular with audiences is due to the impact his personality made in Nojima's scenario.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} dated January 29, 1943 by SS-Sturmbannführer Bischoff to SS-Oberführer Hans Kammler, Bischoff refers to {{basement}} morgue 1 of Crematorium II at Auschwitz as a [...] "Vergasungskeller", literally [...] "gassing cellar". [...] In the letter, {{the word is}} underlined, {{and at the top}} of the document is written: [...] "SS-Untersturmführer Kirschnek!"

500|$|As {{promised by}} Grand Secretary Li Xian {{before the final}} assault on the Cao residence, {{imperial}} troops were allowed to confiscate for <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> they could find from Cao Qin's property. Li had also given another incentive that any imperial soldier who captured a rebel would be rewarded with the same title and office their captive had. Those found to be followers of Cao Qin were soon after executed, including members of the Imperial Guard and the Yuzhou Guard on August 22, 1461. On August 8, Cao Jixiang was publicly dismembered, a sentence and execution which ministers of state were made aware of by the Tianshun Emperor once he held an audience at the Median Gate. The dismembered corpses of Cao Qin and his brothers were left outside and exposed to the elements. Cao's father-in-law was spared from punishment since it was known that he had refused to communicate with Cao Qin during the latter's rise to power as a career general.|$|E
500|$|... "D'oh!" [...] {{was first}} added to The New Oxford Dictionary of English in 1998. It {{is defined as}} an interjection [...] "used to comment on an action {{perceived}} as foolish or stupid". In 2001, [...] "D'oh!" [...] {{was added to the}} Oxford English Dictionary, without the apostrophe ("Doh!"). The definition of the word is [...] "expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish". In 2006, [...] "D'oh!" [...] was placed in sixth position on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases. [...] "D'oh!" [...] is also included in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.

500|$|Before {{presenting}} Way of the Warrior to Mark Cerny of Universal Interactive Studios, Naughty Dog {{was signed}} on to the company for three additional games. In August 1994, Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin began their move from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles, California. Before leaving, Gavin and Rubin hired Dave Baggett, their first employee and a friend of Gavin's from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Baggett would not start working full-time until January 1995. During the trip, Gavin and Rubin studied arcade games intensely and noticed that racing, fighting and shooting games had begun making a transition into full 3D rendering. Sensing opportunity, they turned to their favorite video game genre, the character-based action-platform game, and asked <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> a three-dimensional version of such a game would be like. Because the player would be forced to constantly look at the character's rear, the hypothetical game was jokingly called [...] "Sonic's Ass Game". The basic technology for the game and the Crash Bandicoot series as a whole was created somewhere near Gary, Indiana. The rough game theory was designed near Colorado. Soon afterward, Gavin and Rubin threw out their previous game design for Al O. Saurus and Dinestein, a side-scrolling video game based on time travel and scientists genetically merged with dinosaurs.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because it gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> the answer would be.|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} the many {{differences between the}} prime and parallel universes in an interview, Pinkner explained that [...] "one of the big themes {{of the show is}} how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line". Pinkner {{and the rest of the}} Fringe production team loved the opportunity to build an entire new world, and asked <b>themselves</b> <b>what</b> life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. Pinkner elaborated in another interview that when the [...] "perfectionist" [...] crew were writing and constructing the parallel universe, they spent a lot of time on a high [...] "level of attention and detail" [...] that had all of the different departments and actors weighing in. Pinkner thought that because the parallel universe is effectively breaking down with [...] "World War II"-like conditions, these [...] "sort of tough times forge more noble, stronger people". To better differentiate the two universes, the producers changed the color of the opening credit sequences by making the parallel universe red and the prime universe blue. As with the opening credits in [...] "Peter", the episodes featuring the parallel universe displayed certain fringe science words in that world, including wormholes, speciation, pandemics, and telepathy.|$|E
