5|$|Felix Steiner {{published}} The Volunteers of Waffen-SS: Idea {{and sacrifice}} (German: Die Freiwilligen der Waffen-SS: Idee und Opfergang) in 1958. It presented the sacrifice messages echoing those of Der Freiwillige and stressed the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purely military Waffen-SS.|$|E
5|$|Hope remains Watts's {{best known}} work, and formed the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening {{ceremony}} of the 1998 Winter Paralympics in Nagano. In recognition of its continued significance, a major redevelopment of the Watts Gallery completed in 2011 {{was named the}} Hope Appeal.|$|E

5|$|A third <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work is {{the stress}} on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the title}} has {{religious}} connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an atheist {{he did not}} believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, this work—through the inevitable fate of the prey—seems to represent a nihilistic and hopeless view of the human condition. Bacon later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych Three Studies for a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Aquemini is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop duo Outkast. It was {{released}} on September 29, 1998, by LaFace Records. The title is a portmanteau of the two performers' Zodiac signs: Aquarius (Big Boi) and Gemini (André 3000), which {{is indicative of the}} album's recurring <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differing personalities of the two members. The group recorded the majority of the album in Bobby Brown's Bosstown Recording Studios and Doppler Studios, both in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation {{was made with}} the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Henry VI, {{the three}} parts {{considered}} {{together in one}} chapter, is not, for Hazlitt, on a level with the other history plays, but, in a long comparison of King Henry VI with King Richard II, he finds occasion to reinforce his major <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine discrimination of superficially similar characters.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits the <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blending of imagination and reality, {{as well as}} working in additional social themes. The series was created from an abundance of unused ideas for stories and arrangements that Kon felt were good but did not fit into any of his projects.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A. {{named the}} album after her mother, in {{contrast}} to her first album Arular, which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a major <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recording.

5|$|Mendelssohn {{wrote the}} concert Hebrides Overture (Fingal's Cave) in 1830, {{inspired}} by visits to Scotland {{around the end}} of the 1820s. He visited Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overture on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening.|$|E
5|$|Michael Weyland's {{ambiguous}} {{humanity is}} a subject of debate for viewers and critics, and speculation exists {{that he is an}} android more sophisticated than Bishop. In Cinema of Simulation: Hyperreal Hollywood in the Long 1990s, Randy Laist interprets this ambiguity as indicative of a <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alien franchise: what matters is a character's actions, not its species. Michael Weyland is a duplicitous character, and it is irrelevant whether he is a human or an android.|$|E
