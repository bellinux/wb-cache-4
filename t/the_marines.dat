Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before <b>the</b> <b>Marines</b> and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing <b>the</b> <b>Marines</b> back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E

Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach.

Oka's troops put heavy fire on <b>the</b> <b>Marines</b> at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. <b>The</b> <b>marines</b> hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons.

On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed.
