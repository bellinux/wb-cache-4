500|$|The Habakkuk Commentary (1QpHab) {{was one of}} the {{original}} seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 and published in 1951. The thirteen-column scroll is a pesher, or [...] "interpretation", of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk.</b> The Commentary on Psalm 37 is one of the three pesharim on the Book of Psalms and the only other Dead Sea scroll to use the sobriquet. Psalm 37 has been said to have [...] "the strongest literary and thematic links" [...] with the Book <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk,</b> compared to the other Psalms, and the language of Psalm 37 is borrowed by the Habakkuk pesherist in the commentary on Hab. 2:17. The similar language and <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> the Commentaries on Habakkuk and Psalm 37 have been suggested as evidence of common authorship, or at least similar interpretive methods.|$|R

50|$|A {{partial copy}} <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk</b> itself is {{included}} in the Habakkuk Commentary, a pesher found among the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947. The Commentary contains a copy of the first two chapters <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk,</b> but not <b>of</b> the third chapter. The writer of the pesher draws a comparison between the Babylonian invasion of the original text and the Roman threat of the writer's own period. What is even more significant than the commentary in the pesher is the quoted text <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk</b> itself. The divergences between the Hebrew text of the scroll and the standard Masoretic Text are startlingly minimal. The biggest differences are word order, small grammatical variations, addition or omission of conjunctions, and spelling variations, but these are small enough to not to damage the meaning of the text.|$|R

5000|$|Some medieval Muslim {{scholars}} even provided {{commentaries on}} the biblical Book <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk,</b> {{with the primary}} purpose of showing that the prophet had predicted the coming <b>of</b> Muhammad in <b>Habakkuk</b> 3:2-6, in a manner akin to the earlier Christian tradition of seeing in the book's prophecies allusions to the advent of Christ. For example, the medieval exegete Najm al-Dīn al-Ṭūfī (d. 716 AH/1316 CE) provided a commentary on select verses from the book <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk,</b> saying the prophet's words [...] "for his rays become light" [...] (Habakkuk 3:4) alluded to the spread of Islam; that his words [...] "his glory comes to town, his power appears in his courts" [...] (Habakkuk 3:4) referred to Muhammad's stay in the town of Yathrib and the help he received there from the ansar; and that his words [...] "death goes before him" [...] (Habakkuk 3:5) was a prophecy about the fear of the Muslim armies during the military campaigns of Muhammad and his companions. Likewise, Habakkuk 3:5-6 also received similar commentaries from medieval Islamic thinkers.|$|R

50|$|There are {{generally}} considered to be two types of pesharim. Continuous pesharim take a book of the Hebrew Bible, often from the prophets, such as those <b>of</b> <b>Habakkuk,</b> Nahum, or from the Psalms, quote it phrase by phrase, and after each quotation insert an interpretation. The second type, the thematic pesharim, use the same method, but here the author (or pesharist) brings together passages from different biblical texts to develop a <b>theme.</b> Examples <b>of</b> the latter include the Florilegium and what has been termed the Melchizedek Midrash. Smaller examples of pesher interpretations can also be found within other texts from Qumran, including the Damascus Document. The method has been likened to later forms of rabbinic biblical interpretation found in the Midrash, termed midrash aggadah and midrash halakhah, although there are some significant differences. William Brownlee, the author of a textual study <b>of</b> the <b>Habakkuk</b> Pesher, even proposed a third category of midrash, midrash pesher. In general, however, scholars are divided as to whether the pesharim are a distinct genre.|$|R
