30|$|A cloud {{environment}} involves {{two main}} entities: {{one is the}} service provider (i.e., the CSP) {{and the others are}} the service utilizers (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>CUs).</b> Both of these entities interact with each other using various tools and technologies (e.g., databases, networks, virtualization, operating systems, transaction management, resource scheduling, concurrency control, load balancing, and memory management). Not only <b>the</b> <b>CUs</b> utilize <b>the</b> services offered by the CSPs but also often outsource their sensitive data to the cloud servers. The use of various technologies {{and the fact that the}} customer’s data is not in-house bring numerous security challenges. Among those security challenges, encryption and data integrity is ranked as one of the top concerns of most of <b>the</b> <b>CUs</b> by <b>the</b> research community [5]. To address the issue of data integrity and confidentiality, the use of a trusted TPA has been proposed by several researchers [11, 18].

Therefore, there is clearly a need of a method that can be used to detect any malicious activities perform by the TPA.

Hence, we propose a CU early pruning algorithm that takes advantage of obtaining coding bits earlier to speed up the process of finding <b>the</b> best <b>CU</b> combination. HEVC uses essentially the same uniform reconstruction quantization scheme controlled by a quantization parameter (QP) as in H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC. The range of QP values is defined from 0 to 51, and an increase by 6 doubles the quantization step size such that the mapping of QP values to step sizes is approximately logarithmic. The QP values affect <b>the</b> number of <b>CU’s</b> total coding bits required, if the QP is larger, <b>the</b> <b>CU’s</b> total coding bits is smaller. The QP values in this paper are defined as 22, 27, 32, and 37 recommended by [37] to collect statistical data and test all sequences. We count the demand coding bits of different CUs sized 64 [*]×[*] 64, 32 [*]×[*] 32, and 16 [*]×[*] 16 under different quantization parameters (QP) derived through comparative analysis. By setting a certain coding bit threshold, we can obtain <b>the</b> best <b>CU</b> combinations more quickly than in HEVC.|$|R
