25|$|According to Klaas Schwartz, DWD is {{expected}} to monitor the quality of drinking water provided by NWSC. In practice, however, NWSC monitors its drinking water quality internally without any complementary external monitoring. NWSC's internal Quality Control Department examines whether the supplied water complies with <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> for drinking water, which in turn follow the World Health Organization guidelines. There are a central laboratory in Kampala and satellite laboratories in the other NWSC operation areas. At several sampling points, water is controlled for pH, color, turbidity, residue chlorine, and E. coli. The results {{are available at the}} official NWSC website and mostly comply with <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards.</b> Where NWSC does not provide the service, districts are responsible for water quality monitoring. According to the MWE, this is done insufficiently, and data are scarce.|$|E

In the current review, the overview of veterinary education in Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University (HBAU) was described, and some positive suggestions were provided about the veterinary clinical diagnostics course, which is an important compulsory course undertaken by undergraduate, based on <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standard</b> veterinarian qualification examination in China...|$|R

25|$|The {{justification}} Unicode gives is that <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> {{body in the}} PRC made unique codepoints for the two {{variations of}} the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate codepoints for the unique variants of 全. There is a reason for this {{that has nothing to}} do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process in the twentieth century that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of 全 with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.|$|E
25|$|The current {{version of}} {{standard}} CEN 1789 was published by the Comité Européen de Normalisation (European Committee on Standardization) on June 29, 2007. This replaced {{an early version of}} the standard, published in 2000. European standards are generally annotated by the organization, standard number and year of publication (e.g. CEN 1789:2000 or CEN 1789/2007). Within member countries, the annotation is likely to be adapted to include the local standards body, so that in Britain, the 'C' is dropped from the prefix, and replaced with 'BS', in Germany with 'DIN', and so on. Because of the likelihood of significant changes between versions, on the most {{current version of}} any standard should be used. The Comité Européen de Normalisation is an agency of the government of the European Union, with membership from <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> Body of each participating member country.|$|E
25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used in {{each country}} are set by {{national}} standards, {{some of which are}} listed in the IEC technical report TR 60083, Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. The IEC also maintains a Web page giving arbitrary letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs. The IEC Web page does not identify <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> corresponding to each plug letter. The letter codes are often used as a de facto naming standard when comparing different AC power plugs, especially when describing travel adaptors. Physically identical sockets may be connected to voltages incompatible with an appliance. The letter codes do not identify all the variants of a plug and socket family for different current ratings or for special purposes, and not all plug types have been assigned letters. Where an IEC letter code exists it is shown in this article.|$|E

25|$|The competition's first {{official}} full-length marathon was contested in 1964 {{and the change}} brought about improvements in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> as Lee Myeong-Jeong set a South Korea record to win in 1965 and Kim Bong-Nae became the first Korean to run under two hours twenty minutes a year later. At the 1970 edition, Canadian Ron Wallingford and two Japanese runners provided the race with its first international competitors. The quality of the field saw domestic runner Kim Cha-Wan react with a national record run of 2:17:34.4 to win the race. Kim improved his mark again in 1973 {{and went on to}} become the Dong-A Marathon's most prolific winner, scoring four victories in the 1970s. Japanese marathoner Toyoichi Masuda became the first foreign winner in 1977 and he was soon joined by his countryman Makoto Matsuzaki, who won two years afterwards. A women's 10km race was added to the programme in 1979 and Moon Ki-sook became the first women's Dong-A champion.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, decree nr. 252 of 13/25 July 1848, issued because “it has not [...] {{been agreed}} how <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> should be designed”, defined the flag as three {{vertical}} stripes, possibly {{influenced by the}} French model.

500|$|The first (and only) {{follow-up}} {{comparison of}} <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>standards</b> {{with the international}} prototype metre was carried out between 1921 and 1936, and indicated that {{the definition of the}} metre was preserved to within 0.2µm. During this follow-up comparison, {{the way in which the}} prototype metre should be measured was more clearly defined—the 1889 definition had defined the metre as being the length of the prototype at the temperature of melting ice, but in 1927 the 7thCGPM extended this definition to specify that the prototype metre shall be [...] "supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571mm from each other". [...] The choice of 571mm represents the Airy points of the prototype—the points at which the bending or droop of the bar is minimized.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{held the}} {{position}} of Director of Aeronautical Inspection throughout World WarII, his staff numbering more than 1,200 by 1945. A reorganisation of the directorate in 1940 had permitted qualified civilian engineers to be recruited for work that required increasing technical expertise, without them having to join the Air Force. In July the same year, Harrison proposed {{the construction of a}} series of test houses to help decentralise chemical, mechanical and metrological testing of materials used in the manufacture of munitions that previously had to go through either the Munitions Supply Laboratories or <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> Laboratory. The result was a major improvement in the speed of testing and, according to the official history of Australia in the war, [...] "a fuller use of the country's scientific and technical manpower". Harrison's daughter Greta joined the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, {{and by the end of}} the war was ranked flight officer.|$|E
