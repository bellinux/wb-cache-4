2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives.

2500|$|With the {{publication}} of his eighth novel White Noise in 1985, DeLillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist. White Noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the Award, he simply said, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't be here tonight, but I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> for coming," [...] and then sat down. The influence and impact of White Noise {{can be seen in the}} writing of such authors as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were [...] "All Souls", [...] "Ultrasonic", [...] "The American Book of the Dead", [...] "Psychic Data" [...] and [...] "Mein Kampf"; however, DeLillo acknowledged in a 2005 interview that White Noise was a fine choice, remarking [...] "Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E

[...] Jason Thompson's online appendix to [...] compares Togari to InuYasha in their shared theme of [...] "a villain gradually [...] into a good guy" [...] commenting that [...] "Togari makes a stronger than usual effort to show Tobe’s gradual socialization process." [...] Thompson also comments on the art [...] "while not nearly as scary as the premise suggests, is clean and chiseled, similar to Ryōji Minagawa." [...] In a series of reviews on Manga News, the manga's graphics is commended for its [...] "pure style with panels that are not overdone", commendation on the level of precision through explanation, with discrete action and advancing the plot through the use of intrigue.|$|E
