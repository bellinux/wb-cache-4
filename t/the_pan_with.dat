50|$|Wilderness {{areas can}} {{often have a}} burn-ban, prohibiting people from {{starting}} a fire. If a camper were {{to rely on the}} campfire method as their only source for cooking heat, they could find themselves in an unlucky situation. Cooking over a campfire can lead to pots and <b>pans</b> darkened <b>with</b> soot. Soot can be extremely difficult to remove and, if left on <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> can easily rub off onto clothing or the inside of the backpack. Campers have discovered methods of preventing this problem, such as coating <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> <b>with</b> cooking oil, to make the soot easier to remove.|$|R

6000|$|Selecting a {{spot where}} the white quartz was visible, Fleming {{attacked}} the bank with the pick. After one or two blows it began to yield and crumble away at his feet.

60|$|Setting {{down the}} tin pan {{of earth and}} water, the Yankee dipped both hands into it and stirred its {{contents}} about until it became liquid mud, removing the stones in the operation. It was then moved round quickly with a peculiar motion which caused some off the top to escape {{over the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> each revolution; more water was added from time to time, and the process continued until all the earthy matter was washed away, and nothing but a kind of black sand, in which the gold is usually contained, remained at the bottom.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile old Granny Fox {{had stolen}} out {{from around the}} corner of the shed behind Bowser. Getting hold of the edge of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> her teeth she pulled it back with her around the corner and out of sight. If she made any noise, Bowser didn't hear it. He was making too much noise himself and was too excited. Presently Reddy heard the sound of an opening door. Mrs. Brown was coming to see what all the fuss was about. Like a flash Reddy darted behind the barn, and all Mrs. Brown saw was Bowser tugging at his chain as he whined and yelped excitedly.|$|E
60|$|Entering {{one morning}} after the {{delivery}} of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk, Phil proceeded to the boys' hall, and took his seat {{at the end of}} the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty. Observing a very small telegraph-boy in a scullery off the hall, engaged in some mysterious operations with a large saucepan, from which volumes of steam proceeded, he went towards him. By that time Phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades, but this boy he had not previously met with. The lad was stooping over a sink, and carefully holding in the contents of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> its lid, while he strained off the boiling water.|$|E

Cut one up small and put it in <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> the meat. By the by, you had better tie a piece of cord to those four bears' hams, and let them tow overboard for two or three hours. The water must be quite salt now, and when you take them out we will rub a little fresh salt into them. They ought to keep well then." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Pompeii had no chimneys, because the climate {{there is so}} mild that they seldom needed a fire; {{and when they did}} need one, it was easier to make a small one in an open vessel, and let it stand {{in the middle of the}} room, or wherever it was required, than to make a chimney and a fireplace. The open pan in which the fires were made in those days stood on legs, and could be moved about any where. The fire was made of small twigs cut from the trees. The people would let the pan stand in the open air until the twigs were burnt to coal, and then they would carry <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> <b>with</b> the embers still glowing, into the room which they wished to warm, and place it wherever it was required.|$|E
60|$|By the women's wagon {{we found}} the liver cooked in its frying-pan, as the vrouw had said. Indeed, it was just done to a turn. Selecting a {{particularly}} massive slice, she proceeded to take it from <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> her fingers in order to set it upon a piece of tin, from which she had first removed the more evident traces of the morning meal with her constant companion, the ancient and unwashen vatdoek. As it chanced the effort was not very successful, since the boiling liver fat burnt the vrouw's fingers, causing her to drop it on the grass, and, I am sorry to add, to swear as well. Not to be defeated, however, having first sucked her fingers to ease their smart, she seized the sizzling liver with the vatdoek and deposited it upon the dirty tin.|$|E
60|$|The {{contents}} of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and finer, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick semi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand {{on the bottom of}} the pan. So thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of <b>the</b> <b>pan.</b> <b>With</b> a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of black sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.|$|E

50|$|Gold panning is {{a simple}} process. Once a {{suitable}} placer deposit is located, some alluvial deposit are scooped into a pan, where it is then gently agitated in water and the gold sinks {{to the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>pan.</b> Materials <b>with</b> a low specific gravity are allowed to spill out of <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> whereas materials <b>with</b> a higher specific gravity sink {{to the bottom of the}} sediment during agitation and remain within <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> for examination and collection by the prospector. These dense materials usually consist primarily of a black, magnetite sand with whatever stones or metal dust that may be found in the deposit that is used for source material.|$|R
60|$|While {{at anchor}} at this place, much ceremonious visiting and long {{conferences}} {{took place between}} the potentate of the islands and the partners of the company. Tamaahmaah came on board of the ship in royal style, in his double pirogue. He was between fifty and sixty years of age, above the middle size, large and well made, though somewhat corpulent. He was dressed in an old suit of regimentals, with a sword by his side, and seemed somewhat embarrassed by his magnificent attire. Three of his wives accompanied him. They were almost as tall, and quite as corpulent as himself; {{but by no means}} to be compared with him in grandeur of habiliments, wearing no other garb than <b>the</b> <b>pan.</b> <b>With</b> him, also, came his great favorite and confidential counseller, Kraimaker; who, from holding a post equivalent to that of prime minister, had been familiarly named Billy Pitt by the British visitors to the islands.|$|E
60|$|The washing had {{now become}} very fine--fine beyond all need of {{ordinary}} placer-mining. He worked the black sand, {{a small portion}} at a time, up the shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined sharply, so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip away. A golden speck, {{no larger than a}} pin-point, appeared on the rim, and by his manipulation of the riveter it returned {{to the bottom of the}} pan. And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another. Great was his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost. At last, of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all his labor, sent it flying out of <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> <b>with</b> one final swirl of water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. My story {{takes me}} {{straight}} {{into one of}} the rooms at St. Crux--a room about as long as your street here--so dreary, so dirty, and so dreadfully cold that I shiver at the bare recollection of it. Miss Garth was for getting out of it again as speedily as possible, and so was I. But the housekeeper declined to let us off without first looking at a singular piece of furniture, the only piece of furniture in the comfortless place. She called it a tripod, I think. (There is nothing to be alarmed at, Magdalen; I assure you there is nothing to be alarmed at!) At any rate, it was a strange, three-legged thing, which supported a great panful of charcoal ashes at the top. It was considered by all good judges (the housekeeper told us) a wonderful piece of chasing in metal; and she especially pointed out the beauty of some scroll-work running round the inside of <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> <b>with</b> Latin mottoes on it, signifying--I forget what. I felt not the slightest interest in the thing myself, but I looked close at the scroll-work to satisfy the housekeeper. To confess the truth, she was rather tiresome with her mechanically learned lecture on fine metal work; and, while she was talking, I found myself idly stirring the soft feathery white ashes backward and forward with my hand, pretending to listen, with my mind a hundred miles away from her. I don't know how long or how short a time I had been playing with the ashes, when my fingers suddenly encountered a piece of crumpled paper hidden deep among them. When I brought it to the surface, it proved to be a letter--a long letter full of cramped, close writing.--You have anticipated my story, Magdalen, before I can end it! You know as well as I do that the letter which my idle fingers found was the Secret Trust. Hold out your hand, my dear. I have got George's permission to show it to you, and there it is!" ...|$|E
