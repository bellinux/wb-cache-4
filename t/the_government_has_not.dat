5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the sluice gates. From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the sluice gates was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E

25|$|Fire safety {{experts said}} the tests the {{government}} is doing on cladding only are insufficient as the whole unit of cladding and insulation should be tested including fire stops. Fire safety experts maintain further that the tests lack transparency as <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> described what tests are being done.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{government}} has repeatedly and categorically denied that Falun Gong practitioners {{have been killed}} for their organs, and insists that it adheres to World Health Organization standards. However, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> refuted the specific points of evidence cited by researchers, nor provided an alternative explanation {{for the source of}} organs used in transplants.|$|E
25|$|In May 2001, the {{government}} {{decided not to}} approve the Falun Gong Preparatory Committee's application to register as a legal organisation. This action {{is believed to be}} more related to {{the government}}'s wish to improve relations with China rather than an attempt to undermine the Falun Gong in favour of Islam. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> prevented Falun Gong members from carrying out their activities in public.|$|E
25|$|In Turkmenistan, {{which does}} not receive as much foreign aid but has {{substantial}} natural gas reserves, the Soviet system of management has largely remained in place. Five separate ministries {{are in charge of}} specific segments of the transportation sector. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> developed any master plan on road improvements, so upgrades do not take into account traffic volume, future building or maintenance costs.|$|E
30|$|Thirdly, <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been {{equipped}} with the proper infrastructure to implement their policies, and {{they could not be}} able to help ‘settled pastoralists’ forever, as <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> also <b>not</b> been able to help millions of settled poor farmers. Unable to modernize the lives of these poor farmers, who have been settled thousands of years ago, it is surprising to design a pastoral policy whose aim and vision is to settle pastoralists.|$|R
50|$|On 26 March 2013, the {{opposition}} party {{backed out of the}} negotiation with <b>the</b> <b>government</b> over <b>the</b> upcoming 12 May election.

50|$|A government-established {{commission}} {{charged with}} recommending possible constitutional amendments concerning religious freedom completed its collection of public submissions {{at the end}} of 2010.

25|$|In several prisons, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{provided}} {{food for}} many years. Many prisoners starved to death; food remained inadequate and malnutrition widespread. In general, prisoners' {{families and friends}} were {{the only source of}} food and other necessities. Prisoners with no one to provide food were particularly at risk. Local NGOs reported that authorities sometimes moved prisoners without telling families, making the provision of food difficult or impossible. Prison staff often forced family members to pay bribes to bring food to prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Tourism is {{a growing}} {{industry}} in Pakistan. With more and more foreign investment and funding, Pakistan was able to build its major road and air networks to cater mass movements of cargo and inter-city travel. Roads are being developed by several consultants from the Northern Areas {{all the way down}} to the Port of Karachi. However, till this date, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> be able to take the tourism market seriously in Pakistan. The country is home to diverse tourist attractions which have not been funded or protected due to the government giving the tourism market a low priority.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of the European financial crisis, and continued latency in the Portuguese economy did not escape the election campaign. The unemployment rate in the Azores had grown to 15.6%, which was above the national rate (15.0%), and 5.9% greater than {{the same time in}} 2011. It was predicted that the unemployment rate would reach 16% by 2013. The region is heavily dependent on the public sector-driven economy, and <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> reduced, but actually hired more people to the Regional Secretaries (through public competition or through unemployment support programs). These activities have actually hidden the real increase in the unemployment rate, while measures to curtail the rise in public spending and implement austerity measures to reduce the debit did not occur.|$|E
50|$|Very little data {{on human}} {{trafficking}} in FSM is available as <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{made no effort}} to proactively identify victims despite its history as a source country for victims. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> conducted any inquiries, investigations, studies, or surveys on human trafficking.|$|R
50|$|Although draft {{legislation}} {{was published in}} 2005, as {{by the end of}} 2005 <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> set a date for discussion of the proposals in Parliament. As a result, it is unclear if the scheme will go ahead or when it would commence.|$|R
50|$|Judge Kleinfeld {{noted that}} the three pigeonholes (rational basis, {{intermediate}} and strict scrutiny) postdate the principles laid down by the Supreme Court governing this case. Unlike those {{cases in which the}} Supreme Court upheld restrictions on travel, in this case <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> offered a foreign policy or national security justification for <b>the</b> restriction, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> narrowly tailored <b>the</b> restriction to its purpose, and the apparent purpose of the restriction was to penalize past misconduct rather than to restrict travel as such. He then cited Socrates in Crito, the Magna Carta, Kent and the Jackson-Vanik amendment (the right to emigrate as “fundamental”) for the proposition that the right to leave is among the most important of all human rights.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{favorable}} laws, promising institutional arrangements, {{and external}} funding, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not,</b> on the whole, {{been effective in}} controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it {{can be attributed to}} the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.|$|E
500|$|... – The head of 1 Fürstentum Liechtenstein Television (1FLTV), Peter Kölbel, {{had said}} that {{due to a lack}} of {{financial}} subsidies from the Government of Liechtenstein, participation would be impossible until 2013 at the earliest. 1FLTV have been trying to join the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) since 2010, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> granted the nation's only channel the necessary subsidies. Kölbel stated that the country had a good chance of joining the contest in 2013, if funding was approved, but it was later announced that it would not be participating.|$|E
500|$|The last {{section is}} a {{proposed}} [...] section from Lysaker to Skøyen; the latter not being modified {{as part of}} the extension, since it was upgraded in 1999. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> set a date to start construction, but it will not be until at least 2020, since other projects will be prioritised over this section. No specific route has been finalised, and the project has been proposed to either run parallel to the current Drammen Line, or by placing all four tracks through a new tunnel. The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration, while the latter—which would cost NOK 1billion more—has been preferred by the municipality. There are no intermediate commuter stations between Skøyen and Lysaker, so there is little regularity or speed potential to gain from the construction, since the Oslo Tunnel from Skøyen to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks. Advocates have claimed that there is no gain from building this section without building two additional tracks {{all the way to the}} central station.|$|E
50|$|The Bill was 'fast-tracked' through parliament, {{with the}} {{consequence}} {{that it was}} not possible for the Joint Committee on Human Rights to scrutinise it.
