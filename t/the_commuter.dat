Transfer to railway services is available at Jernbanetorget (to Oslo S) and Nationaltheatret, the latter with a considerably shorter walk.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} to <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail platform was also temporarily {{out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>commuter</b> {{rail system}} serves 39 railway {{stations}}, {{most of which}} predate <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail service. When the Røros, Meråker and Nordland Lines were built, stations buildings were built at all places with a passing loop, {{and most of these}} stations the buildings remain, although they are not necessarily open to travelers. However, only Trondheim, Stjørdal, Steinkjer and Røros are manned. Several of the station and operation buildings along the line have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. These include the stations at Singsås, Hell, Skatval, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger. The system's depot is located at Marienborg, although trains also overnight at terminal stations.|$|E

40|$|Every {{commuter}} utilizing urban {{rail transit}} decides the departure time {{from home to}} a station according to individual judgment for the biggest possibility to board a train {{as soon as possible}} after the arrival. Therefore, the departure time choice behavior of <b>the</b> <b>commuters</b> is complicated especially when the transport capacity of this transit line cannot meet the travel demands of its users in rush hour. This research first develops a travel cost function mainly considering the travel time to rationally describe the volume distribution of <b>the</b> <b>commuters</b> arriving at a station at different time periods. Furthermore, an optimization model is accordingly proposed to rationalize the arrival distribution of <b>the</b> <b>commuters</b> on <b>the</b> basis of the amount of <b>the</b> arrived <b>commuters</b> who are able to board a train {{from the perspective of the}} systematic operation of a rail transit line for the minimal total travel cost of all <b>the</b> <b>commuters</b> along this line. It is found that the total travel cost can be reduced by 19. 0 % at most through the arrival distribution rationalization with the optimization model...|$|R

5|$|In March 2000, NSB {{announced}} that they were considering {{reducing the number of}} stations on <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20. NSB stated that 50% of the stations were responsible for only 2% of the traffic, and that a bus service to these areas—which would transport people to the closest railway station—would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers. NSB also stated that they indented to re-brand the service as part of the Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services. Part of the reason for the change of service was that Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers to the coach.|$|E
5|$|OsloS is {{the central}} hub of <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail. Located in the central {{business}} district of Oslo, all lines either terminate at, or run through the station.

Because there are more services in the latter three, some of these terminate at OsloS.|$|E

5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly.

In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if funding was not increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E

5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of <b>the</b> <b>commuter</b> rail.

An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a tram-train, which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
