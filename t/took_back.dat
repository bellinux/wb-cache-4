5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the urging of Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and <b>took</b> <b>back</b> control of Oreus.|$|E
5|$|David Reutimann won {{the pole}} position, and {{maintained}} his lead {{going into the}} first corner to begin the race, but Gordon took over the lead before the first lap was over. Afterward, Reutimann <b>took</b> <b>back</b> the lead, holding it until Matt Kenseth passed him on lap 47. Gordon led after the final pit stops. In the final laps, Johnson was gaining on Gordon, but Gordon maintained his position to win. There were six cautions and twenty-eight lead changes among thirteen different drivers during the race.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, the castle was held by William le Gros, the bishop of Winchester and {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he <b>took</b> <b>back</b> the castle and took steps to improve the condition of Southampton castle, as part of his attempt to improve the general standard of security in the south. At this time, Southampton was considered a key fortification, classed alongside other important castles such as the Tower of London, Windsor, Oxford, Lincoln and Winchester.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Wippleman was at ringside {{with the}} urn as the Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. The two wrestlers brawled, using the ring steps and steel chairs.

5|$|In 1189, Hugh {{was one of}} {{only five}} sitting sheriffs who {{retained}} their office when Richard took the throne; the others included Geoffrey fitzPeter, William Briwerre, and Ranulf de Glanvill. However, in 1189, Bardulf did lose custody of Salisbury Castle, which he had held under Henry. Henry had given Bardulf the manor and barony of Brampton in Devonshire, but when Richard took the throne, the king <b>took</b> <b>back</b> Brampton, and gave Bardulf the manor of Hoo in Kent instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, the club's NHL {{franchise}} {{was transferred}} to St. Louis, although the Association continued its ownership of the franchise and player contracts {{as well as the}} senior club.

Under the agreement, the NHL paid for the players and <b>took</b> <b>back</b> possession of the franchise. If the franchise was resold, the proceeds would go to the Ottawa Hockey Association.|$|E

In 1812, the British merged Demerara and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. Stabroek, as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812. The colonial powers appointed a governor to rule in their stead, and the local legislation was decided on by a Court of Policy.|$|E

5|$|After Æthelstan's death, {{the men of}} York {{immediately}} {{chose the}} Viking king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson (or his cousin, Anlaf Cuaran), as their king, and Anglo-Saxon control of the north, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed. The reigns of Æthelstan's half-brothers Edmund (939–946) and Eadred (946–955) were largely devoted to regaining control. Olaf seized the east midlands, leading {{to the establishment of}} a frontier at Watling Street. In 941 Olaf died, and Edmund <b>took</b> <b>back</b> control of the east midlands, and then York in 944. Following Edmund's death York again switched back to Viking control, and it was only when the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo-Saxon control of the whole of England was finally restored.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni <b>took</b> <b>back</b> the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg <b>took</b> <b>back</b> third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, Southampton was held by William le Gros, the Bishop of Winchester and a {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he <b>took</b> <b>back</b> Southampton and carried out improvements to the castle, as part of his attempt to improve the general standard of security in the south. By {{the second half of the}} 12th century, Southampton was increasingly important for coastal defence and as a base for operations on the continent. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, but no efforts were undertaken to improve the town's ditches and banks.|$|E
5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert <b>took</b> <b>back</b> the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E
