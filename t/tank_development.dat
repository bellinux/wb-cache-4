25|$|British combat {{experience}} in the North African campaign identified several shortcomings of the M3 Stuart light tank, especially the performance of its 37mm cannon. A 75mm gun was experimentally fitted to an Howitzer Motor Carriage M8 - an M3 tank with a larger turret - and trials indicated that a 75mm gun on the M5 light <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> of the M3 was possible. The M3/M5 design was dated though, the 75mm gun reduced storage space, and the armor was insufficient.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union during World War II, the German armed forces were not aware of two newly developed Soviet tanks, the T-34 and the KV. As a result, they were surprised when they met them in combat {{for the first time in}} June 1941. The Germans' standard anti-tank weapons were found to be ineffective against these new Soviet vehicles. This experience prompted a notable leap in <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> in Nazi Germany, mainly in an effort to counter these new threats.|$|E
25|$|Guderian had pioneered {{motorized}} {{tactics in}} the pre-war army, while keeping himself well informed about <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> in other armies. In particular, he promoted {{the use of}} radio communication between tank-crews, and devised shock-tactics that proved highly effective. In 1940, he led the Panzers that broke the French defences at Sedan, France, leading to the surrender of France. In 1941, his attack on Moscow was delayed by orders from Hitler with whom he disagreed sharply. Soon, the Germans found themselves suffering from severely cold weather. This perhaps led to the German defeat at Moscow. After the German defeat at the Battle of Moscow he {{was transferred to the}} reserve. This marked the end of his ascendancy.|$|E

50|$|A rift formed between France and West Germany {{following}} Charles de Gaulle's {{decision that}} France {{would no longer}} participate in NATO, with West Germany opposing a standardised common tank project. In 1963, both West Germany and France declared that they would produce purely national <b>tanks.</b> <b>Development</b> towards main battle tank projects such as the AMX-30 occurred soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 2008, Gen. Dalip Bhardwaj, the Indian Army's Director General of Mechanized forces (DGMF), {{declared}} that the army had rejected Tank Ex.

25|$|A {{sense of}} {{complacency}} fell upon {{those in charge}} of developing tanks in the U.S. Army because the M4 Sherman, in 1942, was considered by the Americans to be superior to the most common German tanks: the Panzer III and early models of the Panzer IV. Even through most of 1943, the 75-mm M4 Sherman was adequate against the majority of German armor, although the widespread appearance of the German 7.5 cm KwK 40 tank gun during this time had led to a growing awareness that the M4 was becoming outgunned. There was insufficient Intelligence data processing and forward thinking {{to understand that there}} was an ongoing arms race in tanks and that the U.S. needed to anticipate future German tank threats. The Tiger I and Panther tanks that appeared in 1943 were seen in only very limited numbers by U.S. forces and hence were not considered as major threats. The end result was that, in 1943, the Ordnance Department lacking any guidance {{from the rest of the}} army, concentrated its efforts in <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> mainly on its major project, the electrical transmission T23. By contrast, the Russians and British were engaged in a continuous effort to improve tanks; in 1943, the British begin development of what became the 51-ton Centurion tank (although this tank would reach service just too late to see combat in World War II) and, on the Eastern Front, a full-blown tank arms race was underway, with the Soviets responding to the German heavy tanks by starting development work on the T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks.|$|E
500|$|The Defense Act of 1920 had defined {{tanks to}} be used in support of the infantry. Through the 1920s a number of theorists {{outlined}} an independent role for the tank that required it to move at high speed into the rear areas, a modern version of the cavalry. The British referred to these designs as cruiser tanks, but similar high-speed designs were developed under a variety of names. As the Defense Act limited <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> to the infantry, the United States Cavalry began <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> under the name [...] "combat car". In keeping with the high-speed role, the new T5 Combat Car introduced the new vertical volute spring suspension (VVSS) system, which proved clearly superior to the Vickers leaf spring system.|$|E
500|$|The British War Office {{carried out}} a {{rudimentary}} trial with a Holt tractor. [...] Several key figures in <b>tank</b> <b>development,</b> including J.B.E. Estienne and Joseph Vollmer, were influenced by Holt tractors and [...] investigated the possibilities of tracked fighting vehicles. [...] They decided not to pursue production of the Holt design and instead independently developed the first British tanks. [...] The French also purchased Holts from the USA and used them {{as the basis for}} their own early tanks, the Schneider and Saint-Chamond. Later in the War, Holt tractors commandeered by the Austro-Hungarian army and loaned to the Germans formed the basis of the German A7V tank.|$|E

500|$|The Leopard 1 and the AMX-30 {{originated}} from a joint <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> program {{known as the}} Europanzer. [...] For a tank, the AMX-30 had a low silhouette; {{the height of the}} tank was 2.28meters (7.48ft), compared to the Leopard's 2.6meters (8.53ft). [...] In terms of lethality, the AMX-30's Obus G high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round {{was one of the most}} advanced projectiles at the time. [...] Because HEAT warheads become less efficient during spin stabilization induced by the rifling of a tank-gun barrel, the Obus G was designed so that the shaped charge warhead was mounted on ball bearings within an outer casing, allowing the round to be spin stabilized through the rifling of the gun without affecting the warhead inside. [...] The Obus G was designed to penetrate up to 400millimeters (15.75in) of steel armor. [...] On the other hand, the Leopard was armed with the L7A3 tank gun, capable of penetrating the frontal armor of most contemporary tanks. [...] Although the Leopard boasted greater armor than the AMX-30—partially accounting for the weight difference between the two tanks—the latter was sold at a cheaper price.|$|E
2500|$|McNair {{established}} [...] "battle need" [...] {{criteria for}} {{acquisition of weapons}} {{in order to make}} best use of America's [...] supply line to Europe by preventing the introduction of weapons that would prove unnecessary, extravagant or unreliable on the battlefield. In his view, the introduction of a new heavy tank had problems in terms of transportation, supply, service, and reliability, and was not necessary in 1943 or early 1944. <b>Tank</b> <b>development</b> took time, and so the sudden appearance of a new tank threat could not be met quickly enough under such criteria.|$|E
2500|$|Development of {{the first}} Japanese-designed tank began in June 1925. The {{original}} plan was for two types of tanks to be created. A light tank at 10-ton based on the French Renault FT tank and a 20-ton design modeled after the British Vickers medium tank. A team of four engineers in the motorcar group of the Technical Bureau participated {{in the development of}} the medium tank, including a young army officer, Major Tomio Hara. Major Hara later became the head of the <b>tank</b> <b>development</b> department and would rise to the rank of General.

2500|$|Even {{before the}} loss of the {{majority}} of the United Kingdom's tank force in France in 1940 after Dunkirk, it was recognised that tank production in the UK at the start of the war was insufficient and capacity in the US was taken for British needs. [...] So it was necessary that if Canada was to equip with tanks they would have to be manufactured locally. In June 1940 the Canadian Pacific Railway's Angus Shops in Montreal, as the only large firm with spare capacity, had received a contract to produce 300 partially fitted out Valentine tanks for the British; this was followed later with one for 488 complete tanks for Canada. [...] However the Valentine was an infantry tank and Canada required a cruiser tank for its recently formed armoured division. In the end 1,420 Valentines were produced by CPR, most of which were supplied to the USSR. Although the Valentine used a number of American produced parts, its reliance on British components, difficulties in adapting its manufacture to North American methods, and other problems such as limitations to the availability of the right type of armour plate affected Valentine production. The Canadian Joint Committee on <b>Tank</b> <b>Development</b> concluded, in September 1940, that its cruiser tank should be based on a US rather than a British design. This would be quicker and allow it to use components already in production for the US design.|$|E
2500|$|Yet whilst {{equipment}} was lacking and outdated, Italian authorities were {{acutely aware of}} the need to maintain a modern army and were taking the necessary steps to modernize in accordance with their very own relatively advanced tactical principles. Almost 40% of the 1939 budget was allocated to military spending. Awareness existed, albeit belatedly, of the need to have close air support for the Navy and the decision to build carriers was taken And whilst the majority of {{equipment was}} obsolescent and poor, appropriate steps were being taken whereby quality equipment was being developed. For example, the three series 5 fighters were capable of meeting the best allied fighters on equal terms, but only a few hundred of each were produced; The [...] Fiat G55 Centauro received much German interest and was defined by Oberst Petersen, advisor to Goering, as the [...] "best Axis fighter." [...] The Carro Armato P40 tank, roughly equivalent to the M4 Sherman and Panzer IV, was designed in 1940, but no prototype was produced until 1942 and developers/manufacturers not able to roll out any of these tanks before Armistice. This was owing, in part, to the lack of sufficiently powerful engines, which were themselves undergoing a development push. Unlike the Allies, Italian tank designers did not think to use old aircraft engines, which were available in relative abundance, and would have certainly facilitated more rapid <b>tank</b> <b>development.</b> Total tank production for the war (≈3,500) was less than the number of tanks used by Germany in its invasion of France. The Italians were also reported {{to be the first to}} use self-propelled guns, both in close support and anti-tank roles, and their, for example, 75/46 (& 75/32), 90/53 (a peer of the German 88/55), 102/35 and 47/32 mm, and 20 mm AA guns were not obsolete. Also of note were the AB 41 and the Camionetta AS 42 which were regarded as excellent vehicles of their type. None of these developments precluded the fact that the bulk of the equipment was obsolescent and poor. However, it was this relatively weak economy, lack of suitable raw materials and inability to produce suitable quantities of armaments and supplies which was predominant reason for Italian military failure.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Nivelle Offensive, Schneider {{understood}} that more capable designs had to be manufactured if the tank were to remain a viable weapon system. On 1 May 1917 it discussed a range of possible options, numbered one to five. All had in common that basically the same mechanical components were used as with the Schneider CA, though often improved, and that the suspension was only partially changed: elongated by the addition of an eighth road wheel and using thirty-five instead of thirty-three wider, forty-five centimetres broad, track links. However, all were also strongly modernised: the hull overhang had disappeared, the hull front formed as a sloped wedge, and the inner space was compartmentalised, with an engine room, protruding behind the sprocket, at the back and the driver in front. The armour base was about sixteen to twenty millimetres. The first two proposals were probably identical to the April 1917 projects and discarded by the company as inferior. [...] The last three, favoured by Schneider itself, were all turreted vehicles: design No 3 had a 47mm gun in the hull and a single machine-gun turret; No 4 differed in having two machine-gun turrets and No 5 in having the gun moved to a turret. [...] During discussions about these proposals, Estienne pointed out that the intended long 47mm gun had not entered production yet and that no high performance explosive charge was available to give it a sufficient effect on soft targets. [...] Therefore, he insisted on fitting the standard 75mm field gun, even if this would raise weight to 14.5 tonnes. A week later Schneider presented proposal No 6, which envisaged a vehicle weighing fourteen tonnes and having a shortened 75mm gun in the turret. [...] On 5 July 1917 drawings were ready of the type, which was now called the Schneider CA3. [...] However, these included an alternative version with a shortened 75mm gun in the hull. Estienne had misgivings about this project, questioning its trench-crossing capacity and predicting engine power would be insufficient, given a weight that had by now reached 16.6 tonnes. Also he demanded a gun sight allowing some fire-on-the-move capability. [...] Nevertheless, on 24 July the Consultative Committee of the Artillerie Spéciale decided that the four hundred vehicles of the Schneider Modèle 1917 ordered on 10 May 1917, were to be of the CA3 type. These had to be delivered from May 1918 onwards. A prototype was ordered of each version — the mechanical parts in May and the armour hulls in July — but the company itself limited its construction activities to the one with the gun in the hull, probably because a cannon turret was judged to be [...] "absurd" [...] given the lack of enemy tanks and a machine gun turret was seen as necessary for close defence against infantry assault. [...] Later that year, in an official answer to an inquiry by parliamentarian Paul Doumer regarding the progress achieved within French <b>tank</b> <b>development,</b> the designation [...] "Schneider CA4" [...] is used to indicate a design studied {{within the context of a}} larger order for two prototypes, weighing twenty tonnes and fitted with a cannon turret armed with the shortened 75mm gun, and of which Schneider is unable to predict when the single prototype to be constructed would be finished, though deliveries could start in April 1918. [...] A mock-up was built of the Schneider CA3, and on 24 October the chassis was tested at SOMUA. During the summer however, Estienne and Pétain had become worried that the medium tank production might become an obstacle to the planned light tank mass production of the Renault FT. On 27 October the committee advised that the construction of the Schneider CA3 would be suspended in favour of light tank production. [...] It argued that the type could probably not be delivered before August 1918 anyway, too late for the summer offensives of that year, and that an improved medium tank design should be taken into development instead. The ultimate decision not to produce the Schneider CA3 was only taken in February 1918. [...] On 19 January 1918 it was proposed that the preproduced CA3 components would be used to construct a further two hundred Schneider artillery tractors. [...] On 3 November 1917 the order for the Schneider CA4 prototype was annulled. [...] The new medium tank project had already been started on 15 August 1917 and strived for a technically advanced seventeen tonne vehicle armed with a shortened 75mm gun and benefiting from a much improved mobility. [...] It remained a paper project.|$|E

6000|$|This logical {{development}} of the Tank idea may seem a gloomy prospect for mankind. But it is open to question whether the tremendous {{development of}} warfare that has gone on {{in the last two}} years does after all open a prospect of unmitigated gloom. There has been a good deal of cheap and despondent sneering recently at the phrase, [...] "The war that will end war." [...] It is still possible to maintain that that may be a correct description of this war. It has to be remembered that war, as the aeroplane and the Tank have made it, has already become an impossible luxury for any barbaric or uncivilised people. War on the grade that has been achieved on the Somme predicates an immense industrialism behind it. Of all the States in the world only four can certainly be said to be fully capable of sustaining war at the level to which it has now been brought upon the western front. These are Britain, France, Germany, and the United States of America. Less certainly equal to the effort are Italy, Japan, Russia, and Austria. These eight powers are the only powers capable of warfare under modern conditions. Five are already Allies and one is incurably pacific. There is no other power or people in the world that can go to war now without the consent and connivance of these great powers. If we consider their alliances, we may count it that the matter rests now between two groups of Allies and one neutral power. So that while on the one hand the development of modern warfare of which the Tank is the present symbol opens a prospect of limitless senseless destruction, it opens on the other hand a prospect of organised world control. This <b>Tank</b> <b>development</b> must ultimately bring the need of a real permanent settlement within the compass of the meanest of diplomatic intelligences. A peace that will restore competitive armaments has now become a less desirable prospect for everyone than a continuation of the war. Things were bad enough before, when the land forces were still in a primitive phase of infantry, cavalry and artillery, and when the only real race to develop monsters and destructors was for sea power. But the race for sea power before 1914 was mere child's play to the breeding of engineering monstrosities for land warfare that must now follow any indeterminate peace settlement. I am no blind believer in the wisdom of mankind, but I cannot believe that men are so insensate and headstrong as to miss the plain omens of the present situation.|$|E
