25|$|First quarter {{consisted}} of a five-yard quarterback draw by Steve McNair which made the score 7–0. Early {{in the second quarter}}, Clarence Moore caught a short four-yard pass in the endzone to make it 14–0. About 6 minutes later, Ronnie Prude intercepted Drew Brees for a 12-yard interception return. Later on, Drew Brees passed to Joe Horn for a 32-yard touchdown pass to make it 21–7. Late in the second quarter tight end Todd Heap was passed a ball <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> Baltimore touchdown to make it 28–7 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|One {{complication}} was {{the tidal}} {{flow in the}} English Channel, where high water moves from west to east, with high water at Lyme Regis occurring around six hours before it reaches Dover. If all the landings were to be made at high water across a broad front, {{they would have to}} be made at different times along different parts of the coast, with the landings in Dover being made six hours after any landings in Dorset and thus losing the element of surprise. If the landings were to be made at the same time, methods would have to be devised to disembark men, vehicles and supplies at all states of the tide. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> reason to favour landing craft.|$|E

25|$|Harvick {{would have}} a {{substandard}} Chase run. He fell to sixth place in the point standings, until he finished third at Texas. Following <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> dominating performance in the Checker Auto Parts 500 at Phoenix International Raceway on November 12. Harvick would win that race, moving him up to third in points. At the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Harvick would finish fifth in the race and slip to fourth in the final standings to eventual 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson. In the Busch Series, Harvick would be scheduled to run all 35 races, with three different cars (#21, No. 33, #29) and two different teams, Richard Childress Racing and his own team, Kevin Harvick Incorporated. Harvick had 9 wins, 23 Top 5's, and 32 Top 10's. He clinched the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series championship on October 13, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in the Dollar General 300. It was the earliest clinch of the championship ever in the Busch Series, locking up the title with four races to go. He ended {{the season with a}} record 824-point margin in the final standings.|$|E
25|$|To bolster his own new regime, Benito Mussolini {{was also}} eager for an agreement. After years of negotiation, in 1929, the Pope {{supervised}} {{the signing of}} the Lateran Treaties with the Italian government. According to the terms of the treaty {{that was one of the}} agreed documents, Vatican City was given sovereignty as an independent nation in return for the Vatican relinquishing its claim to the former territories of the Papal States. Pius XI thus became a head of state (albeit the smallest state in the world), the first Pope who could be termed a head of state since the Papal States fell after the unification of Italy in the 19th century. The concordat <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> of the agreed documents of 1929 recognised Catholicism as the sole religion of the state (as it already was under Italian law, while other religions were tolerated), paid salaries to priests and bishops, gave civil recognition to church marriages (previously couples had to have a civil ceremony), and brought religious instruction into the public schools. In turn, the bishops swore allegiance to the Italian state, which had a veto power over their selection. The Church was not officially obligated its support the Fascist regime; the strong differences remained, but the seething hostility ended. The Church especially endorsed foreign policies, such as support for the anti-Communist side in the Spanish Civil War, and support for the conquest of Ethiopia. Friction continued over the Catholic Action youth network, which Mussolini wanted to merge into his Fascist youth group.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Nathanson {{met with}} Spielberg and Lucas in August 2004, {{and turned in}} the next drafts in October and November 2005, titled The Atomic Ants. David Koepp {{continued}} on from there, giving his script the subtitle Destroyer of Worlds, based on the J. Robert Oppenheimer quote. It was changed to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, as Spielberg found it more inviting a title and actually named the plot device of the crystal skulls. Lucas insisted on the Kingdom part. Koepp's [...] "bright [...] idea" [...] was Indiana Jones and the Son of Indiana Jones, and Spielberg had also considered having the title name the aliens as The Mysterians, but dropped that when he remembered <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> film's title. Koepp collaborated with Raiders of the Lost Ark screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan on the film's [...] "love dialogue." ...|$|E

500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had to start all over again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I did when I was mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E
