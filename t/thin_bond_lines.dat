40|$|The load {{capacity}} of long adhesive lap joints is often governed by stress concentrations at the lap ends. This paper investigates {{a method to}} minimize these stress concentrations by using a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength, here denoted as a resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> The resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> is intended to increase the load carrying capacity of long lap joints by achieving a more uniform shear stress distribution while maintaining an elastic joint behaviour without damage or plastic deformation. The study comprises analytical, numerical and full-sized experimental work on double lap joints with lengths 200 – 700 mm comparing conventional stiff <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> to resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> Different resilient <b>bonds</b> <b>lines</b> were obtained by using rubber-like adhesives and by having a rubber mat within the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> An analytical definition of a ‘long’ lap joint is suggested and a study of adhesive-rubber bonding is also presented. The numerical analysis clearly indicates that an increase in load carrying capacity is made possible using resilient <b>bond</b> <b>lines.</b> A good agreement is also found between the numerical results and the analytical Volkersen theory, indicating that reasonable strength predictions {{can be obtained by}} hand calculations if the joint is designed in order to minimize the influence of peel stress. The experimental results of the resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> verify the numerical findings, although production difficulties decrease the statistical significance of the result. On the contrary, the experimental results of the conventional <b>bond</b> <b>lines</b> significantly exceeded the numerical predictions, showing similar load carrying capacities to the resilient <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> This is probably due to the specific boundary conditions used in the test setup. Despite some contradictory experimental results, the conclusion {{of this study is that}} the efficiency of long lap joints can be increased by the use of a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with low shear stiffness and sufficient strength...|$|R

The stress intensity factor (SIF) for cracked thin film has been obtained as a function of elastic mismatch between the substrate and the film.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel plate joints can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber foil interlayer in adhesive joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative rubber foil adhesive joint. The glued wood-to-steel plate joints studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the <b>bond</b> <b>line.</b> In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> it was found that <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement.

Such applications are often characterised by relatively thick, 0. 5 mm or more, adhesive joints and by a possible variability of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness associated with large-scale structures manufactured in boatyard environment. Experimental and numerical analysis in the case of shear tests are proposed to study the influence of <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the adhesive. In order to accurately analyse the complete non-linear behaviour of an adhesive in an assembly, specimens with low edge effects have to be used. An increase in the thickness of the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> leads to an increase in the influence of the edge effects, computed under elastic assumption. As those numerical results are not able to completely analyse all the experimental observations, various 2 D simulations, with refined meshes, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive are proposed to complete the analysis. Even for bonded assemblies with low edge effects, computed under elastic assumptions, the analysis of the stress distribution throughout the thickness of the joint, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the adhesive underlines that an increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>line</b> thickness leads to an increase in equivalent plastic deformation close to the free edges.
