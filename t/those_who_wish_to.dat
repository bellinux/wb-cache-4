Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet {{is supported by the}} devoutly religious, Islamists, and by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E

5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{described}} as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation).

Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. Although she has very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E
