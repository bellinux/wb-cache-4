Starting with ballistic deposits of varying density, we investigate how the porosity of the compacted sample depends on the cohesion strength and the friction coefficients. This allows to explain different pore stabilization mechanisms. The final porosity depends on the cohesion force scaled by the external pressure and on the lateral distance between branches of the ballistic deposit r_capt. Even if cohesion is switched off, pores can be stabilized by Coulomb friction alone. This effect is weak for round particles, {{as long as the}} friction coefficient is smaller than 1.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine the implications of this taper for the function of collagen fibrils. When a tissue is subjected to low mechanical forces, stress will be transferred to the fibrils elastically. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> was <b>modelled</b> <b>using</b> finite element analysis because there is no analytical theory for elastic stress transfer to a non-cylindrical fibril. When the tissue is subjected to higher mechanical forces, stress will be transferred plastically. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> was <b>modelled</b> analytically. For both elastic and plastic stress transfer, a paraboloidal taper leads to a more uniform distribution of axial tensile stress along the fibril than would be generated if it were cylindrical. The tapered fibril requires half the volume of collagen than a cylindrical fibril of the same length and the stress is shared more evenly along its length. It is also less likely to fracture than a cylindrical fibril of the same length in a tissue subjected to the same mechanical force...|$|R

This indicates that star formation in these systems was a globally coordinated event which occurred over a time span less than or comparable to the collapse time scale of the cluster. This issue is addressed by assuming that the fragmentation of a proto-globular cluster cloud proceeded in two steps.

The challenge is for hybrid derivatives to escape the homogenizing eects of gene flow from parental species. The mechanisms hypothesized to underlie <b>this</b> <b>process</b> were <b>modelled</b> <b>using</b> a computer simulation. The model is of recombinational speciation, in which chromosomal rearrangements between parental species result in poor fertility of F 1 hybrids, but through recombination, novel homozygous types are formed that have restored fertility. In simulations, stable populations bearing the recombinant karyotypes originated frequently and were maintained when the fertility of F 1 hybrids was high. However, this high rate of origination was oset by low genetic isolation, and lower F 1 hybrid fertility increased the evolutionary independence of derived populations. In addition, simulations showed that ecological and spatial isolation were required to achieve substantial reproductive isolation of incipient species. In the model, the opportunity for ecological isolation arose {{as a result of}} adaptation to extreme habitats not occupied by parental species, and any form of spatial isolation (e. g. founder events) contributed to genetic isolation.

The yeast monoculture is O[subscript 2] limited and the presence of algae in the culture would result in better resource utilization. Next, an algal/fungal raceway pond with a feed of cellulosic glucose is explored. Finally, an oleaginous yeast that can consume a glucose/xylose mix, resulting from the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic waste, is modeled. This model predicts biomass and lipids productivities comparable to those reported in the literature. Assuming 50 % yield loss due to contamination and invasion, a simple economic analysis shows that an algae/yeast coculture can produce biodiesel at competitive prices, $ 2. 01 per liter for pure glucose and $ 1. 44 per liter for the sugar mix, whereas the algae monoculture can do so only at very short distances from a flue gas source.

The contribution of different pores with different radii is taken into account using an effectiveness factor presented for each pore radius.

The input of freshwater to the ocean provides a source of buoyancy and drives convective motion alongside the ice–ocean interface. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> is <b>modeled</b> <b>using</b> the theory of buoyant plumes that has previously been applied {{to the study of}} the larger-scale circulation beneath ice shelves. The plume grows through entrainment of ocean waters, and the heat brought into the plume as a result drives melting at the ice–ocean interface. The equations are nondimensionalized by using scales appropriate for the region where the subglacial drainage, rather than the subsequent addition of meltwater, supplies the majority of the buoyancy forcing. It is found that the melt rate within this region can be approximated reasonably well by a function that is linear in ocean temperature, has a cube root dependence on the flux of subglacial meltwater, and has a complex dependency on the slope of the ice–ocean interface. The <b>model</b> is <b>used</b> to investigate variability in melting induced by changes in both ocean temperature and subglacial discharge for a number of realistic examples of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers.
