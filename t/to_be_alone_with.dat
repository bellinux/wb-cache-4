Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg {{the use of}} his car, to return unused decorating {{materials}} to Guildford and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper (Roger Griffiths) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party.

5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, {{were in the same}} room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E

Yang becomes the maid of honor and Meredith serves as Alex's best man. Back at the hospital, Izzie is sad about her hair loss but Alex tells her she doesn't need it to be beautiful. The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as she wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her husband.|$|E

500|$|Aware that a regency was {{becoming}} increasingly unlikely, Conroy and the Duchess began promoting {{the view of}} Victoria as a [...] "weak-minded, frivolous and foolish" [...] girl in need of guidance.

Victoria was forbidden <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her beloved Lehzen; either the Duchess's ally Lady Flora Hastings or a Conroy sister (now appointed as companions) were required to accompany her.|$|E

Charlie meets Darryl after she comes to ask him to keep his surf gang under control. During an interview with Digital Spy, Peacocke was asked if Darryl likes Charlie romantically and he said, [...] "For a bloke like Brax, Charlie is pretty ideal – she's smart, sexy and is strong enough to take him on. He's all about testing himself and he knows he'll be running a gauntlet if he pursues her. She's got that X-factor he can't ignore." [...] When a fight breaks out at the Surf Club, Charlie arrives to investigate and she asks Darryl to step outside, so they can talk. Darryl misinterprets the situation and believes Charlie just wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him, he then kisses her. Charlie is [...] "horrified" [...] and she arrests Darryl for assaulting a police officer. Peacocke revealed that after the arrest, [...] "things will develop dangerously" [...] between Charlie and Darryl and that it will be [...] "tense to watch!" [...] Charlie is put under pressure from the community to find a more serious crime with which to charge Darryl and his gang. She believes that he is selling stolen alcohol to Angelo, but everything checks out and Darryl come to the belief that the kiss has [...] "sparked something in Charlie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contemplative {{prayer is}} a silent attentiveness which looks at God by contemplating and adoring his attributes. St. Teresa {{describes}} Contemplative prayer [...] as [...] "...nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him who we know loves us.” In this inner prayer {{we can still}} meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. Contemplation, like all prayer, is pure gift, and not anything one can achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Teresa {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences. Her deep insight and analytical gifts helped her to explain them clearly. Her definition was used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: [...] "Contemplative prayer [...] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him who we know loves us." [...] She used a metaphor of mystic prayer as watering a garden throughout her writings.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened so he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, he visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation. Lauren Abramson, an attorney with the firm, said she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by Ferguson. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I did not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{witness to}} appear for the prosecution, {{forensic}} psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz {{testified that he}} did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect {{at the time that he}} committed the crimes, stating: [...] "Dahmer went to great lengths <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> his victim and to have no witnesses." [...] He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive. Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice, he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: [...] "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He had to drink alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do." [...] Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both Return of the Jedi and The Exorcist III; particularly the level of [...] power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer would occasionally view scenes from these films before searching for a victim. Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Martland, wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Johanna, sends Mortdecai to America to {{meet with}} Milton Krampf, a {{potential}} buyer for the Goya. Mortdecai plans to sell his [...] beloved Rolls-Royce to the American, and uses {{the opportunity to see}} if Krampf is involved with the theft. Arriving in Los Angeles, he discovers that the Goya has been hidden in the Rolls. Spinoza, in the employ of Krampf, stashed it there after stealing it from Strago, the original thief; Krampf planned to dupe Mortdecai into smuggling the Goya into the United States in his own car. He invites Mortdecai to a party that night, where Krampf intends to display the ill-gotten painting. Jock suggests that he and Mortdecai steal the painting for themselves during the party. Krampf's daughter, Georgina, is secretly Strago's partner. She attempts to seduce Mortdecai while Strago steals the painting. Johanna arrives with Martland and catches her husband in a compromising position. Mortdecai flees the scene to help Jock steal the painting, but they find Krampf has been murdered by Strago and the painting is gone. Martland and Johanna capture Strago, but Georgina gets the drop on them, liberating her lover and the painting. Pursued by Mortdecai, Jock, Martland and Johanna, they hide in a motel where Strago intentionally sets fire to the Goya and the fire causes the explosion of the building. Johanna reveals that the painting was a fake; The Duke has the real one hidden.|$|E
2500|$|The 1993 {{arrival of}} Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) {{prompted}} the reveal that, {{prior to the}} series' debut, Erica had been raped at age 14 by Eric's friend, film star Richard Fields. Eric had allowed Richard, who had a [...] "crush" [...] on Erica, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her and had done nothing to prevent the rape from occurring. A revisitation of the event during Erica's 2004 alcohol intervention storyline introduced the fact Eric had actually offered up Erica for sex with Richard to convince the actor to star in one of Eric's films. Erica represses all memory of the rape until 16-year-old Kendall, a child conceived by it and revealed to be Erica’s first born daughter she gave up for adoption to the Harts, appears in 1993. Viewer reaction to the discrepancy created by Erica's having a 16-year-old daughter conceived in a 24-year-old rape prompted the series to immediately adjust Kendall's age to 23. The mother-daughter relationship between Erica and Kendall was designed as antagonistic and complex, with Kendall, unaware of the rape, seeking revenge against Erica in feeling she [...] "abandoned" [...] her as an infant, while wanting her mother's approval. Kendall's attempted seduction of Erica's love interest, Dimitri Marick, creates conflict between him and Erica, and Kendall also brings Richard Fields to town to torment her mother. Kendall later makes peace {{with her mother and}} leaves town in 1995. She returns in 2002, portrayed by a new actress, Alicia Minshew, as Kendall's birth year was revised to 1976. The later story between Erica and Kendall displayed each character's point of view as they both deal with the ramifications of how Kendall's conception traumatized them, which Lucci praised. A reconciliation later occurs for the characters wherein they bond as mother and daughter.|$|E
