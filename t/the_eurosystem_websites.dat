40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the choice between}} inflation targeting and monetary targeting as a strategy for <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem,</b> <b>the</b> actual strategy <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> announced in <b>the</b> fall of 1998, the framework for policy decisions appropriate for achieving the goals of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem,</b> <b>the</b> role of exchange rate management in the EMU, and the accountability and transparency of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem.</b> <b>The</b> choice between inflation targeting and monetary targeting is, in effect, a choice {{between high and low}} transparency. Inflation targeting and monetary targeting, in practice, imply similar policy decisions, but monetary targeting implies that policy decisions are explained in terms of money-growth developments that are not essential for policy. <b>The</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> has specified an operational inflation target, although in a somewhat ambiguous way. More importantly, its announced monetary strategy is deficient, since it proposes a prominent role for an essentially irrelevant money-growth indicator in analysis and communication, but will keep secret the inflation forecast that will, in practice, be the decisive input in policy decisions. Exchange rate policy is controlled by the Council of finance ministers in the EMU; this is a major inconsistency in the Maastricht Treaty and a possible threat to the independence of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem.</b> <b>The</b> European Parliament may have a crucial role in ensuring the accountability of the Eurosystem; the minimum transparency needed for effective outside monitoring and evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem's</b> policy decisions seem to require published inflation forecasts and, most likely, published minutes and voting records of the Governing Council. ...|$|R
30|$|As {{regards the}} {{security}} layers, {{on the one}} hand, Fig.  6 shows that the largest fraction of securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem,</b> amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, were issued by General Governments, followed by debt securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> (1.13 trillion euros), Rest of the World (1.06 trillion euros), and Other Financial Institutions (1.00 trillion euros). Non-financial Corporations and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds play only a minor role as issuing counterparties of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem.</b> <b>The</b> fact that General Governments {{play a key role}} as an issuing counterparty of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> could be explained as follows. The expectation of the public security purchases by <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> and <b>the</b> subsequent increase in the prices of the purchased securities may have generated an increase in the purchases of public securities by the private banking sector in order to sell them to <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem.</b> However, our data, being data on holdings and issuances, are not able to provide empirical evidence of the aforementioned speculation. On the other hand, with particular reference to the APP securities, as we can see from Fig.  7, {{at the end of the}} second quarter of 2017, the largest fraction of APP securities held by <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> was issued by the institutional sector General Governments, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, followed by securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> (0.31 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.04 trillion euros). In fact, the majority of purchases carried out by <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> within <b>the</b> APP until now have been public sector security purchases (European Central Bank 2017 a).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{implications}} of the euro for the international reserves in <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem.</b> Two conceptually different effects of the changeover have to be distinguished: a technical effect that largely arises as a matter of accounting, and a behavioural effect that {{stems from the fact that}} the optimal demand of <b>the</b> aggregate <b>Eurosystem</b> is not equal to the sum of the optimal country levels. The technical effect arises from two main sources: the abolishment of the ECU-creating mechanism, and the redefinition of international reserves which precludes (former) reserves that were denominated in euro-currencies. As a result the average reserves of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> in 1999 amounted to $ 287 billion, considerably less than in 1998 ($ 345 billion). We then derive a reserve demand function for <b>the</b> aggregate <b>Eurosystem</b> using panel data estimation techniques and simulate reserve demand for the situation after the regime shift. The optimal aggregate level of reserves turns out to be some $ 188 billion, which implies excess reserves in <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> amounting to approximately $ 100 billion in the year 1999. We go on by proposing a key by which this excess could be allocated to the individual countries taking the asymmetric distribution of reserves in <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> into account. Finally we classify and enumerate the proposals for making use of the estimated reserve overhang. (author's abstract) Series: EI Working Papers / Europainstitu...|$|R

40|$|A {{reform of}} <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem’s</b> {{inferior}} monetary-policy strategy is increasingly urgent, {{as noted by}} a number of observers. For instance, a recent extensive CEPR report finds the that the prominent first pillar of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem’s</b> strategy, <b>the</b> money-growth indicator, “looks increasingly ridiculous, giving perverse signals that the ECB probably ignores”, and that it is “flawed beyond repair–both as a matter of theory and empirically. ” <b>The</b> <b>Eurosystem’s</b> definition of price stability is ambiguous and asymmetric, and less effective as an anchor for inflation expectations than a point inflation target. <b>The</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> should simply adopt the superior monetary-policy strategy of flexible inflation targeting that Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Sveriges Riksbank follow. That is, it should announce a symmetric inflation target, demolish the first pillar, use all relevant information (including any useful information in monetary aggregates) in the construction of published inflation and output-gap forecasts, set interest rates so these forecasts are consistent with the inflation target and modest output-gap variability, and motivate its interest decisions with reference to these forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Most outsiders tend to {{base their}} {{analysis}} {{of the future of}} <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> on <b>the</b> shape of the Federal Reserve System in the US. This paper argues that the US model is inappropriate. It suggests that <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> is pursuing a different arrangement, where {{the balance of power in}} the national central banks rather than in the centre may continue, particularly as the EU expands. This structure affects the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy, the one wielded tightly by the ECB and the other by national governments subject to the Stability and Growth pact. The paper explores how <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> is developing <b>the</b> process of co-ordination between itself and the fiscal authorities. It concludes that this is pushing <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> towards increasing transparency in order to make its case. This process is simultaneously easing the relationship between the ECB and the European Parliament and between the NCBs and their governments and parliaments.

Although decisions regarding monetary policy are made centrally by the Governing Council of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem,</b> <b>the</b> operational aspects of monetary policy-including open market operations, administration of the minimum reserve system, and management of the standing facilities-are undertaken in a decentralized fashion at the twelve national central banks.

40|$|In {{the past}} few months, euro area money markets {{have been exposed to}} intense tensions. On 8 August, {{overnight}} interest rates rose to very high levels which required interventions of <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> in order to stabilise short-term money market interest rates around the target level, i. e. the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations. The article explains how <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> steers very short-term money market interest rates by adjusting its supply of liquidity on the money market. It is shown how <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem’s</b> liquidity management stabilised short-term money market interest rates around the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations {{in the first half of}} 2007. Although short-term money market interest rates were more volatile during the period of financial turmoil, <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> nevertheless managed to safeguard the signalling function of the short-term money market interest rates by applying its operational framework in a flexible way. More specifically, <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> decided to allot more liquidity than the benchmark amount in the main refinancing operations early within the maintenance period. It was also decided to conduct fine-tuning operations on a more frequent basis in order to stabilise short-term rates. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> also decided to increase the share of longer-term refinancing operations in the total amount of outstanding open market operations. Despite the relative success in stabilising very short-term money market interest rates, longer maturity unsecured interest rates – for instance the 3 -month Euribor – increased significantly during the period of financial turmoil. These movements cannot be controlled directly by central banks as they are determined predominantly by private sector behaviour. However, when assessing the appropriate monetary policy stance, the Governing Council of the ECB takes these possibly changing financing conditions into account. monetary policy implementation, Eurosystem, open market operations...|$|R

40|$|In March, <b>the</b> <b>Eurosystem</b> {{started to}} {{purchase}} on the secondary market euro- denominated bonds issued by governments, agencies and European institutions.
