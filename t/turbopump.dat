5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer <b>turbopump</b> (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer <b>turbopump</b> (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|Block II (RS-25D) – First flown on STS-104, the Block II upgrade {{included}} {{all of the}} Block IIA improvements plus a new high pressure fuel <b>turbopump.</b> This model was ground-tested to 111% FPL {{in the event of}} a contingency abort, and certified for 109% FPL for use during an intact abort.|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer <b>turbopump</b> (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{oxygen and}} low-pressure fuel <b>turbopumps</b> were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} low-pressure <b>turbopumps</b> to the high-pressure <b>turbopumps</b> contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure <b>turbopumps</b> to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|R
50|$|Columbia was {{initially}} scheduled to launch in late February. However, this date slipped to early March due to concerns with the tip-seal retainers {{in the main}} engines' oxidizer <b>turbopumps.</b> All three <b>turbopumps</b> were replaced at the pad but later inspection revealed the retainers {{to be in good}} condition.|$|R

5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the sustainer <b>turbopump.</b> Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer <b>turbopump</b> to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E
25|$|Because Mercury-Redstone had larger {{propellant}} tanks {{than the}} Redstone missile, an additional nitrogen bottle was added for tank pressurization, {{and an extra}} hydrogen peroxide tank for powering the <b>turbopump</b> due to the longer burn time.|$|E
25|$|There {{is no way}} to {{directly}} measure thrust of a rocket in flight; Rather, a mathematical calculation is made from combustion chamber pressure, <b>turbopump</b> speed, calculated propellant density and flow rate, nozzle design, and atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|Staged {{combustion}} designs can {{be either}} single-shaft or twin-shaft. In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant <b>turbopumps.</b> Examples include the Energomash RD-180 and the Blue Origin BE-4. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant <b>turbopumps</b> are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners. Examples of twin-shaft designs include the Rocketdyne RS-25, the JAXA LE-7, and the Raptor. Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional set of preburner and turbine, but allows for individual control of the two <b>turbopumps.</b>|$|R
40|$|As novelty {{detection}} {{works when}} only normal data are available, {{it is of}} considerable promise for health monitoring in cases lacking fault samples and prior knowledge. In this paper, two novelty detection methods are presented for health monitoring of <b>turbopumps</b> in large-scale liquid-propellant rocket engines. The first method is the adaptive Gaussian threshold model. This method is designed to monitor the vibration of the <b>turbopumps</b> online because it has minimal computational complexity and is easy for implementation in real time. The second method is the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) which is developed for post analysis of historical vibration signals. Via post analysis the method not only confirms the online monitoring results but also provides diagnostic results so that faults from sensors are separated from those actually from the <b>turbopumps.</b> Both of these two methods are validated to be efficient for health monitoring of the <b>turbopumps...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thrust {{specifications}} {{are often}} given as average thrust or peak thrust, sometimes without qualifying which one. Even for a non-throttled engine {{at a fixed}} altitude, thrust can often vary somewhat over the firing period due to several factors. These include intentional or unintentional mixture ratio changes, slight propellant density changes over the firing period, and variations in <b>turbopump,</b> nozzle and injector performance over the firing period.|$|E
25|$|The X-15 {{reaction}} control system (RCS), for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment, used high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and {{oxygen in the}} presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds. The HTP also fueled a <b>turbopump</b> for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions, for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas, and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.|$|E
500|$|The {{low-pressure}} fuel <b>turbopump</b> (LPFTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} {{driven by a}} two-stage turbine powered by gaseous hydrogen. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia (0.2 to 1.9 MPa) and supplies it to the high-pressure fuel <b>turbopump</b> (HPFTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost provided by the LPFTP permits the HPFTP to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPFTP operates at around 16,185 rpm, and is approximately [...] in size. It is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by being mounted to the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E

40|$|In rocket engines {{power is}} usually {{obtained}} by burning fuel and oxidizer which are mixed, pressurized, and directed to a combustion chamber {{by means of}} <b>turbopumps.</b> Roller bearings are generally used in these <b>turbopumps,</b> but because of bearing demands hydrostatic bearings were proposed. The use of such bearings is quite feasible because during flight hydrostatic lubrication can reduce roller bearing wear. A disadvantage of such proposals is that during startup, acceleration, and shutdown high pressure fluids are not available for hydrostatic bearings. The fluid lubrication film is not always present in bearings of <b>turbopumps.</b> During these periods a second bearing is required to carry the load. This requirement suggests the use of hybrid bearings in rocket engine <b>turbopumps.</b> Such duplex bearings were provided, but when their inner races are keyed to the shaft or journal {{two of them are}} required. And such duplex bearings do not wear evenly. A hybrid hydrostatic-rolling element bearing was provided wherein the rolling element bearing is locked on the stationary housing rather than on the rotating journal...|$|R
25|$|From 1940 to 1941, {{work was}} done on the P series of rockets, which used {{propellant}} <b>turbopumps</b> (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude {{of only a few}} hundred feet. The <b>turbopumps</b> worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.|$|R

500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage {{centrifugal}} pump {{driven by a}} two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the <b>turbopump</b> is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E

40|$|Space {{transfer}} {{vehicles and}} other power and propulsion systems require long-life <b>turbopumps.</b> Rolling-element bearings used in current <b>turbopumps</b> {{do not have}} sufficient life for these applications. Process fluid foil bearings have established long life, with exceptional reliability, {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and fluids in many high-speed turbomachinery applications. However, actual data on bearing performance in cryogenic fluids has been minimal. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and AlliedSignal Aerospace Systems and Equipment (ASE) have attempted to characterize the leaf-type compliant foil bearing in oxygen and nitrogen. The work performed under a joint internal research and development program between Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and ASE demonstrated that the foil bearing has load capacities of at least 266 psi in liquid oxygen and 352 psi in liquid nitrogen. In addition, the bearing demonstrated a direct damping coefficient of 40 to 50 lb-sec/in. with a damping ratio of. 7 to 1. 4 in. liquid nitrogen using a bearing sized for upper-stage <b>turbopumps.</b> With the results from this testing and the years of successful use in air cycle machines and other applications, leaf-type compliant foil bearings are ready for testing in liquid oxygen <b>turbopumps...</b>|$|R
