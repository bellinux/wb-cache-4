5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|BAe test pilots {{cleared the}} {{aircraft}} carrier ' for Harrier operations in July 1989. The carrier, which replaced the World War II-era , has a 12° ski-jump ramp. It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the 8a Escuadrilla. This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986, following the sales of AV-8S Matadors to Thailand. Instead, 9a Escuadrilla was formed on 29 September 1987, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alpha Carrier Air Group and operate the EAV-8B.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{statues of}} Morton in {{downtown}} Indianapolis. A statue {{on the east}} side of the Indiana Statehouse, facing Capitol Avenue, by sculptor Rudolf Schwarz was dedicated in 1907.

5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Girls wanted <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} {{almost as}} soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, {{at the request of the}} girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade {{was moved}} by sea to Egypt <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Force in Egypt {{defending}} the Suez Canal. In {{the first three years}} of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the First Suez Offensive, but spent most of their time patrolling in the Sinai Desert and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{there was}} {{discussion}} about a future westward extension to I-68. Such an extension would connect the western terminus of I-68 in Morgantown to WV2 in Moundsville. A 1989 proposal had suggested a toll road be built along this corridor. In 2003, the Federal Highway Administration approved the extension, {{paving the way}} for federal funding and for the road <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Highway System on completion. However, the project ran into problems due to lack of funds, and in 2008, West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin suggested dropping the project altogether, making construction of a westward extension of I-68 unlikely in the near future.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March, {{a report}} by the 3rd Tank Army's {{headquarters}} gave the corps strength at only 1,000 men. By 15March, the remnants of the 15th had been concentrated in the Belyi Kholodets area, and on 21 March were moved to the Nikitovka, Samarino, and Chepukhino region for rest and refitting. On 31March the corps was ordered <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reserve of the Supreme High Command in the Tambov area by 4 April. However, by the beginning of May it had been transferred to the Moscow Military District. The corps became part of the new 3rd Guards Tank Army within the month, with Major General Filipp Rudkin taking command on 11 June. On 1July, it had been rebuilt to a strength of 209 tanks and 16 self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Route64 was {{designated}} originally as an alignment of Route31A, a spur off of State Highway Route31 (currently U.S. Route206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route31A to Route64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PrincetonHightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the {{bridge over the}} Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.|$|E

5|$|Runnels was {{originally}} a make-up artist for CNN from 1985 to 1991, {{where she worked}} on Larry King's make-up. On the weekends, she did makeup for the wrestlers of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). When the company was purchased by Ted Turner in 1988 and renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she moved to Atlanta and continued doing make-up {{for some of the}} wrestlers. Booker Ole Anderson eventually asked her <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roster as a manager. Runnels debuted in 1990 as Alexandra York, a laptop-carrying accountant who led an alliance known as the York Foundation, a group of wrestlers with finance-themed gimmicks. The York character was created over a lunch with Tony Schiavone, one of WCW's announcers. She worked at WCW for two years.|$|E
5|$|The actual road {{names were}} not known until early 2009, when Transport Minister Simon O'Brien {{revealed}} that the section south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the section to the north <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kwinana Freeway. The route bypasses Mandurah by taking traffic around {{the eastern side of}} the Peel-Harvey Estuary prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old Coast Road, reducing the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. The roads were officially opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, and the previous Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Boonton Branch was steadily decommissioned through 1963, as the New Jersey Department of Transportation requested the Boonton Branch's alignment through Paterson as part of Interstate 80 and New Jersey Route 21 through Passaic near BE Drawbridge and the Passaic Park station. This {{was turned over to}} the Department of Transportation on October 27, 1963, after a connection was constructed at Mountain View to the Erie's former New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. The stretch from Paterson Junction to Totowa, including the Paterson High Bridge built in 1902, was abandoned and soon dismantled. However, despite the changes, the ErieLackawanna continued to lose strength and in 1975, agreed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Consolidated Rail Corporation, dubbed Conrail, effective April 1, 1976.|$|E
