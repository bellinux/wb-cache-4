5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can <b>transfer</b> <b>DNA</b> between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E

The <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> contains genes which {{are involved in the}} synthesis of plant hormones. These genes express in the plant cell and give rise to rooty-tumors at the infection site.

50|$|Mating in {{bacteria}} involves <b>transfer</b> of <b>DNA</b> {{from one}} cell {{to another and}} incorporation of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> into the recipient bacteria’s genome by homologous recombination. <b>Transfer</b> of <b>DNA</b> between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways. First, a bacterium can take up exogenous DNA released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called transformation. DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another {{by the process of}} transduction, which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage). The third method of <b>DNA</b> <b>transfer</b> is conjugation, in which a plasmid mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{conjugation}} is {{a mechanism}} of horizontal <b>DNA</b> <b>transfer.</b> The relaxase TrwC of the conjugative plasmid R 388 cleaves one strand of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> at the oriT gene, covalently attaches to it, and leads the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into the recipient cell. In addition, TrwC catalyzes site-specific {{integration of the}} <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> into its target sequence present in the genome of the recipient bacterium. Here, we report {{the analysis of the}} efficiency and specificity of the integrase activity of TrwC in human cells, using the type IV secretion system of the human pathogen Bartonella henselae to introduce relaxase-DNA complexes. Compared to Mob relaxase from plasmid pBGR 1, we found that TrwC mediated a 10 -fold increase in the rate of plasmid <b>DNA</b> <b>transfer</b> to human cells and a 100 -fold increase in the rate of chromosomal integration of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA.</b> We used linear amplification-mediated PCR and plasmid rescue to characterize the integration pattern in the human genome. DNA sequence analysis revealed mostly reconstituted oriT sequences, indicating that TrwC is active and recircularizes <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> in human cells. One TrwC-mediated site-specific integration event was detected, proving that TrwC is capable of mediating site-specific integration in the human genome, albeit with very low efficiency compared to the rate of random integration. Our results suggest that TrwC may stabilize the plasmid DNA molecules in the nucleus of the human cell, probably by recircularization of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> strand. This stabilization would increase the opportunities for integration of the DNA by the host machinery. IMPORTANCE Different biotechnological applications, including gene therapy strategies, require permanent modification of target cells. Long-term expression is achieved either by extrachromosomal persistence or by integration of the introduced DNA. Here, we studied the utility of conjugative relaxase TrwC, a bacterial protein with site-specific integrase activity in bacteria, as an integrase in human cells. Although it is not efficient as a site-specific integrase, we found that TrwC is active in human cells and promotes random integration of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> in the human genome, probably acting as a DNA chaperone until it is integrated by host mechanisms. TrwC-DNA complexes can be delivered to human cells through a type IV secretion system involved in pathogenesis. Thus, TrwC could be used in vivo to <b>transfer</b> the <b>DNA</b> of interest into the appropriate cell and promote its integration. If used in combination with a site-specific nuclease, it could lead to site-specific integration of the incoming DNA by homologous recombination...|$|R

40|$|Conjugative relaxases are the {{proteins}} that initiate bacterial conjugation by a site-specific cleavage of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> strand. In vitro, they show strand-transferase activity on single-stranded DNA, which suggests {{they may also}} be responsible for recircularization of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA.</b> In this work, we show that TrwC, the relaxase of plasmid R 388, is fully functional in the recipient cell, as shown by complementation of an R 388 trwC mutant in the recipient. TrwC transport to the recipient is also observed in the absence of <b>DNA</b> <b>transfer,</b> although it still requires the conjugative coupling protein. In addition to its role in conjugation, TrwC is able to catalyze site-specific recombination between two origin of transfer (oriT) copies. Mutations that abolish TrwC DNA strand-transferase activity also abolish oriT-specific recombination. A plasmid containing two oriT copies resident in the recipient cell undergoes recombination when a TrwC-piloted <b>DNA</b> is conjugatively <b>transferred</b> into it. Finally, we show TrwC-dependent integration of the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA</b> into a resident oriT copy in the recipient cell. Our results indicate that a conjugative relaxase is active once in the recipient cell, where it performs the nicking and strand-transfer reactions that would be required to recircularize the <b>transferred</b> <b>DNA.</b> This TrwC site-specific integration activity in recipient cells may lead to future biotechnological applications. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.
