25|$|Coulthard {{was brought}} into a Victoria XV in March 1880 to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> season's Australian {{representative}} team. He was the leading wicket-taker for his side with 5/52 and 4/28. In his first-class debut for Victoria later that year, against South Australia on the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took 3/29 and contributed 31 runs to a first innings total of 329, but his performance with the leather slumped in the second innings, conceding 49 runs for a single wicket. The following month, after top scoring (51) for a Victorian XV in a match against the Australian XI, Coulthard played in his first of three first-class contests against New South Wales. He failed to {{make much of a}} statistical impact for Victoria in any of these intercolonials.|$|E

Howard's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director. After Howard stepped down, Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz's screenplay, and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script. Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script. Lee said of the screenplay, [...] "I liked the script and really wanted to do it. Dog Day Afternoon,' directed by Sidney Lumet, {{is one of my favorite}} films, and this story was a contemporary <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> kind of a movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't {{go out of}} my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did think of it as my [...] "Killing," [...] my <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E
500|$|Julia Pistor, the film's co-producer, {{said that}} {{although}} Nickelodeon (which owns the SpongeBob trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg's integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that good for you - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E
500|$|The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{commented that}} the {{production}} by Bink! was gorgeous in nature. He compared the original three-minute long version of the song to {{the one on the}} album, writing that the original [...] "was affecting, funny (“I ordered the jerk, she said 'You are what you eat.'”) and soulful—a touch of the old Ye. And just three minutes long. But the album version is something bigger, with a magisterial guest verse from Rick Ross (appearing twice here) that comes after an odd but sumptuous acid-jazz breakdown." [...] Craig Jenkins [...] of Prefix Music opined that [...] "Bink’s beat for 'Devil in a New Dress' peters out midway through, and a live band plays a sultry, emotive <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> beat." [...] Andrew Barber of Complex stated that for the people disappointed in the briefness of the verses provided by Ross on [...] "Monster", this track more than makes up for it. Barber favorably compared the track to the style of West's older songs, and commented that it showcased West's [...] "softer, more vulnerable side, opening up about a woman." ...|$|E

500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time for that to happen."

500|$|The writers {{felt that}} it would be more {{interesting}} if Reyes was given the Ghost Rider mantle physically rather than by making a deal [...] "with some disembodied spirit or something", and decided to tie in with an older idea associated with the comic character in which the mantle is passed from one version of the Ghost Rider to another. They decided to show another Ghost Rider arrive on a motorcycle and [...] "hand off" [...] the mantle to Robbie, which Bell said [...] "promised more story to come possibly, whether now or later. It also plugged into the larger universe." [...] The other Ghost Rider is not named and no actor is credited in the episode, with the character only referred to as a [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] by Gabe in the episode, but the producers hinted with the character's design and an Easter egg in the previous episode that this was the Johnny Blaze version. This was later confirmed by others involved with the episode, with Luna later attributing the lack of onscreen clarification to legal issues. The producers did not intend to explore Blaze beyond his brief appearance in the episode, but Bell did state that he was no longer the Ghost Rider after passing on the Spirit of Vengeance to Reyes, saying that [...] "there is a tradition within the comics that there's been many Ghost Riders and our <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> was they're not simultaneously a tribe of Ghost Riders but that it's passed ... That's as far as we're going to take that part." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics of}} the disease model argue {{alcoholism}} still involves choice, not total loss of control, and stripping alcohol abusers of their choice, by applying the disease concept, {{is a threat to}} the health of the individual; the disease concept gives the substance abuser an excuse. A disease cannot be cured by force of will; therefore, adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the abuser to caregivers. Inevitably the abusers become unwilling victims, and just as inevitably they <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> role. [...] They argue that the disease theory of alcoholism exists only to benefit the professionals' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services, and the disease model has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use.|$|E
2500|$|After Smith's death, a {{succession}} crisis ensued. In this crisis {{a number of}} church leaders campaigned to lead the church.

This bill, {{which would have}} provided for {{construction of a new}} Military Road and transferred [...] of the Arlington Experimental Farm to the airport, was vetoed by President Roosevelt. But as this legislation was moving forward, Arlington County and Washington-Hoover Airport reached an agreement in mid-August whereby the county would close Military Road in exchange for a $25,000 payment to help pay for its rerouting. The House of Representatives passed legislation the following day to permit closure of the federal road. The Senate followed suit 10 days later. Again President Roosevelt vetoed the legislation, arguing that it turned federal property over to a private entity without payment in return. In September, the Bureau of Air Commerce directed all airports in the United States to assume responsibility for directing the take-off and landing of large air transport planes. But Washington-Hoover personnel refused to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> responsibility, due to the airfield's poor radio and lighting systems. After negotiations among the Air Line Pilots Association, the Bureau of Air Commerce, transport airlines, and the airport, tighter rules for large air transport craft were adopted but special provisions enacted just for Washington-Hoover which established a slightly lower threshold of safety and permitted large air transport ships to land at the airfield. But still the Air Line Pilots Association pressed for the complete closure of Washington-Hoover.|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> and on the legend of Peter Pan.

On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney.

2500|$|Bohnhoff's first work {{to use the}} Bahá’í Faith as {{a central}} aspect of a story may be her 1991 {{published}} [...] "Home Is Where…" [...] novelette summarized as [...] "A Baha'i family from the year 2112 is on a time travel research assignment in midwest USA, in 1950." [...] There {{has not been a}} published review of her work noting the presence of the Bahá'í Faith in her works generally. Her first publication was in 1989 and her publications continue through 2006. Bohnhoff, mother of two and married since 1981 (both true at least as of 2001), has also written many short stories and novelettes, some of them with a significant basis in relation to the Bahá'í Faith, in most of the well known publishing magazines: Analog Magazine, Interzone (magazine), Amazing Stories, Realms of Fantasy, and others. Another example [...] "The White Dog" [...] wherein a lady whose shocking albino appearance is eventually warmly loved in accordance with the special relationship pointed out by `Abdu'l-Bahá for a little white dog. Her longest work with a strong presence of the Bahá’í Faith is The Meri fantasy series which is a trilogy (The Meri published in 1992, Taminy in 1993, and The Crystal Rose in 1995). The series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are in fact quotes from Bahá'í scripture, while a few are from the Bible. The first and second book also carry an acknowledgement of Bahá'u'lláh, a Local Spiritual Assembly and Bahá'í community. The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a people in relation to the role and position of women. Unknown {{to the people of the}} story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of God and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or [...] "Meri". The first book focuses on a young girl destined to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior [...] "Meri" [...] who takes it as her mission to promulgate the new paradigm as the head of the religion. The third book focuses on her transition to being a head of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called The Spirit Gate has many of the same features but is written in a different context - a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly 1000AD in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of Christianity and Islam met the pagan older religion. Bahá’í themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion, however the names of some of the central figures of the religion appear near the end without strongly hinting at any spiritual prominence (names of an ambassador and Caliph, not simply religious figures.) ...|$|E
