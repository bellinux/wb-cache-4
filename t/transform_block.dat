For instance, in H.264/AVC main profile, the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> size is 4×4. In H.264/AVC High profile, the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> size can be either 4×4 or 8×8, adapted on a per-macroblock basis.|$|E

TUs use integer basis functions {{that are similar}} to the discrete cosine transform (DCT). In addition 4x4 luma <b>transform</b> <b>blocks</b> that belong to an intra coded region are transformed using an integer transform that is derived from discrete sine transform (DST). This provides a 1% bit rate reduction but was restricted to 4x4 luma <b>transform</b> <b>blocks</b> due to marginal benefits for the other transform cases. Chroma uses the same TU sizes as luma so there is no 2x2 transform for chroma.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} is presented for image data compression based upon vector quantization of the two-dimensional discrete cosine transformed coefficients. The ac energies of the <b>transformed</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are used to}} classify them into eight different ac classes. The ac coefficients of the <b>transformed</b> <b>blocks</b> of class one are set to zero, while those of classes two through eight are transmitted by seven different code books. The dc coefficients of all eight classes are scalar quantized by an adaptive uniform quantizer. As a result, only 4. 5 bits instead of eight bits are required to transmit the dc coefficient with negligible additional degradation. Overall, this algorithm requires approximately 0. 75 bits per pixel and gives an average reconstruction error of 7. 1...|$|R

5000|$|When the {{psychoacoustic model}} is inaccurate, when the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> size is restrained, or when {{aggressive}} compression is used, this {{may result in}} compression artifacts. Compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing, pre-echo, [...] "birdie artifacts", drop-outs, rattling, warbling, metallic ringing, an underwater feeling, hissing, or [...] "graininess".|$|E
50|$|At low bit rates, any lossy block-based {{coding scheme}} {{introduces}} visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries. These boundaries can be <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> boundaries, prediction block boundaries, or both, and may coincide with macroblock boundaries. The term macroblocking {{is commonly used}} regardless of the artifact's cause. Other names include tiling, mosaicing, pixelating, quilting, and checkerboarding.|$|E

50|$|Macroblock is a {{processing}} unit in image and video compression formats based on linear <b>block</b> <b>transforms,</b> {{such as the}} discrete cosine transform (DCT). A macroblock typically consists of 16×16 samples, and is further subdivided into <b>transform</b> <b>blocks,</b> and may be further subdivided into prediction blocks. Formats {{which are based on}} macroblocks include JPEG, where they are called MCU blocks, H.261, MPEG-1 Part 2, H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.263, MPEG-4 Part 2, and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. In H.265/HEVC, the macroblock as a basic {{processing unit}} has been replaced by the coding tree unit.|$|R

5000|$|Technology {{improvements}} can {{be found}} in the designs of H.263v2 Annex I and MPEG-4 Part 2, that use frequency-domain prediction of transform coefficient values, and in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, that use spatial prediction and adaptive <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> size techniques. There are also more sophisticated entropy coding than what was practical when the first JPEG design was developed. All of these new developments make M-JPEG an inefficient recording mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Block-artifacts are {{a result}} of the very {{principle}} of block transform coding. The transform (for example the discrete cosine transform) is applied to a block of pixels, and to achieve lossy compression, the transform coefficients of each block are quantized. The lower the bit rate, the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero. Statistically, images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content, so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization, which results in blurry, low-resolution blocks. In the most extreme case only the DC-coefficient, that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block, is retained, and the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> is only a single color after reconstruction.|$|E
5000|$|In JPEG, {{the image}} DC {{coefficients}} of the DCT blocks are predicted by applying DC prediction {{from the left}} neighbor <b>transform</b> <b>block,</b> and no other coeffients are predicted. In JPEG XR, 4 × 4 blocks are grouped into macroblocks of 16 × 16 samples, and the 16 DC coefficients from the 4 × 4 blocks of each macroblock are passed through another level of frequency transformation, leaving three types of coefficients to be entropy coded: the macroblock DC coefficients (called DC), macroblock-level AC coefficients (called [...] "lowpass"), and lower-level AC coefficients (called AC). Prediction of coefficient values across transform blocks {{is applied to the}} DC coefficients and to an additional row or column of AC coefficients as well.|$|E

40|$|Video {{images are}} encoded by {{transform}} coding, resulting in data blocks each including a DC-coefficient and {{a plurality of}} AC-coefficients. The coefficients {{of a number of}} said <b>transform</b> <b>blocks</b> are variable-length encoded and transmitted. In order to avoid a complete loss of datablocks in case of a transmission error, the most significant codewords of a group of blocks are transmitted first so as to achieve that at least the DC-level of the blocks is likely to be retained. The coefficients may also be recorded on a videorecorder. Fast playback of recorded images so encoded, leads to very poor quality because some data blocks are not being read in the search mode. To improve this quality the DC-coefficients and if desired predetermined AC-coefficients of selected ones of the <b>transform</b> <b>blocks</b> to be recorded on one track are packed together to form a DC-packet and such packet is recorded on a selected part of the track. The DC-packet is chosen such that it can be read out as a unit at various search speeds, and can be read partially at higher search speeds...|$|R
50|$|A {{macroblock}} {{is divided}} into transform blocks, which serve as input to the linear block transform, e.g. the DCT. In H.261, the first video codec to use macroblocks, transform blocks have a fixed size of 8×8 samples. In the YCbCr color space with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, a 16×16 macroblock consists of 16×16 luma (Y) samples and 8×8 chroma (Cb and Cr) samples. These samples are split into four Y blocks, one Cb block and one Cr block. This design is also used in JPEG and most other macroblock-based video codecs with a fixed <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> size, such as MPEG-1 Part 2 and H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2. In other chroma subsampling formats, e.g. 4:0:0, 4:2:2, or 4:4:4, the number of chroma samples in a macroblock will be smaller or larger, and the grouping of chroma samples into blocks will differ accordingly.|$|E
50|$|HEVC uses a context-adaptive binary {{arithmetic}} coding (CABAC) algorithm that is fundamentally similar to CABAC in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. CABAC {{is the only}} entropy encoder method that is allowed in HEVC while there are two entropy encoder methods allowed by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. CABAC and the entropy coding of transform coefficients in HEVC were designed for a higher throughput than H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, while maintaining higher compression efficiency for larger <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> sizes relative to simple extensions. For instance, the number of context coded bins have been reduced by 8× and the CABAC bypass-mode has been improved {{in terms of its}} design to increase throughput. Another improvement with HEVC is that the dependencies between the coded data has been changed to further increase throughput. Context modeling in HEVC has also been improved so that CABAC can better select a context that increases efficiency when compared with H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.|$|E
50|$|The filter {{operates}} {{on the edges}} of each 4×4 or 8×8 <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> in the luma and chroma planes of each picture. Each small block's edge is assigned a boundary strength based on whether it is also a macroblock boundary, the coding (intra/inter) of the blocks, whether references (in motion prediction and reference frame choice) differ, and whether it is a luma or chroma edge. Stronger levels of filtering are assigned by this scheme where there is likely to be more distortion. The filter can modify as many as three samples on either side of a given block edge (in the case where an edge is a luma edge that lies between different macroblocks and {{at least one of them}} is intra coded). In most cases it can modify one or two samples on either side of the edge (depending on the quantization step size, the tuning of the filter strength by the encoder, the result of an edge detection test, and other factors).|$|E

Uniform-threshold quantization is employed to quantize the transform coefficients. An algorithm for optimum stepsize (or, equivalently, entropy) assignment among the quantizers is developed. A simple asymptotic formula indicating the high rate performance of the <b>block</b> <b>transform</b> quantization schemes is presented. Finally, specific results determining the rate- distortion performance of the entropy-constrained <b>block</b> <b>transform</b> quantization scheme operating upon first-order Gauss-Markov and Laplace-Markov sources are presented and appropriate comparisons with the Haung and Schulthesis <b>block</b> <b>transform</b> quantization, vector quantization and predictive encoding are rendered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{algorithm}} called spatially varying transform (SVT) {{is proposed}} to improve the coding efficiency of video coders. SVT enables video coders to vary {{the position of the}} <b>transform</b> <b>block,</b> unlike state-of-art video codecs where the position of the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> is fixed. In addition to changing the position of the <b>transform</b> <b>block,</b> the size of the transform can also be varied within the SVT framework, to better localize the prediction error so that the underlying correlations are better exploited. It is shown in this paper that by varying the position of the <b>transform</b> <b>block</b> and its size, characteristics of prediction error are better localized, and the coding efficiency is thus improved. The proposed algorithm is implemented and studied in the H. 264 /AVC framework. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves 5. 85 % bitrate reduction compared to H. 264 /AVC on average over a wide range of test set. Gains become more significant at medium to high bitrates for most tested sequences and the bitrate reduction may reach 13. 50 %, which makes the proposed algorithm very suitable for future video coding solutions focusing on high fidelity video applications. The gain in coding efficiency is achieved with a similar decoding complexity which makes the proposed algorithm easy to be incorporated in video codecs. However, the encoding complexity of SVT can be relatively high because of the need to perform a number of rate distortion optimization (RDO) steps to select the best location parameter (LP), which indicates the position of the transform. In this paper, a novel low complexity algorithm is also proposed, operating on a macroblock and a block level, to reduce the encoding complexity of SVT. Experimental results show that the proposed low complexity algorithm can reduce the number of LPs to be tested in RDO by about 80 % with only a marginal penalty in the coding efficiency.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel context based binary {{arithmetic}} coding with a stochastic bit-reshuffling scheme to improve bit-plane coding of MPEG- 4 Fine Granularity Scalability (FGS). Current approach has not fully considered the correlations across bitplanes and among adjacent <b>transform</b> <b>blocks.</b> To fully exploit correlation, we construct context based on spatial correlation and energy distribution of <b>transform</b> <b>blocks.</b> Furthermore, {{we consider the}} context across bit-planes to reduce side information. In addition, when the enhancement-layer is partially decoded, the block update in a raster scan causes unbalanced quality of a decoded frame. To have consistent subjective quality, we reshuffle the bit transmission order with a probability model. Since both encoder and decoder have identical probability model, no extra overhead are required. For faster convergence of statistic adaptation, we replace the traditional 8 x 8 floating point DCT with 4 x 4 integer transform. As compared to MPEG- 4 FGS based bit-plane coding, we can improve the PSNR by 0. 5 ~ 1 dB and offer better subjective quality.
