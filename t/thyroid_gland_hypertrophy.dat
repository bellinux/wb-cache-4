In contrast to p,p-DDD, which has direct cytotoxic effects on the adrenal glands via an unknown mechanism, amphenone B does not have cytotoxic effects, and instead causes adrenal and <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> due to respective inhibition of corticosteroid and thyroxine biosynthesis, subsequent loss of negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes, and consequent hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland.|$|E
40|$|The ovarian {{changes in}} the rabbit {{following}} complete thyroidectomy {{have been reported in}} a previous communication [Chu, 1944]. It was pointed out that {{in the absence of the}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> of the follicular apparatus resulted from the increased production of follicle-stimulating hormone, but that the life span of the corpus luteum did not seem to be shortened although the pituitary luteinizing hormone was diminished. As a result of follicular hypertrophy, the oestrogen in the circulation would be increased. Since such an increase over a certain physiological level would disturb the course of pregnancy [Parkes, Dodds & Noble, 1938; Heckel & Allen, 1938; and others], an investigation into the relationship between the thyroid gland and gestation in the rabbit was undertaken. MATERIAL AND METHOD The experimental animals were divided into four groups: (1) normal rabbits were rendered pregnant and were thyroidectomized at various times during gestation;(2) pregnancy was induced in thyroidectomized rabbits; (3) pregnancy was induced in thyroid-fed, thyroidectomized rabbits; and (4) thyroid feeding was started in thyroidectomized rabbits after successful mating. All the animals were kept in separate cages and the course of gestation was carefully watched. They were fed on the same diet and were kept under identical laboratory conditions. RESULTS The effects of thyroidectomy in pregnant rabbits Eleven rabbits were thyroidectomized between the 2 nd and 29 th day of gestation.

40|$|The {{following}} conclusions may {{be drawn}} from the experiments presented in this article. 1. Excessive meat diet develops <b>hypertrophy</b> of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> A definite <b>hypertrophy</b> of the parathyroid gland under the same conditions has not been established. A meat diet does not develop <b>hypertrophy</b> of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> when insufficiency of the parathyroid gland exists at the same time, even if no clinical symptoms are present. Where a pronounced hypertrophy caused by a meat diet has already developed, the hypertrophy disappears and the gland assumes its ordinary appearance after extirpation of a sufficiently large number of parathyroid glands. 2. After parathyroidectomy no <b>hypertrophy</b> of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> takes place. In chronic tetany the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> seems, on the contrary, to atrophy in spite of a meat diet. 3. After complete extirpation of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> the parathyroid gland does not change its structure, even in cases where the cachexia lasts for several years. Small remaining parts of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> may through <b>hypertrophy</b> develop into compact tissue and thereby seemingly present some points of resemblance to the parathyroid gland. 4. When the parathyroid <b>gland</b> <b>hypertrophies,</b> as in some forms of chronic tetany, this hypertrophy is characterized by the development of large, transparent, sharply defined cells, with large nuclei rich in chromatin. 5. The parathyroid and <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> are independent organs, each having specific functions. This, however, does not exclude the occurrence of a direct or indirect interaction in the functions of the two systems. 6. There is reason to believe that an insufficiency of the parathyroid gland checks to some extent the function of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> No proof of the existence of a vicarious cooperation between the two glands has been established...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a wide range of {{ammonium}} perchlorate (AP) concentrations in drinking water on thyroid function in bobwhite quail chicks was investigated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of exposure. We measured plasma thyroid hormones (THs) to evaluate organismal thyroid status, thyroid weights to evaluate hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis activation, and thyroidal TH content to assess TH stores. At the highestAP exposures plasmaTHswere decreased, <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were <b>hypertrophied,</b> and thyroidal TH content was decreased. As in our previous studies, thyroidal thyroxine (T 4) con-tent was the most sensitive indicator of decreased thyroid function; plasma T 4 and thyroid weight were much less sensitive. The lack of sensitivity of these variables appears to result from cyclic patterns of thyroid responses involving the HPT axis and intermittent release of stored THs from the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> With sustained AP exposure (8 weeks), at the lowest range of AP concentrations used, chicks showed adaptation in thyroid function that fully compensated for the initial (2 week) effects of AP. At the intermediate AP concen-trations there was partial compensation for the initial AP effects. At the highest AP exposures used, thyroid function was very low throughout the study, with no indication of compensatory responses. The capability of chicks to increase some aspects of their thyroid function adaptively in response to some levels of sustained AP exposure is contrary to the common generalization that developing animals are most vulnerable to environmental contaminants.

40|$|Introduction. Lingual <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> {{is a rare}} anomaly of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> development, {{occurring}} {{more frequently}} in females. If it causes local symptomatology such as dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea it is diagnosed in childhood, however, if it is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed in adulthood. Case Outline. We present a 23 -year-old female patient in whom we diagnosed lingual <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> coincidentally during diagnostic procedures of a concomitant disease. The application of 131 I scintigraphy showed an oval field of intensive accumulation of radio markers in the zone of medial face line, around tongue base, with the absence of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> in its physiological position. Functional testing proved primary hypothyroidism and we started the application of substitution therapy. The application of levothyroxine resulted in reaching euthyroid state and the reduction of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> size. Conclusion. We present a very rare anomaly of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> and so far {{there have been no}} clear attitudes about further treatment.

40|$|Objective-To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} ultrasonography for <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> assessment in healthy Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), describe the ultrasonographic appearance of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and adjacent anatomic structures, and identify potential associations between variations in <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> morphology and demographic features in this species. Animals- 18 captive Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. Procedures- 1, 404 ultrasonographic examinations of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and adjacent anatomic structures (eg, cervical lymph nodes, musculature, and vasculature) were performed during the > 3 -year study period. Shape, echogenicity, and homogeneity of <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were assessed, and glands were categorized into morphological configurations {{on the basis of}} results of 2 -D and 3 -D ultrasonographic evaluation. Associations between demographic factors and <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> morphology were assessed. Results-Thyroid lobes appeared elliptical or fusiform in the transverse scan plane and round to oval in longitudinal scan planes; morphologically, glands comprised 2 lobes joined by an isthmus or a roughly diamond-shaped structure located on the ventral surface of the trachea. Major blood vessels and cervical lymph nodes were identified. Thyroid parenchyma was typically uniform and homogeneous, with echogenic reticulations and well-defined borders. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>glands</b> were hypoechoic or isoechoic relative to the sternocephalicus muscle; echogenicity was greater in adolescents than in adults. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume differed between sexes, between sexually mature and immature dolphins, and among age groups and was positively correlated with body length and weight.

40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} shown the {{limitation}} of the World Health Organization (WHO) / International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency (ICCIDD) -adopted <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume references as universal normative values for <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume. So we decided to measure <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume by sonography in schoolchildren in Rasht, Gilan Province, Iran - Rasht is a metropolitan city on the Caspian Sea coast - and compare them to WHO normative values. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 2, 522 schoolchildren, aged 6 - 13 years, in Rasht, Gilan Province, Iran were selected by multistage random sampling. Data were collected on their age, sex, weight, height, body surface area (BSA), and <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> size by palpation and sonography. The terminal phalange of thumb finger volume was calculated with the same formula used in sonography, for the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> in 1, 085 of these cases. Results: Goiter prevalence was 64 % (1613 cases) by palpation, 76. 1 % (1228 subjects) grade I and 23. 9 % (385 cases) grade II. The mean <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume in girls was more than boys (3. 67 ± 1. 89 mL vs 3. 41 ± 1. 58 mL, P < 0. 0001). According to the 1997 WHO <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume reference, none of the children had goiter based on BSA and age even in those with grade II goiters (23. 9 %). In contrast, the median <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume in our cases was larger than the 2004 WHO reference. The best single predictor of <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume was age (R 2 = 0. 391, P < 0. 0001) followed by BSA (R 2 = 0. 151, P < 0. 0001). There was also {{a significant difference between}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and finger volume in all grades of goiter and grade II goiters (3 ± 1. 4 mL vs 9. 59 ± 2. 4 mL; P < 0. 0001. 4. 3 ± 1. 4 mL vs 9. 3 ± 2. 5 mL; P < 0. 0001).

The <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> status indexes in them did not differ from patients with normal <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volume. Reliable increasing of the peripheral resistance index was revealed in lower thyroid artery according to the ultrasonic study data under the reduced <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> size. Conclusions. High incidence of hypothyroidism and AT-TPO carriage in RA was revealed. Hypothyroidism development is accompanied by high clinic-laboratory RA activity. The reduction of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> volumes in RA is possibly stipulated not only by autoimmunal pathology, but also chronic ischemia of the organ in the conditions of immune-complex vasculitis and early atherosclerosis. The TTG level in patients with RA is defined not only by pathology of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> but glycocorticoid therapy as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} {{branch of}} the superior laryngeal nerve (ELN) is intimately associated with the superior thyroid artery (STA) {{in relation to the}} superior pole of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> rendering it vulnerable to injury during the ligation of this vessel during thyroidectomy. Although most texts acknowledge the fact that the nerve is in close relation to the STA, there has not been an anatomical study to relate the position of the ELN to the superior pole of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the shortest distance, from the most superior point of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland,</b> to the ELN. Bilateral micro-dissection on 43 adult cadavers, excluding those with thyroid pathology and previous thyroidectomies, was undertaken. The most superior point of the superior pole of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> was identified and the shortest distance to the ELN was measured with a digital calliper (accuracy 0. 01 mm). The metric study indicated a mean distance from the ELN to the superior pole of a normal sized <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> of 5. 76 mm (range: 2. 00 - 11. 26) on the right, and 6. 17 mm (range: 2. 78 - 13. 48) on the left. From the literature, it is clear that the ELN may even be closer to the superior pole of an enlarged <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> The recommendation to stay on the substance of the superior pole of the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> when ligating the STA remains valid, as the nerve is extremely close in relation to the superior pole of the normal <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> maintains {{basal metabolism}} in tissues for optimal function. Determining thyroid volume {{is important in}} assessing growth and involution. Volume estimation is also important in stereological studies. Direct measurements of colloid volume and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of the follicular cells may provide important information about <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> function such as hormone storage and secretion, which helps understand the changes at morphological and functional levels. The present study determined the colloid volume using simple stereological principle and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of 4 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and 2 human <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands.</b> In both dolphin and human <b>thyroid</b> <b>glands,</b> {{the size of the}} follicles tended to be quite variable. The distribution of large and small follicles within the <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> was also found to be random in both the dolphin and human thyroid gland; however, the size of follicles appeared to decrease as a function of increasing age in the dolphin <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland.</b> The mean colloid volume of the dolphin <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> and human <b>thyroid</b> <b>gland</b> was 1. 22 × 10 (5) µm(3) and 7. 02 × 10 (5) µm(3) respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had {{a significant difference in the}} mean colloid volume. The mean N/C ratio of the dolphin thyroid follicular epithelia and human follicular epithelia was 0. 50 and 0. 64 respectively. The dolphin and human subjects had a significant difference in the mean N/C ratio. This information contributes to understanding dolphin thyroid physiology and its structural adaptations to meet the physical demands of the aquatic environment, and aids with ultrasonography and corrective therapy in live subjects...|$|R
