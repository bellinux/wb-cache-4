Sonnabend served as Medical Director of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E
5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E

More than 240 of his acta have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.|$|E

5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors <b>that</b> <b>contributed</b> to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E

However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

This paper examines the factors <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to teen dating violence and more specifically the factors <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to dating violence among Latino youth. After determining the factors <b>that</b> <b>contribute</b> to this problem, prevention programs are examined to assess how well they address those issues. Currently, multiple dating violence prevention programs are used across the country; however, most of them do not address the needs of Latino youth. Suggestions on how to make these programs more appropriate for Latinos are provided...|$|R

The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.|$|E
