500|$|Wenger {{replied to}} Mourinho's {{comments}} {{by arguing that}} although plenty of managers have won the Champions League, most would not be considered greats – [...] "What is important is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at their careers in 10, 15 or 20 years. What kind of quality have you brought through in your work and on how consistent a level have you done it?" [...] He went on to suggest a manager's importance is [...] "...over the longer distance. The continuity in his career. Can he get good teams together and play in a certain style?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> for" [...] {{and that there}} was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E
