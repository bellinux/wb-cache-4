50|$|A {{study of}} limits and {{continuity}} in multivariable calculus yields many counter-intuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions.

Indeed, the functionapproaches zero along any {{line through the}} origin. However, when the origin is approached along a parabola , it has a limit of 0.5.

This gives rise to another type of "bubbles": limit outcomes corresponding to small perturbations of parameters are different.
