The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, it must also divide the left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E

5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

25|$|In one dimension, Sperner's Lemma can be {{regarded}} as a discrete version of the intermediate value theorem. In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> switch values an odd number of times.|$|E
25|$|Each {{internal}} node’s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees.

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the central bank buys bonds by simply creating money—it is not financed in any way. It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system. If a central bank is to maintain a target interest rate, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> necessarily buy and sell government bonds on the open market in order to maintain the correct amount of reserves in the system.|$|E
25|$|Circles: The circles are of {{two sizes}} – small and large. Small circle {{represents}} 's' (sing) and 'z' (gaze). Big circle represents 'ses' and 'swa'. If the big circle comes initially in the stroke it represents 'swa' (sweep, but not sway). Elsewhere it represents 'ses' the vowel {{in the middle}} can be any of the vowel or diphthong (crisis, crises and exercise). If the vowel is anything other than 'e' <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be represented inside the circle.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} {{had been}} long before selected, and {{the whole of the}} ground had even been surveyed, with a view to meet the contingency which had now actually occurred; but <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be remembered, that in this design the co-operation of the IV Corps (Bülow's) was fully expected, whereas the latter had now become a doubtful question: and hence it was that Blücher was led to place more reliance upon a direct support from Wellington, than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
25|$|Some {{health care}} plans are {{exempted}} from Title I requirements, such as long-term health plans and limited-scope plans such as dental or vision plans that are offered separately from the general health plan. However, if such benefits {{are part of the}} general health plan, then HIPAA still applies to such benefits. For example, if the new plan offers dental benefits, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> count creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan towards any of its exclusion periods for dental benefits.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{may result}} {{from the fact that}} the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, a member of the black widow genus Latrodectus. To the extent that such entomological {{information}} was known to the general public, it was perhaps thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.|$|E

Altering the belief would be difficult, as Keech and her group were {{committed}} at considerable expense to maintain it. Another option would be to enlist social support for their belief.

25|$|In his work, and in {{collaboration}} with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also {{the theory that the}} universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition. In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have begun as a singularity. In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a similar}} {{procedure}} {{may be used}} with breadth-first search in place of depth-first search. Again, each node is given the opposite color to its parent in the search forest, in breadth-first order. If, when a vertex is colored, there exists an edge connecting it to a previously-colored vertex with the same color, then this edge together with the paths in the breadth-first search forest connecting its two endpoints to their lowest common ancestor forms an odd cycle. If the algorithm terminates without finding an odd cycle in this way, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have found a proper coloring, and can safely conclude that the graph is bipartite.|$|E
25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be put to the people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law will be passed. Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|E
