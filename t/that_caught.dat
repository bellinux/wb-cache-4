5|$|Andrei {{was played}} by Gabriel Huian (untrained actor, {{previously}} appearing {{in a video}} clip <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> the director's attention).

Apparently attracted to Mădălina Ghiţescu, Huian showed a different attitude than that of other candidates, which only convinced the director further.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma hated the demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish {{drawing of a}} young Link <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> their eye. Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin in a similar style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve this look, they used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
5|$|The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which {{relied on}} rain to water their crops, but others {{utilized}} runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe {{that prior to}} the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited {{to members of the}} surrounding community.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, Middle Tennessee quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play drive. It included a fake punt <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard pass for a first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Middle Tennessee re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and Middle Tennessee subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the Middle Tennessee 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. Middle Tennessee defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone to preserve a Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of hare {{coursing}} simply involved two dogs chasing a hare, the winner being the dog <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> the hare; {{this could be}} for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E

5|$|Zur's {{maneuver}} sent Israel's {{forces into}} unknown territory, and they encountered an Egyptian entrenchment <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> them unawares. His original {{plan was to}} send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi's company, but when fire was opened on Harpaz's men (at approximately 04:00), Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault. Harpaz decided {{to do this in}} three single-platoon waves: the first two would attack the Egyptians, while the third would provide cover for the forces. The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt's army. After advancing, they encountered what were probably Bren carriers, which their commander reported were tanks. Harpaz then sent the second, more experienced, platoon of 15 men, who were also able to better utilize the cover fire. Eventually, the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered to do so and the attack was only two platoons strong. However, this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer {{on the other side of}} the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, President-elect Taft {{announced}} his intent to nominate Senator Philander C. Knox to be Secretary of State. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause {{emerged as a}} problem <b>that</b> <b>caught</b> those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox {{would not have to}} forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to suspend the rules and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different procedural rule was applied, it passed by a 173–115 majority vote and President Roosevelt subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.|$|E
