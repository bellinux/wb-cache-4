5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSteroid hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and {{estradiol}} {{are derived}} from cholesterol, a major constituent of biomembranes. Although <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> {{might be expected to}} associate with the bilayer in a fashion similar to that of cholesterol, their biological action in regulating transcription of target genes involves transbilayer transfer by free diffusion, which is not observed for cholesterol. We used a novel combination of a continuum-solvent model and the downhill simplex search method for the calculation of the free energy of interaction of these hormones with lipid membranes, and compared these values to that of cholesterol-membrane interaction. <b>The</b> <b>hormones</b> were represented in atomic detail and the membrane as a structureless hydrophobic slab embedded in implicit water. A deep free-energy minimum of ∼− 15 kcal/mol was obtained for cholesterol at its most favorable location in the membrane, whereas the most favorable locations for <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> were associated with shallower minima of − 5. 0 kcal/mol or higher. The free-energy difference, which is predominantly due to the substitution of cholesterol's hydrophobic tail with polar groups, explains the different manner in which cholesterol and <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> interact with <b>the</b> membrane. Further calculations were conducted to estimate the rate of transfer of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> from <b>the</b> aqueous phase into hexane, and from hexane back into the aqueous phase. The calculated rates agreed reasonably well with measurements in closely related systems. Based on these calculations, we suggest putative pathways for the free diffusion of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> across biomembranes. Overall, the calculations imply that <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> may rapidly cross biomembrane barriers.

Increased 14 CO 2 production from] 1 - 14 C]oleate in response to <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> was observed when hepatocytes from starved rats were incubated with 3 -mercaptopicolinate, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. 3 -Mercaptopicolinate inhibited uptake and esterification of [1 - 14 C]oleate, slightly increased 14 CO 2 production from [1 - 14 C]oleate and greatly increased the [3 -hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] ratio. In the presence of 3 -mercaptopicolinate 14 CO 2 production {{in response to the}} catecholamines was blocked by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine and required extracellular Ca 2 +. The effects of vasopressin and angiotensin were also Ca 2 +-dependent. The actions of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> of 14 CO 2 production from [I- 14 C]oleate by hepatocytes from starved rats in the presence of 3 -mercaptopicolinate thus have the characteristics of the response to <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> found with hepatocytes from fed rats incubated without 3 -mercaptopicolinate. The stimulatory effects of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> on 14 CO 2 production from [1 - 14 C]oleate were not the result of decreased esterification (as <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> increased esterification) or increased beta-oxidation. It is suggested that the effect of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> to increase 14 CO 2 production from [1 - 14 C]oleate are mediated by CA 2 +-activation of NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, the 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and/or electron transport.

The concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> oxytocin, vasopressin, testosterone and prolactin were measured in men becoming fathers, before and after birth, and in a control group. Both groups were tested for their care interest and attitude with two Implicit Association Tests (IAT) and the Child Care Activities Scale.

On top of that, all participants received three intranasal sprays with oxytocin, vasopressin or placebo, spread over three weeks, to investigate the effect of altered availability of <b>the</b> <b>hormones</b> on <b>the</b> test scores of the two IATs in a repeated-measures design.

5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} also {{produces}} <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> calcitonin, which helps regulate blood calcium levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin {{in response to}} high blood calcium. Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, as calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an {{endocrine}} gland in the neck, {{consisting of two}} lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For <b>the</b> <b>hormone</b> signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to <b>the</b> <b>hormone,</b> the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E
