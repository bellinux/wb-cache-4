5000|$|Landeza {{never forgot}} his {{frustration}} {{as a young}} man trying to learn slack key guitar in California. As he began to tour across the country, he leaned there were many would-be slack key guitar students who had plenty of enthusiasm, but lacked a teacher. To this end, in 2004 Patrick established the Institute of Hawaiian Music and Culture. [...] "It was a <b>traveling</b> <b>workshop</b> or mini camp where you would learn Hawaiian language, culture, slack key and `ukulele," [...] Patrick says. [...] "The instructors included Cyril Pahinui, Dennis and David Kamakahi, Keoki Kahumoku, Herb Ohta, Jr. and me for the music, and a Hawaiian language teacher. We would run different configurations. We covered the Bay Area, Seattle and Los Angeles." [...] He also released an instructional DVD, [...] "Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Made Easy" [...] (Lamb Productions) in 2004. [...] He continues to hold instructional workshops at events around the country, such as the Swannanoa Gathering in North Carolina, the Healdsburg Guitar Festival, and the FAR-West Folk Alliance conference. In * his lessons were published in Acoustic Guitar Magazine.|$|E
40|$|The {{implicit}} {{objective of}} the biennial "international - <b>Traveling</b> <b>Workshop</b> on Interactions between Sparse models and Technology" (iTWIST) is to foster collaboration between international scientific teams by disseminating ideas through both specific oral/poster presentations and free discussions. For its second edition, the iTWIST workshop {{took place in the}} medieval and picturesque town of Namur in Belgium, from Wednesday August 27 th till Friday August 29 th, 2014. The workshop was conveniently located in "The Arsenal" building within walking distance of both hotels and town center. iTWIST' 14 has gathered about 70 international participants and has featured 9 invited talks, 10 oral presentations, and 14 posters on the following themes, all related to the theory, application and generalization of the "sparsity paradigm": Sparsity-driven data sensing and processing; Union of low dimensional subspaces; Beyond linear and convex inverse problem; Matrix/manifold/graph sensing/processing; Blind inverse problems and dictionary learning; Sparsity and computational neuroscience; Information theory, geometry and randomness; Complexity/accuracy tradeoffs in numerical methods; Sparsity? What's next?; Sparse machine learning and inference. Comment: 69 pages, 24 extended abstracts, iTWIST' 14 website: [URL]...|$|E
