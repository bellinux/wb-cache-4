5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree,</b> the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, a modern village (al-Mishrifeh) was built within the ancient site. Houses were built {{on top of}} the royal palace floors, {{damaging}} them <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree,</b> but also protecting the underlying ruins. In 1982, the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums resettled the inhabitants in a new village next to the ancient tell, thus making the site available for modern archaeological research.|$|E

5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} occurs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> in all people, {{people with}} FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis {{due to the}} excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends {{on the number of}} LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reviving}} the ancient Olympic Games {{had been raised}} {{from time to time}} during the early and mid 19th century, inspired <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> by romanticism and patriotism. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work Dialogue of the Dead, proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition. In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} from the war, Porto Alegre resumed his {{political}} career. He became an active advocate for {{the abolition of slavery}} and a patron in the fields of literature and science. His death came on 18 July 1875 while again serving in Parliament. He was highly esteemed until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. Regarded as too closely associated with the fallen regime, Porto Alegre slipped into obscurity. His reputation was eventually rehabilitated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> by historians, some of whom consider him to be among Brazil's greatest military figures.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree,</b> then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2+ sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation, which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process. Normally, mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by pumping out protons.|$|E

5|$|The town of Chiprovtsi {{and several}} of the {{surrounding}} villages were administratively organized as a has, or a private possession of the sultan's royal family and later of the sultan's mother. The special status of the area meant that the local Christians would not be subject to the usual discriminatory laws, but would have to pay an annual tribute of silver to the sultan. Later on, the estate was organized as a waqf, a land devoted for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. Chiprovtsi and the region were inhabited exclusively by Christians and they had the privilege to perform their rituals in public without discrimination. The only Turkish person in the town was the sultan's representative and no Turks were allowed to settle there, as the local Bulgarians enjoyed self-government <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>degree</b> and were administered by an elected council of eminent Bulgarian residents (knezove).
