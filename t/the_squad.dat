Other members of <b>the</b> <b>squad</b> include Sarah Walker, the {{daughter}} of a Centauri Council member; Ernest Schuyler, who is known for his sense of humor; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford. Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with <b>the</b> <b>squad.</b> Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of <b>the</b> <b>squad,</b> and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus. Live-action full-motion video cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions.|$|E

He was joined in <b>the</b> <b>squad</b> by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, {{despite the fact that}} both had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Mass Effect 2 is squad-based and {{a maximum}} of two squad members may {{accompany}} the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while <b>the</b> <b>squad</b> members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for <b>the</b> <b>squad</b> members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and places strong emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to <b>the</b> <b>squad</b> members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E

5|$|In May, McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match, with <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad</b> facing Michaels. <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad</b> instead attacked Michaels {{before the}} match started, and Triple H {{came out to}} help <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad.</b> Triple H felt disrespected by <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad</b> however, and as a result, helped Michaels instead. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad.</b> DX played various sophomoric jokes on <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad</b> and <b>the</b> McMahons, as well as defeating <b>The</b> Spirit <b>Squad</b> in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|R

50|$|An {{infantry}} platoon {{was divided}} into two large sections, each of twenty men, which were further split into rifle and light machine gun <b>squads.</b> <b>The</b> section was commanded by a Sergeant, who also controlled <b>the</b> LMG <b>squad.</b> <b>The</b> latter {{was made up of}} two Breda 30s, each manned by a Corporal gunner, an assistant gunner and two ammunition bearers. The balance of the section was found in <b>the</b> rifle <b>squad</b> of eleven men. Due to the importance of its extra firepower, the Breda 30 was most often given to <b>the</b> <b>squad's</b> most reliable soldier (unlike other armies of the time, it was not rare to see an NCO brandishing himself <b>the</b> <b>squad's</b> automatic weapon). <b>The</b> manual indicates that <b>the</b> two <b>squads</b> were to operate as distinct elements, with the two LMGs supporting <b>the</b> Rifle <b>squad</b> onto its objective. At the time, most other armies embedded a light machine gun with each Section/Squad, themselves roughly half the size of <b>the</b> Italian <b>Squad,</b> which by comparison seems an unwieldy organisation. Individual weapons are given as pistols for each Corporal gunner, a carbine for the Major Sergeant and rifles for all others.|$|R
