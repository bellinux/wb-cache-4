5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b> But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E
5|$|A newly {{designed}} braille template {{was used for}} the first time in a National election, allowing blind voters to vote independently for the first time. In previous elections, blind voters had to communicate <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> of party to a voting official, who then filled in a ballot sheet on their behalf.|$|E
5|$|After {{the severe}} {{injuries}} sustained by Vince on the June 23, 3-hour edition of Raw, Shane appeared requesting for the Raw Superstars to stand together during {{what was a}} 'turbulent time'.

The following week, Shane announced Mike Adamle as <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> to be the new Raw General Manager.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, the six {{remaining}} venues which will host one round of 16 and three group stage matches were selected among the remaining candidate venues. Each voting member ranked the venues in their order of preference: six points for <b>their</b> first <b>choice,</b> five points for <b>their</b> second <b>choice,</b> four points for <b>their</b> third <b>choice,</b> three points for <b>their</b> fourth <b>choice,</b> two points for <b>their</b> fifth <b>choice,</b> and one point for <b>their</b> sixth <b>choice.</b> The six venues {{with the highest}} points total were selected.|$|R

In order to find support for <b>their</b> <b>choice,</b> these men have created and joined many support networks.|$|E
5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, {{as a matter of}} law, a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent that}} it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

40|$|Human factors play an {{important}} role in the management of occupational safety, especially in high-hazard workplaces such as commercial grain-handling facilities. Employee decision-making patterns represent an essential component of the safety system within a work environment. This research describes the process used to create a safety decision-making scenario to measure the process that grain-handling employees used to make choices in a safety-related work task. A sample of 160 employees completed safety decision-making simulations based on a hypothetical but realistic scenario in a grain-handling environment. <b>Their</b> <b>choices</b> and the information they used to make <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were recorded. Although the employees emphasized safety information in their decision-making process, not all of <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were safe <b>choices.</b> Factors influencing <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> are discussed, and implications for industry, management, and workers are shared...|$|R
5000|$|The problem also {{exists in}} Instant-runoff voting, though it is reduced, because voters {{are allowed to}} rank <b>their</b> {{candidate}} <b>choices,</b> with <b>their</b> vote transferring to <b>their</b> second <b>choice</b> if <b>their</b> first <b>choice</b> does not win, and to <b>their</b> third <b>choice</b> if <b>their</b> second <b>choice</b> does not win, and so on. Other preferential voting or ranked ballot voting systems also suffer from variations of the spoiler effect, as they fail the IIA criterion (see §Mathematical definitions).|$|R

Citizens are free to preach, practice and propagate any religion of <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{wildcard}} (joker) {{system was}} introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semifinal, were invited by SVT to enter a song of <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards.

Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b> The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E

40|$|People may behave prosocially {{not only}} because they value the welfare of others, but also to protect their own reputation. We {{examined}} the separate roles of altruism and reputational concerns in moral-hazard gambling tasks, which allowed subjects to gamble with a partner's money. In Study 1, subjects who were told that their partner would see <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were more prosocial. In Study 2, subjects were more prosocial to a single partner when <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were transparent than when <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were attributed to a third party. We conclude that reputational concerns are a key restraint on selfish exploitation under moral hazard...|$|R

5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the European Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. These frequently hold pre-meetings of their European Council members, prior to its meetings. However, the European Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and decisions are generally made on these lines, though ideological alignment can colour their political agreements and <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> of appointments (such as their president).|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> of habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch {{from which to}} watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
5|$|In 1575 {{the nobility}} {{commenced}} a new election process. The magnates {{tried to force}} the candidacy of Emperor Maximilian II, and on 12 December Archbishop Uchański even announced his election. This effort was thwarted by the execution movement szlachta party led by Mikołaj Sienicki and Jan Zamoyski; <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> was Stephen Báthory, Prince of Transylvania. Sienicki quickly arranged for a 15 December proclamation of Anna Jagiellon, sister of Sigismund Augustus, as the reigning queen, with Stefan Batory added as her husband and king jure uxoris. Szlachta's pospolite ruszenie supported the selection with their arms. Batory took over Kraków, where the couple's crowning ceremony took place on 1 May 1576.|$|E
