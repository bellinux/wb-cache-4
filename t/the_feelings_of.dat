We explored the hypothesis that one factor underlying <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing is <b>the</b> degree of prior learning for the sought-after item. Undergraduates learned a list in which various items were acquired to a criterion of either one correct recall, two correct recalls, or four correct recalls. Four weeks later, the subjects had a recall-retention test, then rank ordered the nonrecalled items in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing {{for each of the}} nonrecalled items, and finally had a recognition test on the nonrecalled items. A major finding (in addition to those summarized {{at the end of the}} article) was that <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing for nonrecalled items increased with the degree of prior learning.

With a haptic robot, participants made series of vertical pointing actions on a virtual surface, which was sometimes postponed by a small temporal delay (15 or 65 ms).

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
