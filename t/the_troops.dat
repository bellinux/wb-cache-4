5|$|After this, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> went to {{the nearby}} village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C.

After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E

5|$|On March 27 {{the eight}} soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians {{who were in}} the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder.

Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The British troops remained, however, and {{tensions}} between soldiers and civilians eventually {{resulted in the}} killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of March 1770. Hancock was not involved in the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of <b>the</b> <b>troops.</b> Meeting with Bernard's successor, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, and the British officer in command, Colonel William Dalrymple, Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> did not leave. Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> withdrawn. His reelection to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.|$|E
