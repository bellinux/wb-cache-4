40|$|The {{subject of}} {{tribology}} encompasses the friction, wear and lubrication of mechanical components such as bearings and gears. Tribological practices {{are aimed at}} ensuring that such components operate with high efficiency (low friction) and achieve long lives. On spacecraft mechanisms the route to achieving these goals brings its own unique challenges. This review describes the problems posed by the space environment, the types of <b>tribological</b> <b>component</b> used on spacecraft and the approaches taken to their lubrication. It is shown that in many instances lubrication needs can be met by synthetic oils having exceedingly low volatilities, but that at temperature extremes {{the only means of}} reducing friction and wear is by solid lubrication. As the demands placed on space engineering increase, innovatory approaches will be needed to solve future tribological problems. The direction that future developments might take is anticipated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Amongst a broad {{group of}} {{engineering}} ceramic materials which combine low density with very good mechanical properties {{in a wide}} temperature ranges, nitrides are of particular importance. <b>Tribological</b> <b>component</b> materials demanding high reliability in the use are presently available and might be applied in various severe wear, thermal and mechanical applications.

An attempt has been made to study the effect of wear parameters like applied load, sliding speed and sliding distance on the dry sliding wear of Silicon nitride ceramics. Wear tests of the Silicon nitride ceramics are carried out on pin-on-disc wear testing machine by varying the sliding speed (1 m/s, 2 m/s and 3 m/s), sliding distance (600 m, 1000 m, 1200 m, 1500 m and 1800 m) and applied load(20 N, 30 N and 40 N).

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, the National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton (nCATS) {{undertook}} a UK-wide industrial tribological survey {{in order to assess}} the explicit need for tribological testing within the UK. The survey was designed and implemented by a summer intern student, Mr Simon King, under the supervision of Drs John Walker and Terry Harvey and supported by the director of nCATS, Professor Robert Wood. The survey built upon on two previous tribological surveys conducted through the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) during the 1990 ’s. The aim was to capture a snapshot of the current use of tribological testing within UK industry and its perceived reliability in terms of the test data generated. The survey also invited participants to speculate about how UK tribology could improve its approach to testing. The survey was distributed through the nCATS industrial contact list, which comprises of over 400 contacts from a broad spectrum of commercial industries. The Institute of Physics (IOP) tribology group also assisted by distributing the survey to its membership list. A total of 60 responses were received for the survey, out of which 39 had fully completed the questionnaire. Participants came from a broad spread of industrial backgrounds, with the energy sector having the highest representation. Only 40 % of respondents were dedicated tribologists/surface engineers, again reflecting the multi-disciplinary nature of the field. It was found that the companies that had the highest annual turnover also appeared to expend the most on tribology. The majority of respondents indicated that as a percentage of turnover tribology accounted for less than 1 %, however the lack of hard figures only for tribology make this a conservative estimate. The greatest concern in relation to tribology of those who responded was the cost; however the influence of legislation and product reliability were also driving factors. Abrasive wear was still considered the number one tribological wear mechanism, with sliding contacts ranking as {{the most common type of}} wear interface. Metallic and hard coated surfaces were the most commonly encountered type of material suffering from tribological wear phenomena. Laboratory scale testing was a significant part of introducing a new <b>tribological</b> <b>component,</b> however component specific testing was considered the most reliable form of testing a new component over standardised test geometries. Overall there appeared to be much potential for improving the reliability of tribological test data, with most respondents indicating that simply more testing was not the best perceived approach to improving tribological data but rather more reliable, representative tests with improved knowledge capture. Most companies possessed an internal database to assist them with tribological information; however, many also expressed a strong desire for the use of a commercial or national database, although the format this might take was less clear. Opinions appeared split as to whether there would be a collective willingness to contribute to a centralised database, presumably on the grounds on the sensitivity of data...|$|E

Most marine renewable energy conversion systems require <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> to covert wind or tidal streams to rotational motion for generating electricity while wave machines typically use oscillating hinge or piston within cylinder geometries to promote reciprocating linear motion. This paper looks at the tribology of three green marine energy systems, offshore wind, tidal and wave machines.

40|$|Engine {{developers}} and lubricant formulators are constantly improving {{the performance of}} internal combustions engines by reducing the power losses and emissions. The majority of the mechanical frictional losses generated in an engine {{can be attributed to}} the main <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> of an engine, the valve train, piston assembly and engine bearings. However no single method has been developed to measure the friction loss contribution of each component simultaneously in a firing engine. Such results would be invaluable to the automotive/lubricant industries, research institutions and for validating predictive mathematical models for engine friction. The main focus of the research reported in this thesis was to validate an engine friction mathematical model called FLAME, developed in a separate study at Leeds. The validation was achieved by experimentally characterising the frictional losses generated from the major <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> of a single cylinder gasoline engine. A novel experimental system was developed to evaluate experimentally, frictional losses in all the three main <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> of an engine under fired conditions. A specially designed pulley torque transducer was used to measure valve train friction whereas improved IMEP method was adopted to measure piston assembly friction. For the very first time bearing friction was determined experimentally in a fired engine indirectly by measuring total engine friction. The FLAME engine friction model predicted valve train friction of the same order as the experimental data at engine speeds of 1500 rpm and above. However, there was a much-reduced sensitivity to engine speed and temperature in the predictions. The piston assembly predicted results correlated very well with the measured data especially at lubricant inlet temperature of 80 °C whereas for the bearing friction, the predicted results obtained with the short bearing approximation for the 1 t film case were very close to the measured values. Overall the predicted total engine power loss results showed a good correlation with the experimental data especially at high lubricant inlet temperatures and engine speeds. It was concluded that the predicted results were in good agreement with the experimental results and the comparison validated the FLAME engine friction model...|$|R

The current study addresses the tribochemical phenomena involved in micropitting in tribocorrosion systems where different levels of dissolved-water are present in a model lubricant. In this study the effect of different temperatures, water concentrations and relative humidities have been investigated on micropitting under rolling-sliding contacts. The influence of free and dissolved water on tribocorrosive micropitting is clarified.

40|$|Abstract: Historically, space {{mechanism}} lubricant {{choices were}} based on space heritage {{rather than on the}} latest technology or best available materials. With the limited mission lives and minimal duty cycles of the early space programme, this strategy was highly successful. As missions extended, other spacecraft components, such as electronics, batteries, and computers, failed before lubricated mechanisms; however, during the 1980 s and 1990 s, these ancillary components vastly improved and tribological systems became a main factor limiting spacecraft reliability and performance. Although <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> represent {{only a small fraction of}} the spacecraft’s cost, they are often single-point failures that cripple or debilitate expensive spacecraft.

The effects of other additive components, such as dispersants, that are prevalent in a lubricant additive package on the anti-wear layer remain relatively unknown. Polyisobutenyl Succinimide (PIBSI) dispersants were evaluated for their interactions with the ZDDP antiwear component.

In this work {{we report on the}} fabrication of CVD diamond components of non-planar shape. These devices were fabricated in a negative replication approach on mechanically structured substrates. Using this technique cylindrically shaped diamond devices with smooth surfaces were produced by using the nucleation side of the diamond layers as the exposed surface, thus making subsequent polishing steps unnecessary. Applying an improved two-step nucleation method further reduced surface roughness. Sensing elements in the form of resistors made from boron-doped CVD diamond were integrated into the device surface.

The pressure distribution and load carrying capacity for a single three-dimensional dimple, representing the LST, were obtained via two different methods of analysis: a numerical solution of the exact full Navier-Stokes equations, and an approximate solution of the much simpler Reynolds equation. Comparison between the two solution methods illustrates that, despite potential large differences in local pressures, the differences in load carrying capacity, for realistic geometrical and physical parameters, are small. Even at large clearances of 5 % of the dimple diameter and pressure ratios of 2. 5 the error in the load carrying capacity is only about 15 %. Thus, {{for a wide range of}} practical clearances and pressures, the simpler, approximate Reynolds equation can safely be applied to yield reasonable predictions for the load carrying capacity of dimpled surfaces. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2148419...|$|R

A 2 -dimensional finite element model using cohesive zone elements was developed to predict cracking in thin film coating – interlayer – substrate systems that are subjected to tensile loading.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} an {{experimental study of}} an elastohydrodynamic contact under insufficient lubricant supply. Theoretical studies published in this research area focus mainly {{on the development of}} theoretical models and there is an insufficient number of experimental studies which validate these models.

The thin hard coats used were titanium nitride films deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering of metallic titanium. High contact stress, low speed tests showed wear rate reductions of one or more magnitude, even with films a few micrometers in thickness. Low contact stress, high speed tests carried out under rather severe test conditions showed that thin films of TiN afforded significant friction reduction and wear protection. Thin hard coats were shown to improve the friction and wear performance of rolling contacts. Satisfactory film-to-substrate adhesion strengths can be obtained with reactive magnetron sputtering.

Metallurgical EngineeringTitanium alloys exhibit poor {{tribological}} characteristic {{which include}} abrasion resistance, metal to metal wear resistance and solid particle erosion and cavitation due to low surface hardness and high coefficient of friction. These poor properties have limited {{the application of}} titanium alloys as engineering <b>tribological</b> <b>components,</b> tools and parts that operate in severe wear and friction conditions. Laser processing defects such as pores, cracks and segregation pose a huge threat to the quality and the microstructure of the deposited layer.

The success of habitats and vehicles on the Moon and Mars, and ultimately, of the human exploration of and permanent human presence on the Moon and Mars, are critically dependent on the correct and reliable operation of many moving mechanical assemblies and <b>tribological</b> <b>components.</b> The coefficient of friction and lifetime of any lubricant generally vary with the environment, and lubricants have very different characteristics under different conditions. It is essential, therefore, to select the right lubrication technique and lubricant for each mechanical and tribological application. Several environmental factors are hazardous to performance integrity on the Moon and Mars. Potential threats common to both the Moon and Mars are low ambient temperatures, wide daily temperature swings (thermal cycling), solar flux, cosmic radiation, and large quantities of dust. The surface of Mars has the additional challenges of dust storms, winds, and a carbon dioxide atmosphere. Solid lubricants and coatings are needed for lunar and Martian applications, where liquid lubricants are ineffective and undesirable, and these lubricants must perform well in the extreme environments of the Moon, Mars, and space, as well as on Earth, where they will be assembled and tested.

40|$|Online fault {{diagnostic}} {{technologies are}} fast emerging for detection of incipient faults on <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> to avoid catastrophic failure. Vibration analysis {{has long been}} used to detect machine faults, but is sensitive to relatively severe conditions only. Electrostatic monitoring is a newly developed approach {{with the potential to}} detect precursor processes that indicate contact distress and wear. Recently, at the University of Southampton, both vibration and electrostatic sensors were implemented on a bearing testing rig to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting bearing faults. The results indicate that both types of sensor are sensitive to bearing deterioration shortly before complete failure. However, univariate plots of signals from both types of sensor only exhibit significant change when entering the severe wear stage. Therefore, multivariate techniques for detecting wear severity of components at different running stages need investigating. In this study, an unsupervised training method, called mixture-model-based clustering, that utilizes the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to develop further a wear detection technique. The choice and extraction of significant features from both vibration and electrostatic sensors are discussed as step one. The second step uses the clustering method to examine the behaviour of the extracted features during different running stages, and to quantify how good the sensors are at distinguishing wear severity. In the third step, a dynamic wear detection process is simulated. Clustering is applied to baseline data from a known healthy bearing and data from different wear stages to see if the data naturally group by wear condition. The result shows that the unsupervised clustering method is able not only to learn and detect wear conditions of the rolling element bearings with the developed statistical monitoring charts of occupation probability (OP) in the clusters and number of the trained clusters (NC), but also to obtain the advantage of detecting insignificant abnormalities that might be overlooked in the conventional plots...|$|R

The blended fuels consist of 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % coconut oil (COIL) (in volume basis) with diesel fuel (DF 2). Pure DF 2 was used for comparison purposes. The engine was operated at constant speed of 2000 rpm with 50 % throttle load {{for a period of}} 100 hours for each test fuel. The engine was operated for a total period of 600 hours for six fuels. The same lubricating oil equivalent to SAE 40 was used for all the fuels system. The sample of lube oil was collected through a one way valve connected to the crankcase sump at 50 hour intervals. The first sample was collected immediately after the engine had warmed up. The effect of blended fuel on engine component wear and lubrication characteristics in terms of viscosity, total base number (TBN), moisture content, oxidation, wear metals, contaminant elements and lubricant additive depletions were analyzed. The results showed that wear metals, contaminant elements increase with increasing COIL with DF 2. An increasing COIL in blends reduces additive elements; and the reduction rate during blends of up to 30 % COIL is quite similar to DF 2. Soot and sulfation reduce with increasing COIL in blended fuels due to reducing aromatics and sulfur in comparison to DF 2. The water concentration increases from above 30 % COIL blended fuels. The TBN and viscosity changes are found almost normal. The engine did not have any COIL blended fuels.

40|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a {{chemically}} inert, low outgassing, high {{melting point}} polymer that has the lowest friction coefficient of any bulk polymer; however, its high wear rate limits its use as a bulk tribological material. Composites of PTFE and alpha phased alumina particles produce extraordinarily low wear rates that can be more than four orders of magnitude less than the wear rates of virgin PTFE. This reduction in wear cannot be explained by traditional mechanical mechanisms. The goal {{of this research is}} to understand the mechanism responsible for the ultralow wear behavior of these composites. An understanding of the mechanisms will allow for the design of smarter, ultralow wear materials. Several experimental routes were taken to explore the system. Numerous fillers of various chemical identities, phases, shapes and sizes were added to PTFE to observe their effects on the wear properties of PTFE and compare them to understand what makes an ultralow wear filler material. Characterization was performed on the various fillers to determine why some produce ultralow wear composites with PTFE and others do not. Running film and transfer film thickness, morphology and chemistry were studied to provide valuable insight into the behavior of these composites. These studies prompted the hypothesis of a role of tribochemistry in generating low wear. The effects of environmental oxygen and humidity on the tribological performance of PTFE/alumina composite and PTFE samples were studied. It was found that wear rate of PTFE/alumina composites is dependent on the humidity of the environment. This dependence further suggests that a tribochemical mechanism is responsible for the ultralow wear behavior of these PTFE/alumina composites. Further understanding of these mechanisms promoted the design of low friction, ultralow wear solid lubricant systems, which are becoming increasingly important as <b>tribological</b> <b>components</b> are a premium for designs for efficiency and sustainability.

40|$|Friction at {{contacting}} surfaces in relative motion {{is a major}} source of parasitic energy loss in machine systems and manufacturing processes. Consequently, friction reduction usually translates to efficiency gain and reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, friction at surfaces eventually leads to wear and failure of the components thereby compromising reliability and durability. In order to reduce friction and wear in <b>tribological</b> <b>components,</b> material surfaces are often hardened by a variety of methods, including conventional heat treatment, laser surface hardening, and thin-film coatings. While these surface treatments are effective when used in conjunction with lubrication to prevent failure, they are all energy intensive and could potentially add significant cost. A new concept for surface hardening of metallic materials and components is Friction Stir Processing (FSP). Compared to the current surface hardening technologies, FSP is more energy efficient has no emission or waste by products and may result in better tribological performance. FSP involves plunging a rotating tool to a predetermined depth (case layer thickness) and translating the FSP tool along the area to be processed. This action of the tool produces heating and severe plastic deformation of the processed area. For steel the temperature is high enough to cause phase transformation, ultimately forming hard martensitic phase. Indeed, FSP has been used for surface modification of several metals and alloys so as to homogenize the microstructure and refine the grain size, both of which led to improved fatigue and corrosion resistance. Based on the effect of FSP on near-surface layer material, it was expected to have beneficial effects on friction and wear performance of metallic materials. However, little or no knowledge existed on the impact of FSP concerning friction and wear performance the subject of the this project and final report. Specifically for steel, which is the most dominant tribological material, FSP can replace the current conventional surface hardening techniques used for friction and wear performance. Friction Stir Link Inc. (FSL) is teamed with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to develop and optimize FSP for friction and wear performance enhancement. The ultimate goal is to offer FSP and an effective alternative to some of the current energy intensive and high-cost surface hardening processes...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop novel nanocomposite PVD coatings for magnesium alloys, to improve their wear and corrosion resistance – and thereby explore the potential to extend the use of such alloys to moving parts for light-weighting of <b>tribological</b> <b>components,</b> where the potential for cumulative weight savings is immense if key parts can be made from magnesium, but the alloys cannot currently be used successfully due to their poor wear and corrosion behaviour under dynamic loading. The work comprises two main stages. The first stage was to produce a base layer for subsequent PVD ceramic nitride (or nitrogen-doped hard metallic) coating deposition. The second stage was to deposit a nanocomposite coating with improved tribological performance, by introducing sequentially nitrogen reactive gas, subsequent to the base layer preparation step. In the first stage, sixteen AlCuMoMgZrB PVD coating layers were prepared by pulsed direct current closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering. Four deposition runs were carried out, with substrate negative bias voltages of 50 V, 60 V, 75 V and 100 V being applied. For each deposition run, four proprietary WE 43 magnesium alloy substrates were placed at different positions (P 1 -P 4) on the substrate holder, between AlMgB and ZrMoCu composite sputter targets mounted at 90 ° to each other. Investigations into composition, microstructure, mechanical and electrochemical properties were then carried out, to select the most suitable base layer. The P 1 - 60 layer (i. e. deposited at P 1 position, closest to the AlMgB composite target, with substrate negative bias of 60 V) was chosen as the most suitable candidate amongst the sixteen AlCuMoMgZrB coating layers due to its superior mechanical properties, electrochemical properties, and amorphous microstructure. In the second stage, four novel AlCuMoMgZrB(N) nanocomposite PVD coatings with different nitrogen reactive gas flow rates (i. e. 5 sccm, 10 sccm, 15 sccm and 20 sccm), introduced partway through the sputter deposition process, were produced sequentially, on top of the selected P 1 - 60 base layer.

Thesis also discusses methods of measuring the hard coatings wear. These methods are important to determine the properties of coating layers and their subsequent use. A lot of testing methods offer sufficient possibilities to test various mechanisms of wear in variety of laboratory conditions. Additionally in the end of the thesis there is an experimental wear measurement of specimen on tribometer using the "Pin on disc" method. Both size and type of the wear are evaluated by profilometer...|$|R
40|$|A radial piston {{hydraulic}} motor has several components that encounter sliding orrolling motion under lubricated conditions. When a hydrostatic, hydrodynamic orelastohydrodynamic oil film separates the interacting surfaces, the wear and frictionare low provided {{of course the}} hydraulic fluid is free from the presence ofcontaminants. Mixed lubrication may occur even at relatively high speed when usinglow viscosity fluids and may result in increased friction which adversely affects theoperating efficiency of the {{hydraulic motor}}. Additionally, the increased heataccumulation at different interfaces of the motor under extreme operating conditionsinvolving high pressures, high speeds and low viscosities {{can also lead to}} unstoppablethermal process resulting in seizure. At low speeds, different tribological pairs operatein boundary lubrication regime and are prone to wear. The associated high friction canalso result in low starting efficiency. The research work reported here has thus focussed on addressing the above mentionedquestions so as to improve understanding of the tribological phenomena and find waysfor improving and alleviating hydraulic motor <b>tribological</b> <b>components.</b> The results have shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce both the boundary friction and thelift-off speed through proper choice of surface modification methods and theirapplication on motor components. The running-in aspect is also very important for the satisfactory tribologicalperformance of the motor. An optimal running-in can improve surface roughness andconformity of motor components. The studies have shown that the use of DLC andphosphate coatings can be effective in accomplishing these. It may however also bekept in mind that during the initial sliding (running-in) the machine components aresusceptible to wear and roughening of the surfaces. The conformity and roughness ofthe surfaces of the sliding components are important for the lift-off speed and this alsoinfluences both the seizure resistance and overall efficiency of the motor. Threeprocesses give rise to the occurrence of seizure in a hydraulic motor and these havebeen identified as: friction heat generation during operation in mixed lubricationregime, friction heat generation during operation in full film lubrication regime andentrapment of wear particles between sliding surfaces. The initiation of scuffing on alocal scale has been found to be dependent on interface temperature rather than on thepv-value. There are several polymeric materials that are suitable for journal bearing applicationsin hydraulic motors. The PTFE based polymeric materials have the potential to reducebreak away friction by an order of magnitude. However, after running-in at 100 MPacontact pressure their low coefficients of friction have been found to increase. The simulation of a hybrid journal bearing including influence of surface roughnesshas shown good correlation with practical measurements in component test rig inlubrication regime ranging from full film down to boundary lubrication.

40|$|Surface {{engineering}} {{refers to}} a wide range of technologies that design and modify the surface properties and characteristics of components. The applications are very broad from macro to nano and from extremely hard materials to polymeric coatings. The uses are found in many engineering, energy, gas and oil, transport, medical, cosmetic, optical, chemical and sports industries. Research in this technology is ongoing and the benefits that can be derived are enormous. The design, wear and <b>tribological</b> properties of <b>components</b> for instance have been greatly enhanced by surface engineering and the economic benefits to industries far outweigh the cost and use of traditional materials. Surface coatings and surface modification as illustrated in Figure 1. represent two key methods of surface deposition.

40|$|Rolling contact fatigue is a {{stochastic}} mode {{of material}} failure experienced in <b>tribological</b> machine <b>components</b> such as rolling element bearings. The fatigue lives of effected components are significantly dispersed {{on account of}} the interaction of highly localized contact loading with heterogeneous microstructure features. Contact conditions often warrant the use of two-dimensional simplifications of the applied loading in investigations of rolling contact fatigue. However, finite three-dimensional characteristics of the microstructure can significantly influence the failure initiation and progression, thereby impacting the resulting fatigue lives. Recognizing this connection, this dissertation presents a three-dimensional modeling approach for investigating rolling contact fatigue in the framework of finite element analysis. The approach directly considers the internal microstructure topology by modeling assemblies of material grains as randomly constructed Voronoi tessellations. These topological models are utilized in conjunction with damage mechanics and a novel mesh partitioning algorithm to simulate the gradual material degradation from crack initiation through propagation to final failure. Two additional sources of randomness are studied: (1) spatial variation of material properties and (2) the presence of inherent material flaws. Constructing the model in a three-dimensional framework incurs a substantial increase in computational expense; however, several solution strategies are developed and implemented to offset these costs. The results are demonstrated to be in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with published empirical data. The failure progression begins at multiple isolated subsurface locations prior to the linking and branching of fatigue cracks that breach the contact surface. The scatter in the resulting fatigue lives is shown to be consistent with experimental findings and is well characterized by two and three-parameter Weibull distributions. Fatigue lives are found to follow an inverse power law relationship with the maximum contact pressure and parametric studies with input material parameters is carried out to develop a new rolling contact fatigue life equation for three-dimensional line contacts. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{machining}} as well {{as material}} developments increase the <b>tribological</b> requirements on <b>components</b> and tools for future applications and products. To meet these requirements, amorphous diamond-like carbon (DLC) and crystalline diamond coatings have been developed and are now entering the market. DLC coatings are deposited with different physical vapor deposition techniques on industrial scale. They show high wear resistance and low friction coefficients. Modification of these coatings is achieved by incorporation of additional elements during growth, leading to the varation of properties like surface energy, temperature stability, wear resistance and friction. These modifications are used to optimize amorphous carbon coatings for different applications. This will be demonstrated for driving elements, motor components and forming tools. Grystalline diamond coatings prepared by activated chemical vapor deposition (CVD) exhibit extreme wear resistance. Prototypes of CVD diamond tools prepared with a large scale hot-filament activation process are successfully used for high speed dry cutting of aluminium silicon alloys, for precision grinding of ceramics and midro machining of silicon and glass. Despite there are still problems with deposition and adhesion of diamond especially on cemented carbide tools, CVD diamond tools for special machining operations like graphite and green compact cutting are on the market...|$|R
40|$|Nickel alloys have wide-spread {{applications}} in mechanical, <b>tribological</b> and corrosion <b>components</b> such as clutches, cylinder liners, pistons in {{the automotive industry}} and marine components in sea water owing to its relative corrosion resistant & good thermal conductivity. The presence of silicon results in reduction of the co-efficient of thermal expansion of nickel & produces an alloy with good casting machining & corrosion characteristics. Further it is reported that addition of silica, improves the mechanical properties {{which in turn has}} profound influence on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of Nickel-SiO 2 alloys. Therefore an investigation in the present research will be made to fabricate and evaluate the microstructure, corrosion of chilled composites consisting of nickel matrix and fused SiO 2 particles as the reinforcement (size 40 - 150 µm) in the matrix. The reinforcement being added ranges from 3 to 12 wt. % in steps of 3 %.

40|$|The {{need for}} more {{components}} that are more resistant to wear and corrosion has promoted a growing interest in surface engineering. The search for improved tribological properties in mate-rials contributes {{to the development of}} processes that extend the useful life of components and their applications in increasingly severe environments. In this respect, thin ceramic coatings have been used to enhance the <b>tribological</b> properties of <b>components</b> that operate under these condi-tions. However, new experimental assays are needed to assess the behaviour of these films and their surface as substrate. These experimental analyses require the use of sophisticated equip-ment and specialized personnel. On the other hand, with advances in computational mechanics, the application of numerical analysis to solve numerous technological problems has been increa-singly frequent, owing to its low operational costs. This study aims to simulate an indentation as-say with spherical penetrator in systems composed of thin ceramic film deposited on metallic substrate using a Finite Element commercial code.

40|$|In {{studies of}} tribo-corrosion, the {{degradation}} of bio-materials has become of increasing research interest in recent years. This is because, in many cases, the interactions of the <b>tribological</b> and corrosion <b>component</b> in biological environments are not well understood. Moreover, {{the wide range of}} variables involved in the tribo-corrosion process, and the variety of materials used in such conditions, means that there are few systematic studies where materials and operating conditions are optimized. In the total replacement of hip joints, the Co-Cr/UHMWPE couple has been used widely. However, the application of any replacement joint for biological conditions will depend on many factors including the activity of the patient and the overall load imposed on the artificial joint. This means evaluation of the tribo-corrosion behaviour over a multi parameter space is important in order to assess the degradation possible for many patient/activity and body mass categories. In this work, the performance of a Co-Cr/UHMWPE couple was evaluated in Ringer's solution in a tribological situation where micron size particles particles were entrained in the contact - micro-abrasion-corrosion. The effects of applied load and potential were investigated in the study. Micro-abrasion-corrosion maps were constructed for the material indicating the mechanism of degradation, the extent of wastage and of synergy/antagonism involved in the tribo-corrosion interaction...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} and improve a {{finishing}} process that allows reduced CO 2 emissions, through reduced use of carbon-based fuels, achieving improvement in fuel consumption. The improved microfinishing process will provide a reduction in surface friction on bearing surfaces and improve wear resistance of the components.

The micro finishing development will focus on a novel polishing process using abrasive tape to achieve nanometre level surface finish. It was noticed that such a process can dramatically improve <b>component</b> <b>tribological</b> performance, which have great impacts on energy consumption and CO 2 emission. It is an urgent requirement to investigate the material removal mechanism of micro finishing process so that the quality of finishing surface can be improved consistently and effectively. Significant challenges include (a) detailed knowledge of nano-material removal, (b) understanding the tribological behaviours in relation to surface topography and surface compound created under micro finishing process, (c) the strategy of selection of micro finishing conditions for optimum surface, (d) the selection of suitable sensing techniques for process monitoring and control, (e) establishment of relationship between polished surface topography and CO 2 emissions...|$|R
