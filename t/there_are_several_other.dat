5|$|The name Burnham {{is derived}} from Burnhamm, {{as it was called}} in the will of King Alfred, made up from the Old English words Burna meaning stream and Hamm for enclosure. On-Sea was added later as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> towns of the same name in England.|$|E
5|$|Sulphur Creek Reservoir is {{the primary}} {{recreational}} facility in the watershed and {{is said to be}} one of the largest fisheries of Southern Orange County. The lake is annually stocked with bluegill, catfish, and bass. Aside from the reservoir, there is no body of water in the watershed that is navigable. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> parks in the watershed; these are Crown Valley Park, Sulphur Creek Park, and others.

5|$|The main {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is agricultural land, which accounts for 62.97 {{percent of the total}} area. 31.49 percent of the watershed is forested and 5.54 percent is developed land. Most of the forested land is on the watershed's southern and eastern edges, but there are some patches of it elsewhere, most of which are fairly small. Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> small areas of development in the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{undergraduate}} {{student body}} (Junior Common Room or JCR) {{is governed by}} an elected Executive Committee headed by the Senior Man (even when a female student holds the role) and supported by several other officers.

The Senior Man meets regularly with college and university authorities to represent the JCR.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> formats {{used for}} bouldering {{competitions}}.

In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E

George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel in addition to his tomb outside; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it, and there are Coade stone embellishments. Other carved tablets, such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer, are by obscure London-based mid-19th-century sculptor T. Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops once {{daily in}} each {{direction}} at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Station. Ridership on the train is increasing, about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. Increased ridership has prompted southern Minnesota leaders to plan for an expansion of Amtrak's service in the area. Saint Paul {{is the site of}} the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> small yards located around the city.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} Parish church, St Andrew (see Landmarks), <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> {{religious}} sites. The Roman Catholic church, Saint Boniface, {{was built}} in 1929 by Manuel de las Casas who was descended from the uncle of Bartolomé de las Casas. The Methodist church in New Cut is the third chapel on the site. The first was started in 1764 and the current building was built following a fire in 1872 which did serious damage to the chapel built in 1806. The Unitarian chapel on Pound Square dates from 1913 following {{the collapse of the}} previous building in 1911. It is the oldest nonconformist congregation in Cullompton. Hebron Evangelical Church was built in 1962. The Baptist Church is the site of a meeting house erected in 1743 on High Street.|$|E
5|$|Many of Omaha's {{founding}} figures {{stayed at}} the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel. Dodge Street was important early in the city's early commercial history; North 24th Street and South 24th Street developed independently as business districts, as well. Early pioneers were buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery and Cedar Hill Cemetery. Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. The city's pioneering history is celebrated at two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E

5|$|The Land Yeo river {{flows to}} the east of the town. The North Somerset Levels to the west have been drained and farmed by generations of farmers. Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI is a 129.4 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series, which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of Coleoptera occur, amongst which are at least 12nationally scarce species and 2nationally rare species, including Britain’s largest water beetle the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> local nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{military}} sites continues from the Iron Age into the Roman period; two Roman forts in Greater Manchester are scheduled monuments {{and were the}} two main areas of Roman activity in the county. Of the nine castles in Greater Manchester, four are scheduled monuments: Buckton Castle, Watch Hill Castle, Bury Castle, and Radcliffe Tower. The last two are fortified manor houses, and although defined as castles were not exclusively military in nature; they probably acted as the administrative centre of the manors they were in. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> manor houses and country houses some with moats in the county that are protected as scheduled monuments. The Astley Green Colliery, the Marple Aqueduct, Oldknows Limekilns, and the Worsley Delph are scheduled relics of Greater Manchester's industrial history.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>other</b> {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types}} of properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E
