This took the basic RP72 Sovereign and added two short wave bands - the only Hacker set to include both FM and SW. Coverage was 10.9 to 33 metres and 27.5 to 89 metres. Electronic fine-tuning (band-spread) was provided, and switchable ISM returned to the FM band; separate switches are provided for ISM and AFC, unlike the Sovereign II where these functions were combined on one switch. A signal-strength (and battery <b>test)</b> <b>meter</b> was provided. Echoing the development of the RP72, a mains power supply was added (the RP75MB), then the FM coverage was extended to 104 MHz. With the MB models, an ATU (aerial tuning unit) was included to improve short-wave reception. The speaker fitted to the RP75 and RP75MB was the same as the RP72, but with a larger magnet.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given rapidly accumulating {{evidence}} that health literacy is correlated with important health-related measures, assessing patients ’ health literacy level is of increasing concern for researchers and practitioners. Practical limitations {{for use of}} existing health literacy measures include length of time and practitioner involvement in administration. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a brief, self-administered measure of health literacy, the Medical Term Recognition <b>Test</b> (<b>METER).</b> PARTICIPANTS: 155 participants were recruited from an outpatient cardiology program at an urban hospital. MEASURES: Patients completed measures of health literacy (METER and REALM), neuropsychological func-tion, psychosocial health, and self-report questionnaires about health behaviors. Indicators of cardiovascular health were also recorded from patients ’ medical charts. KEY RESULTS: The measure took 2 min to complete. The {{internal consistency of the}} METER was 0. 93, and it correlated highly with REALM (r= 0. 74). Regarding sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals below REALM’s cutoff for functional literacy, METER resulted in 75 % correct identifications and 8 % false positives. METER and REALM were both associated with various health-related measures (including signif-icant correlations with measures of neuropsychological function and cardiovascular health).

A survey of available literature indicated that no reported methods would meet this requirement. Electrolytic methods for generation of stibine using antimony electrodes have been previously reported (1, 2). These methods proved unsuitable because the production of stibine was either too low or too irregular. I t was found that if the antimony electrode were replaced by a 40 gauge, platinum-iridium electrode (90 : 10) in conjunction with an antimony sohition, stibine output at the cathode was fairly uniform and of the desired order of magnitude.

40|$|Introduction In the ToMPAW arm (1) we {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} a digital network in a modular prosthesis. The network was built of a number of Neuron™ microcontrollers communicating through the LONWORKS protocol (Echelon Corp.). The hand in the demonstration prototype was based on the Southampton hand. The wrist and elbow used Edinburgh Modular Arm components, with carbon fibre tubes housing geared d. c. motors. Although this was a field prototype and not a fully engineered version, it stayed in regular service for ten years, from 2001 to 2011. Method The user possessed a short humerus following traumatic amputation 20 years previously. Initial training developed muscle bulk and control of two EMG signals. Control of the two channels was not fully independent, so a ‘winner takes all’ algorithm was adopted, with the larger signal assuming control. The joints were controlled sequentially, using scapular abduction to select them with a switch built into the harness; hand, wrist rotation, elbow flexion/extension, returning to hand, and defaulting to hand after a fixed period of inactivity. The hand had sensors for touch and slip and was capable of automatically selecting precision and power grip patterns. Results The user soon mastered control of the prosthesis despite long term lack of use of the relevant muscles, and was a keen participant in the arm’s development. One observation that he made was that control appeared to be improved when the metal and carbon fibre structure of the prosthesis was touched. This suggested that electrical interference was involved, leading to further study into electromagnetic compatibility, as reported in (2). Adding a conductive plastic earth {{to the inside of the}} prosthesis socket resolved this issue without affecting safety. No problems were encountered with the network operation, which proved to be highly reliable, though occasional maintenance was needed to remedy mechanical faults. A common problem was wires breaking where they crossed joints. This was ameliorated by using an extra flexible type of cable with a large number of copper strands and silicone rubber insulation, as used for items such as <b>test</b> <b>meter</b> leads. There was also a failure of the wrist due to gearbox seizure and consequent burning out of the motor. The supply voltage to the wrist was reduced to help avoid a recurrence. Maintenance on the hand was mostly limited to changing FSR force sensors as they wore with age. The elbow was entirely reliable, needing no maintenance over the ten year period. Initially a stack of 10 NiCd cells was used, giving 12 V for the wrist and elbow motors, with a tap at 6 V, later moved to 7. 2 V, for the control electronics. The Neuron devices required 5 V and this was supplied by regulators on the controller circuit boards. Later, the cells were changed to NiMH types, with a smaller size for similar capacity. This reduced the weight of the battery pack from 550 g to 350 g. Conclusion The concept of a modular prosthesis with digital networking was demonstrated in a ten year trial. References (1) Kyberd, P.
