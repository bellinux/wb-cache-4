Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted to revoke <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament to revoke <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as Louis Riel Day was tabled.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.|$|E

50|$|On appeal, <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> for <b>the</b> minor offenses were reversed, but <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> for <b>the</b> major offense {{of first-degree}} aggravated sexual assault were upheld, with Kyle Scherzer's {{sentence}} being reduced to seven years.

5|$|His {{trial for}} {{obstruction}} of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the {{obstruction of justice}} charge, for giving an evasive {{answer to a question}} under oath. His sentence did not include prison. <b>The</b> <b>conviction</b> was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> on April 22, 2015.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It was first {{available}} from Oxford University Press via [URL] intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour is well-recognized, but less is known about the mechanisms that may explain it. This study presents new analyses from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, which examine the intergenerational transmission of criminal convictions. It then investigates mediation via psychosocial risk factors. <b>The</b> <b>convictions</b> of fathers and mothers were significantly related to <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> of their male offspring, and this was mediated via the fathers’ drug use. However, <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> of fathers were only indirectly related to <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> of female offspring via the father’s cohabitation problems. <b>The</b> <b>convictions</b> of mothers were also indirectly related to those of the female offspring through harsh parental discipline. Accurate identification of the role that psychosocial risk factors play in intergenerational pathways for males and females can inform much more effective gender-specific prevention.

2500|$|District Attorney Morgenthau {{withdrew the}} charges. Based on Reyes' confession, the DNA evidence, and the {{unreliable}} {{nature of the}} confessions, Morgenthau recommended that <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> be vacated. In light of the [...] "extraordinary circumstances" [...] of the case, the prosecutor recommended that the court vacate not only <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> related to <b>the</b> assault and rape of Meili, but also <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> for <b>the</b> other crimes that night to which the defendants had confessed. His rationale was that the defendants' confessions to the other crimes were made {{at the same time}} and in the same statements as those related to the attack on Meili. Had the newly discovered evidence been available at the original trials, it might have made the juries question whether any part of the defendants' confessions were trustworthy. Morgenthau's recommendation to vacate <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> was strongly opposed by Linda Fairstein, who had overseen the original prosecution but had since left the District Attorney's Office. <b>The</b> five defendants' <b>convictions</b> were vacated by New York Supreme Court Justice Charles J. Tejada on December 19, 2002. As Morgenthau recommended, Tejada's order vacated <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> for all <b>the</b> crimes of which the defendants had been convicted.|$|R

5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded {{the case to the}} district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of Yasui.|$|E

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E

5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with <b>the</b> <b>conviction.</b> Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
