50|$|Within {{a couple}} of years of its founding, the company's first computer, the 820, was created as a special project for one customer. SEL's early computers, such as the 810A, the 8500, and the 8600, used wire-wrap {{construction}} to create the numerous system boards and backplane (called a swingplane). Components were low-scale resistor-transistor logic (RTL) integrated circuits comprising a few transistors per chip, and core memory was used. The 840A used all integrated circuit logic. It had up to 16K of 24-bit word core memory, all directly addressable. Cycle time was 1.75 microseconds. It also had three hardware index registers, priority interrupts with 60 levels, memory parity, and memory protect. By 1967, over 30 840A systems had been sold. Software included the 840A Real-Time Monitor, a FORTRAN IV compiler, MNEMBLER Assembler, Mathematical and Utility Routine Library, and Diagnostic Routines. Supported peripherals included: disc storage (24 Mbit, removable), 45-ips 9-track magnetic <b>tape,</b> <b>card</b> reader, card punch, 300 LPM line printer, and various data acquisition interfaces.|$|E

5000|$|Initial program loading is {{typically}} done from a <b>tape,</b> a <b>card</b> reader, or a disk drive. Generally, {{the operating system}} was loaded from a disk drive; IPL from <b>tape</b> or <b>cards</b> was used only for diagnostics or for installing an operating system on a new computer.|$|R

50|$|The FP6000 ran {{under the}} control of {{operators}} executive, a simple operating system that allowed the operator using the system console to load programs from magnetic <b>tape,</b> <b>cards</b> or paper <b>tape,</b> allocate peripherals to programs and attribute priorities to running programs. Executive performed all the I/O operations on behalf of user programs, allowing allocation of different peripherals as needed.|$|R
5000|$|The disk, <b>tape</b> or <b>card</b> deck {{must contain}} {{a special program}} to load the actual {{operating}} system or standalone utility into main storage, and for this specific purpose [...] "IPL Text" [...] {{is placed on the}} disk by the stand-alone DASDI (Direct Access Storage Device Initialization) program or an equivalent program running under an operating system, e.g., ICKDSF, but IPL-able <b>tapes</b> and <b>card</b> decks are usually distributed with this [...] "IPL Text" [...] already present.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the impact of Maestro, one has to understand the way programmers worked until about 1975. They would enter their code and test data in paper <b>tape</b> or punched <b>cards.</b> After finishing the punching, the programmer would feed the <b>tape</b> and/or the <b>cards</b> in the computer.|$|R
50|$|Some other {{examples}} of secondary storage technologies are flash memory (e.g. USB flash drives or keys), floppy disks, magnetic tape, paper <b>tape,</b> punched <b>cards,</b> standalone RAM disks, and Iomega Zip drives.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, the sorted, {{optimized}} {{wire list}} is printed out {{for use by}} machine operators, {{and turned into a}} <b>tape</b> or <b>card</b> deck for the machine. Machine-readable copies of this valuable production data are often archived at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Sequential {{data sets}} are {{normally}} read or written one record {{at a time}} from beginning to end, using BSAM or QSAM. This was the only technique {{that could be used}} for <b>tape</b> drives, <b>card</b> readers / punches and printers.|$|R

40|$|I have {{investigated}} various modalities of automation of zone electrophoresis. One system {{has already been}} pre-viously described (U. S. Pat. No. 3, 896, 021). Other systems investigated {{can be divided into}} batch systems and one random-access system; the former involve separation on cellulose acetate that is supported on 0. 127 mm thick polyester (Mylar) film in the form of <b>tape,</b> <b>cards,</b> or discs. Systems in which the separation is in a direction transverse to the long axis of the tape use a typical tape width of 7. 5 cm; systems in which separation is longitudinal make use of supports of various widths, depending upon the assay rate desired. Concepts were also developed for a ran-dom-access system for automated electrophoresis, which requires no start-up time. Small Lucite cassettes are used, one for each sample. Each cassette has one surface o...|$|R

40|$|Friction {{minimization}} between {{magnetic media}} (<b>tape,</b> <b>cards,</b> drums, etc.) and magnetic transducer (heads, etc.) {{is a key}} requirement in recording systems. Results are presented for an investigation intended to eliminate previously encountered shortcomings of friction-reducing treatments by a deposition of an inert liquid film on a fully manufactured (cured) magnetic medium. The film contains no particles, represents a compound characterized by good lubricating and thermal properties, is inert {{with respect to the}} normal formulation constituents, and has low surface tension and vapor pressure characteristics. The deposited film need only be molecularly thin to impart adequate lubricating properties to the tape. The discussion covers the characteristics of the surface lubricant, method of application, and surface coated magnetic media test results. Greater than 5 million passes of the 3 M 900 tape on a loop tester are achieved with no apparent effect on the tape and with head wear decreased by as much as a factor of te...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{statement}} {{is used to}} reference data. This statement links a program's internal description of a dataset to the data on external devices: disks, <b>tapes,</b> <b>cards,</b> printers, etc. The DD may provide information such as a device type (e.g. '181','2400-5','TAPE'), a volume serial number for tapes or disks, and {{the description of the}} data file, called the [...] subparameter after the Data Control Block (DCB) in the program used to identify the file. Information describing the file can come from three sources: The DD card information, the dataset label information for an existing file stored on tape or disk, and the DCB macro coded in the program. When the file is opened this data is merged, with the DD information taking precedence over the label information, and the DCB information taking precedence over both. The updated description is then written back to the dataset label. This can lead to unintended consequences if incorrect DCB information is provided.|$|R

5000|$|The Strela's {{speed was}} 2000 {{operations}} per second. Its floating-point arithmetics {{was based on}} 43-bit words with a signed 35-bit mantissa and a signed 6-bit exponent. Operative Williams tube memory (RAM) was 2048 words. It also had read-only semiconductor diode memory for programs. Data input was from punched <b>cards</b> or magnetic <b>tape.</b> Data output was to magnetic <b>tape,</b> punched <b>cards</b> or wide printer. [...] The last version of Strela used a 4096-word magnetic drum, rotating at 6000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Seeber had {{carefully}} designed the SSEC to treat instructions as data, {{so they could}} be modified and stored under program control. IBM filed a patent based on the SSEC on January 19, 1949, which was later upheld as supporting the machine's stored program ability.Each instruction could take input from any source (electronic or mechanical registers or tape readers) store the result in any destination (electronic or mechanical registers, <b>tape</b> or <b>card</b> punch or printer), and gave the address of the next instruction, which could also be any source. This made it powerful in theory.However, in practice instructions were stored usually on paper tape, resulting in an overall rate of only about 50 instructions per second. The serial nature of the paper tape memory made programming the SSEC more like the World War II era calculators. For example, [...] "loops" [...] were usually literal loops of paper tape glued together. For each new program, <b>tapes</b> and <b>card</b> decks were literally [...] "loaded" [...] on the readers, and a plugboard changed in the printer to modify output formatting.For these reasons, the SSEC is usually classified as the last of the [...] "programmable calculator" [...] machines instead of the first stored-program computer.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the {{bit bucket}} was the {{container}} on Teletype machines or IBM key punch machines into which chad {{from the paper}} <b>tape</b> punch or <b>card</b> punch was deposited; the formal name is [...] "chad box" [...] or (at IBM) [...] "chip box".|$|R
50|$|All {{machines}} were also supplied with a Ferranti TR5 or TR7 photo-electric paper tape reader that read at 300 characters a second, and a slower Teletype paper tape printer (no speed is given, likely 110). Further input/output was offered through two input and two output channels, normally {{connected to a}} five-way switch box that allowed the operator to select which devices were fed to which channels. Magnetic <b>tape,</b> punched <b>card,</b> printers and other common I/O devices were supported through these channels.|$|R
50|$|The H200 was {{commonly}} {{used as a}} spooling computer associated with a larger Honeywell 800 series machine. The H1800-II consisted of an H1800 mainframe equipped only with magnetic tape drives and an online adaptor (OLA) connection to a satellite H200 to simulate a card reader for reading low volumes of job control cards. The LINK program running on the H200 handled the OLA, copied punched cards or punched paper tape to magnetic tape, and copied records from magnetic <b>tape</b> to <b>card</b> punch or to line printer.|$|R
