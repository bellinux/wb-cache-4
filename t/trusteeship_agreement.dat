50|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to the <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Agreements</b> for the Territory of the Cameroons under French administration of 13 December 1946, the French administration should have let floating {{the flag of the}} United Nations on the administration building in Cameroon. The French colonial administration did not respect this principle by floating only the French flag. This was not consistent with the <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreements</b> which provided that in any such territory, only the administration was entrusted to the trustee State, in that case France and the UK.|$|R
50|$|When the League of Nations {{ceased to}} exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were {{reclassified}} as UN trust territories, henceforth administered through the UN Trusteeship Council. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence.

50|$|Between 1902 and 1916, Dikwa was {{the capital}} of what the Europeans called German Borno.

Samoa also signed a friendship treaty with New Zealand. Samoa, the first small-island country in the Pacific to become independent, joined the Commonwealth of Nations on 28 August 1970.

5000|$|The compact {{came into}} being as an {{extension}} of the U.S.-U.N. territorial <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement,</b> which obliged the federal government of the United States [...] "to promote the development of the people of the Trust Territory toward self-government or independence as appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust Territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned". Under the compact, the U.S. federal government provides guaranteed financial assistance over a 15-year period administered through its Office of Insular Affairs in exchange for full international defense authority and responsibilities.|$|E
50|$|Recommendation No. 4. We {{have reached}} the {{conclusion}} that the hostility between Jews and Arabs and, in particular, the determination of each to achieve domination, if necessary by violence, make it almost certain that, now and for some time to come, any attempt to establish either an independent Palestinian State or independent Palestinian States would result in civil strife such as might threaten the peace of the world. We therefore recommend that, until this hostility disappears, the Government of Palestine be continued as at present under mandate pending the execution of a <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement</b> under the United Nations.|$|E
5000|$|The TTPI entered UN {{trusteeship}} {{pursuant to}} Security Council Resolution 21 on July 18, 1947 and was designated a [...] "strategic area" [...] in its 1947 <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement.</b> Article 83 of the UN Charter provided that, as such, its formal {{status as a}} UN trust territory could be terminated only by the Security Council, and not by the General Assembly as with other trust territories. The United States Navy controlled the TTPI from a headquarters in Guam until 1951, when the United States Department of the Interior took over control, administering the territory from a base in Saipan.|$|E
50|$|With the {{creation}} of the United Nations, the Union applied for the incorporation of South West Africa, but its application was rejected by the U.N., which invited South Africa to prepare a <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>agreement</b> instead. This invitation was in turn rejected by the Union, which subsequently did not modify the administration of South West Africa and continued to adhere to the original mandate. This caused a complex set of legal wranglings that were not finalised when the Union was replaced with the Republic of South Africa. In 1949, the Union passed a law bringing South West Africa into closer association with it including giving South West Africa representation in the South African parliament.|$|E
50|$|Following the League's {{replacement}} by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa {{refused to}} surrender its earlier mandate. The UN intended {{that it be}} replaced by a United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>agreement,</b> requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration and a definite schedule to achieve independence of Namibia. After the rise of the National Party in South Africa, it established apartheid in both areas. The Herero Chief's Council submitted a number of petitions to the UN in the 1950s calling for it to grant Namibia independence but was not successful. During the 1960s, as European powers such as France and the United Kingdom granted independence to some colonies and trust territories in Africa, pressure mounted on South Africa to do so in Namibia.|$|E
50|$|Following the League's {{supersession}} by the United Nations in 1946, South Africa {{refused to}} surrender its earlier mandate {{to be replaced}} by a United Nations <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>agreement,</b> requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration. Although the South African government wanted to incorporate South West Africa into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de facto 'fifth province', with the white minority having representation in the whites-only Parliament of South Africa. In 1959, the colonial forces in Windhoek sought to remove black residents further away from the white area of town. The residents protested and the subsequent killing of eleven protesters spawned a major Namibian nationalist following and the formation of united black opposition to South African rule.|$|E
5000|$|Determined {{to prevent}} South West Africa from {{following}} this example, South African authorities stepped up {{their efforts to}} retain control over their protectorate. When the League of Nations was dissolved with World War II and replaced by the United Nations in 1945, Pretoria refused to recognise the new Trusteeship Council for mandates. Instead, Jan Christiaan Smuts' administration insisted {{on the right to}} annexation. In 1950, the UN confirmed that South Africa's legal administration was still in force and that it could not compel the latter to open a new <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement.</b> Even after the General Assembly assumed its powers as successor to the League and revoked the mandate in 1966, South West Africa remained a de facto [...] "fifth province" [...] of its larger neighbour.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{significance}} of the South Pacific Mandate to Japan was its strategic location, which dominated the sea lanes across the Pacific Ocean and provided convenient provisioning locations for ships. During the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy began construction of airfields, fortifications, ports, and other military projects on the South Pacific Mandate islands, viewing them as [...] "unsinkable aircraft carriers" [...] with a critical {{role to play in}} the defense of the Japanese home islands against potential invasion by the United States. They became important staging grounds for Japanese air and naval offensives in the Pacific War but were lost to United States military action between 1943 and 1945. The League of Nations mandate was formally revoked by the United Nations on July 18, 1947 pusuant to Security Council Resolution 21, making the United States responsible for administration of the islands under the terms of a United Nations <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement</b> which established the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, the Northern Mariana Islands {{became part}} of the post-World War II United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). The United States became the TTPI's {{administering}} authority under the terms of a <b>trusteeship</b> <b>agreement.</b> In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) government adopted its own constitution in 1977, and the constitutional government took office in January 1978. The Covenant was fully implemented on November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents. This led to CNMI being represented in the United States (and especially Washington, D.C.) by a Resident Representative who was elected at-large by CNMI voters and whose office was paid for by the CNMI government. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ("CNRA"), approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, established a CNMI delegate's seat; Democrat Gregorio Sablan was elected in November 2008 as the first CNMI delegate and took office in the 111th Congress.|$|E
40|$|From high {{quarters}} {{has come}} {{the suggestion that}} the hydrogen bomb tests conducted by the United States off the Pacific islands, held by it under strategic <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the United Nations, contravene the customary public international law of the sea. Thus Earl Jowitt remarked in the House of Lords: I am entirely satisfied that the United States, in conducting these experiments, have taken every possible step open to them to avoid any possible danger. But the fact that the area which may be affected is so enormous at once brings this problem: that ships on their lawful occasions may be going through these waters, and you have no right under international law, I presume, to warn people off...|$|E
40|$|This study first {{considers}} the procedural requirements for proper termination and concludes that Security Council approval is required. Second, this writing identifies {{the major issues}} {{that should be considered}} if the proposed termination of the <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Agreement</b> for Micronesia is subjected to Security Council review. Two basic concerns should be the propriety of the division of the Trust Territory into four separate entities and the legitimacy of the agreements between the new governments and the United States for continuing relations as either commonwealth or freely associated states. The history of and practice under the trusteeship system indicate that the particular arrangements for commonwealth and free association statuses do not fit neatly into recognized categories of self-governance. Nonetheless, as a general matter, the arrangements are within the broader realm of acceptable relations because they reflect the free choices of the Micronesian peoples...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} history of how the Marshallese island of Kwajalein came to be naturalized as part of suburban U. S. A. amidst a Cold War context of unprecedented U. S. military imperial expansion. Since the early 1960 s the U. S. army began layering Kwajalein's coral foundation with a domesticating and familiarizing suburban landscape to help recruit and retain American workers on the island. This workforce comprised the nation's top scientists and engineers and their families who came to operate the army's missile testing program on Kwajalein. The island's predominately civilian contractor personnel have monitored incoming ballistic missiles launched at Kwajalein's lagoon from 5, 000 miles away at California's Vandenberg Airforce base {{for more than five}} decades. These Americans arriving to Kwajalein settled on an island cleared of indigenous inhabitants by the U. S. military. They came to a place {{in the middle of the}} Pacific narrated as a safe, secure and segregated American suburb. 	 	My project examines how Kwajalein's suburban transformation historically emerged alongside the urbanization of Ebeye, the nearby island housing those Marshallese displaced by the military to enable missile testing, and others migrating in search of employment on Kwajalein. I explore the relational spatial and cultural histories of Kwajalein and Ebeye as Ebeye's growing Marshallese population came to constitute a segregated, racialized labor force serving Kwajalein's American families. This project analyzes Kwajalein's suburban transformation as a local manifestation of American disavowal of empire in Micronesia historically obscured under U. N. sanction through the 1947 <b>Trusteeship</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The agreement offered a legitimating discursive terrain framing U. S. entitlement to use Micronesia to expand military power following World War II marking the rise of a U. S. military imperial industrial complex. While U. N. sanction obscured U. S. Empire on a global level, Kwajalein's transformation localized that erasure by naturalizing the island as an American space. This dissertation examines how Marshallese political leaders, landowners and workers negotiated this U. S. colonial presence and the alternative discourses they offered in framing Kwajalein and Ebeye's histories. These narratives challenged U. S. colonial land acquisition and segregation on Kwajalein through protest, testimonies and petitions during the 1960 s and through Marshallese decolonization in 1986...|$|E
