Our results report that the capital adequacy ratio of the banks declines substantially given <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios.</b> We find that participation banks in Turkey suffer more in declined capital adequacy ratio compared to conventional banks.

40|$|Abstract In 2014, the Bank of England on {{recommendation}} from the Financial Policy Committee {{carried out the}} UK variant of stress test. Eight major banks in the UK namely Barclays, the Co- operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Charter and Santander UK were included in <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> test owing to their systematic importance in the sector. While all the banks except Co- operative bank {{were found to be}} capital adequate, the Bank of England stress test did not include the efficiency level of these banks under <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenario.</b> As <b>the</b> smooth running of any economy largely depends on the efficiency of its financial institutions, especially banks, it becomes imperative to check if the banks in UK would continue to remain cost efficiency under <b>stress</b> <b>scenario.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> present study uses Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) Approach to compare the level of cost x- efficiency of banks in <b>the</b> UK when <b>stress</b> <b>scenario</b> is introduced to the macro economic variables.

40|$|To date, {{regulatory}} bank {{stress testing}} in the United States has focused on ensuring the banking system is resilient to losses in {{one or a few}} stress scenarios that involve macro-economic weakness, but it is unclear how far this resilience extends beyond <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> consid-ered.

To improve stress testing practices, this paper proposes a framework for modeling systemic risk. The framework is used to identify areas where current stress-testing practices can be improved. Based on the framework, the paper proposes a new approach for systemic risk stress-testing and recapitalization policy that ensure the banking system is robust to a wide set of shocks, but minimizes the costs of achieving robustness through better sharing of risk.

While worst case search requires numerical optimisation we show that for practically relevant cases we can work with reasonably good linear approximations to the portfolio loss function that make the method computationally very efficient and easy to implement.

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{are faced with}} the challenge to forecast future credit portfolio losses. It is common practice to focus on portfolio models consisting of a limited set of parameters, such as the probability of default, asset correlation, loss given default or exposure at default. A simple portfolio model is also used in the Basel II framework for calculating regulatory cap ital. With regard to the stability of the financial system, these models have to be approved by regulators who have an interest in a conservative assessment of the credit portfolio risk and require the stress-testing of risk estimates. The present paper is the first in its kind to develop a framework to stress the smallest build ing block, the sensitivities of risk drivers and therefore any derivative such as a risk parameter or the credit portfolio loss. As a result, estimation uncertainties as well as the correlations are taken into account.

40|$|Since {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis in 2008 / 09 there has been heightened concern about the resilience of banking systems in Southeast Asia. This paper proposes a methodology that uses a macroprudential perspective to assess the resilience of banking systems in member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It then proceeds to apply this methodology to examine the resilience of the Philippine banking system. Data on financial soundness in the Philippine banking system are utilized in a vector autoregression model to study the dynamic relationships that exist among financial and macroeconomic indicators. Using impulse response functions, a simulation of financial ratios in the banking system is conducted by assuming unlikely but plausible stress scenarios to determine whether banking system credit and capital could withstand the impact of such circumstances. In <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios,</b> the estimated impact of macroeconomic shocks on nonperforming loan and capital adequacy ratios is generally minimal. The results, however, do suggest that the Philippine banking system has some vulnerability to interest rate and stock market shocks.

40|$|A detailed, transient, three-dimensional, finite-difference {{groundwater}} flow model {{was created for}} the Mercury Valley Administrative Groundwater Basin (MVB). The MVB is a distinct groundwater basin {{as defined by the}} State of Nevada and is located partially within the boundary of the Nevada Test Site. This basin is being studied as a potential location for new industrial facilities and therefore would be subject to Nevada water-use limitations. The MVB model was used to estimate the volume of water that could be withdrawn from Mercury Valley without inducing laterally or vertically extensive water-table effects. In each model simulation, water-table drawdown was limited to a maximum of 0. 5 m at the boundary of the basin and held within the screened interval of the well. Water withdrawal from Nevada groundwater basins is also limited to the State-defined perennial yield for that area. The perennial yield for the MVB is 27, 036 m{sup 3 }/day. The one existing water-supply well in Mercury Valley is capable of sustaining significantly higher withdrawal rates than it currently produces. Simulations showed this single well could produce 50 percent of the basin?s perennial yield with limited water-table drawdown. Pumping from six hypothetical water-supply wells was also simulated. Each hypothetical well was placed in an area of high hydraulic conductivity and far from the basin's boundaries. Each of these wells was capable of producing at least 50 percent of the basin's perennial yield. One of the hypothetical wells could simulate 100 percent of the perennial yield while staying within drawdown limitations. Multi-well simulations where two or more water-supply wells were simultaneously pumping were also conducted. These simulations almost always resulted in very limited lateral and vertical drawdown and produced 100 percent of Mercury Valley's perennial yield. A water-budget analysis was also conducted for each of the various stress simulations. Each of <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> was compared to a baseline scenario where existing water-supply wells in the model domain were pumped at 2003 - 2004 average pumping rates.

In addition, drought-susceptible varieties may contribute to missing values when exposed to severe stress. Missing values, parameter estimation and prediction of genotype performance are effectively handled by mixed models (Piepho and Möhring 2006). When the mixed model and its error structure are complex it is worthwhile exploring different data transformations such that the transformation leads to a simpler analysis of the data (Piepho 2009).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many {{countries}} have suggested macroprudential supervision {{as a means}} for earlier identification and better control of the risks that might lead to a financial crisis. Since macroprudential supervision would focus on the financial system in its entirety and on major risks that could threaten financial stability, it shares many of the same goals as the financial stability reports written by most central banks. This article examines the financial stability reports of five central banks to assess how effective they were in identifying the problems that led to the recent financial crisis and what implications they might have for macroprudential supervision. The financial stability reports in these five countries were generally successful in foreseeing the risks that contributed to the crisis, but the reports underestimated the severity of the crisis and did not fully anticipate the timing and pattern of important events. While <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> tests in these reports provided insights into the resiliency and capital needs of the banks in these countries, <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> and <b>scenarios</b> tested often differed from what actually occurred and some of the reports did not consider them to be likely events.

Published laboratory data on CO 2 -saturated intact and crushed rock samples, representative of a potential target aquifer, sealing formation and fault gouge, have been used to define a scenario where different fault rheologies apply at different depths. Nucleation of fault rupture takes place at the bottom of the reservoir, in agreement with analytical poro-elastic stress calculations, depending on injection-induced reservoir inflation and <b>the</b> tectonic <b>stress</b> <b>scenario.</b> For <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> state considered here, the first triggered rupture always produces the largest rupture length and slip magnitude, both of which correlate with the fault rheology. Velocity weakening produces larger ruptures and generates larger magnitude seismic events. Heterogeneous faults have been considered including velocity-weakening or velocity strengthening sections inside and below the aquifer, with the upper sections being velocity-neutral. Nucleation of rupture in a velocity-strengthening section results in a limited rupture extension, both in terms of maximum slip and rupture length. For a heterogeneous fault with nucleation in a velocity-weakening section, the rupture may propagate into the overlying velocity-neutral section, if the extent of velocity-weakening and associated friction drop are large enough...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{increase}} in household indebtedness seen in Hungary {{in recent years}} has raised a number of questions relating to the risks of this growth and the long-term sustainability of banking portfolio quality. The continuous monitoring of risks is a task of the MNB, which stems from its supervisory role over financial stability. In order to explore the extent and structure of household indebtedness, the central bank conducted a questionnaire-based survey among indebted households in January 2007. In this article, we present the structural distribution and riskiness of indebted households as well as the effect of various unfavourable macroeconomic developments on banks’ portfolio quality and capital adequacy, based on the findings of the survey. Our findings suggest that the shock absorbing capacity of the banking sector is sufficient (i. e. the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system would not fall below the current regulatory minimum of 8 per cent) even if <b>the</b> most extreme <b>stress</b> <b>scenarios</b> were to occur.

40|$|Structural traps for {{engineered}} {{storage of}} CO 2 usually {{rely on a}} component of fault seal. In assessing the performance risk of storage sites, {{the conditions under which}} natural CO 2 and CO 2 /hydrocarbon mixtures are retained by faults is poorly known. Mechanical failure can occur by flow along the fault plane due to extension, compression or shear. Geometric juxtaposition of aquifers or lack of low permeability fault gouge can enable flow across the fault plane. It is well established that faults which are close to being critically stressed have markedly different properties with respect to both their fluid flow and geomechanical characteristics. Here we examine three case studies. In the first two, the Rotliegend Sandstone reservoirs of the Oak and Fizzy Fields in the Southern North Sea, both of which are natural fault-bound gas fields with high CO 2 content, we modify standard fault seal approaches to account for the different physical and chemical properties of CO 2 to oil and CH 4. In particular the impact of IFT and contact angle on threshold capillary pressure is investigated. Faults of both the Oak and Fizzy fields are analysed for fracture stability and slip tendency and are found to be stable (relative to present-day stresses) in all modelled scenarios and could withstand CO 2 column heights in excess of trap height. However, under detailed assessment of fault seal potential for CO 2 -CH 4 mixtures, both fields appear to be limited in column height by cross-fault leakage through carbonate layers of the overlying Zechstein Group. The third case study assessed the Captain Sandstone saline aquifer of the Inner Moray Firth. <b>The</b> in situ <b>stress</b> field was characterised using data available from hydrocarbon exploration wells. A range of potential stress fields were identified, and regional 3 D geometric mapping of the major faults was then used to assess fault stability under <b>the</b> different potential <b>stress</b> regimes. Additionally, stereographic plots of fault dip angle and strike were used to deduce the pore pressure perturbation that could cause the mechanical reactivation of faults of any orientation. This accounted for unmapped faults that might truncate the storage reservoir and its overburden. In <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> <b>scenario</b> with <b>the</b> highest differential <b>stress</b> magnitudes low overpressures in the region of 1. 5 MPa could cause the reactivation of preferentially oriented faults, whereas higher induced pressures may be supported in lower differential stress regimes. Higher overpressure would also be required to cause the reactivation of the non-optimally oriented faults. ...|$|R
