5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} ejects {{streams of}} high-energy electrons and ions (energy up <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> megaelectronvolts), which travel {{as far as}} Earth's orbit. These streams are highly collimated and vary with the rotational period of the planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.|$|E

5|$|Early {{versions}} of Slash {{were written by}} Rob Malda, co-founder of Slashdot, {{in the spring of}} 1998. After Andover.net bought Slashdot in June 1999, several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased from a few hundred <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001. Slash remains Free software and anyone can contribute to development.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres <b>to</b> <b>tens</b> of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
