5|$|Since {{the end of}} World WarII, the Ministry of Education {{has issued}} {{statements}} and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. <b>This</b> <b>desire</b> was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect {{must be given to}} it and to Kimigayo. Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. <b>This</b> <b>desire,</b> as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E

Turner discusses Van Morrison's youth in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how early experiences shaped his perceptions. Flautist John Payne was interviewed for the book, and comments {{on his work}} with Van Morrison on the album Astral Weeks. Turner discusses Van Morrison's reluctance to be interviewed or engage with the public, and includes quotes from the musician about <b>this</b> <b>desire</b> for privacy. The author discusses Van Morrison's efforts to seek out creativity, and his exploration of spirituality. The book concludes with an assessment of Van Morrison's experiences with religion.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916. The battles consumed enormous quantities of resources while achieving virtually no strategic gains on the battlefield. The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected to increase in 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while <b>this</b> <b>desire</b> may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
5|$|From the company's inception, Takahashi and Sugiura {{wanted to}} give {{creative}} freedom to pursue projects outside genre standards, in addition to hiring young staff. An early aim was to encourage younger developers to make their mark in the industry, {{which at the time}} was dominated by people in the late 30s and up. This outlook was the reason why the Xenosaga series was provided to a younger group of developers. Kojima stated that younger developers were preferred as they could bring interesting ideas to a project. According to Sugiura, a major element during the period in which Monolith Soft was under Namco was the focus on creativity. They wanted to balance this with the financial logistics of game design rather than having budgetary concerns stifle the creative flare of the staff. When talking about their Wii U projects in 2012, Monolith Soft staff member Michihiko Inaba stated that the company wanted to show that Japan could keep up with the Western market in terms of ambitious games that pushed forward the industry, comparing Monolith Soft to Bethesda Softworks in <b>this</b> <b>desire.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject of the poem appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines of the poem written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting <b>this</b> <b>desire</b> for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E

5|$|Khrimian {{was born}} in the Aygestan (Aikesdan) quarter of Van. His father, a weaver, died when Mkrtich was a child and he was brought up by his uncle, Khachatur, a merchant. The root of his last name, Khrim, is the Armenian {{language}} term for Crimea, suggests a link his family had with the peninsula. He received informal education at parochial schools of Lim and Ktuts islands in Lake Van and Varagavank, where he studied classical Armenian, history, and ecclesiastical literature. Upon returning to Van in 1842, he embarked on a journey across the region and made a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. Khrimian wished to continue his education at a European university, but <b>this</b> <b>desire</b> was never realized. He lived in Constantinople from 1844 to 1846 where he made connections with Armenian intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|The genre has {{received}} both {{a great amount}} of critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók. <b>This</b> <b>desire</b> to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop music, insulted critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics and its shunning of rock's blues roots were abandonments of the very things that many critics valued in rock music. Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so that rock and maturity were mutually exclusive. Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.|$|E

25|$|By the 18th century, {{three main}} forces were driving the {{direction}} of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. <b>This</b> <b>desire</b> for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.|$|E
