5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E
5|$|While {{sharing a}} bottle of wine with Gail, Lewis tries to kiss her. He later {{introduces}} her to his friend, Patrick (Simon Rouse), and pretends to turn down a job opportunity in Italy because he loves her. Lewis pays Patrick for his help and tells him that Gail ruined his life, so he is going to do the same to her. Lewis and Gail grow closer and begin dating in secret, although Lewis resists taking things further because of his feelings for Audrey. Lewis attempts to drive a wedge between Gail and her family, before telling her that he has been offered a new life in Italy, running a small hotel. Lewis asks Gail to come with him and she agrees. Audrey is devastated when she learns about their relationship, after catching them together. Gail takes out a £40,000 loan against her house to fund her trip to Italy, which Lewis plans on taking. He overhears Kylie speaking about a one-night stand she had with Nick and blackmails her into getting Gail's bank account password for him. Gail gathers her family together <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> Italy, but Lewis does not turn up. He instructs them by text message to watch a DVD he has made detailing his revenge plan. He reveals that he has taken Gail's money and that he deeply loved Audrey. The police later inform Gail that Lewis fled to Belize.|$|E

Soon after, Wheatley found {{a message from}} the cruise line Sitmar and {{returned}} the call, only to be roundly abused by Sitmar's furious entertainment manager; he then discovered that Sitmar had offered the band work on a London-bound cruise liner, which had left the previous week, while the band had been in Brisbane. Unable to locate them, the liner had been delayed for an entire day while Sitmar found a group to replace them. The band confronted Sambell, who denied any knowledge, but a further check with Sitmar confirmed that the deal had been arranged, but that Sambell had been caught up with Farnham's affairs and had forgotten <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

25|$|In 1864, Hubbard {{became an}} Anglican deaconess and became {{active in the}} deaconess {{movement}} after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses or teachers. She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; or Is There No Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing {{the aims of the}} movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement. She ceased active involvement with the group in 1874.|$|E
25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. She told a lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. She wanted to make out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She {{went to one of}} the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid this off. She did not go to the police <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E

500|$|That night, {{en route}} to her first visit to The Bronze, the cool hangout in Sunnydale, Buffy meets a mysterious, {{handsome}} stranger (David Boreanaz), who warns her that she is living on a Hellmouth that is about to open, and that [...] "The Harvest" [...] is coming. He also gives her a large silver cross pendant. In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: [...] "Because tomorrow you might be dead." [...] She finds Giles and tells him about the stranger. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire (J. Patrick Lawlor) in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him. She loses them and is surprised by Cordelia, nearly staking her.

500|$|In [...] "We Need To Talk About Kevin", Dean escapes Purgatory {{with the}} help of the vampire Benny, but Castiel is not with him. He later tells Sam that things got hairy near the end and that Castiel didn't make it, that he [...] "let go". While Dean doesn't elaborate, he is clearly {{affected}} by this. In a flashback scene, Dean is shown looking for Castiel in Purgatory, interrogating a vampire for his location. As a result, he meets Benny and only agrees to Benny's deal to get out if they find Castiel first and help him escape too. Castiel appears in flashbacks in the following episode, where he reveals that he fled Dean to keep him safe from the Leviathans and other monsters that are angry at Castiel, but Dean refuses to leave Purgatory without Castiel. When talking with another angel at an auction for the second Word of God tablet, Dean again states that Castiel did not make it out of Purgatory. He later escapes with the aid of an army of angels sent to rescue him – having initially remained behind as penance for his actions to stop a duo of Leviathans that were trying to attack Dean and Benny as they left Purgatory – but the other angels not only erase his memory that they were responsible for his escape, but also erase his memory of their subsequent 'check-ins' to discuss the Winchesters' actions, with Castiel forced <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the Winchesters' progress in the search for the tablet. Apparently back to full power, Castiel helps the Winchesters save Kevin from Crowley – who has been abducting future Prophets to try to find another means of reading the Word of God tablet – and destroy the tablet to prevent Crowley using it, retaining half of the tablet while Crowley flees with the other half. Afterwards, in [...] "Hunteri Heroici", Castiel cuts off his ability to listen into the other angels and decides to become a full-time hunter to avoid facing the other angels about what he has done. Castiel proves instrumental in solving the case, using his abilities to enter the mind of a man with reality warping powers, allowing Sam to bring him back to reality with a speech about not running from it. Later, at the request of the man, Fred, Castiel strips him of his powers so he is no longer a danger to anyone though it leaves him mentally damaged. Castiel, having listened to Sam's speech about running from reality as well as Fred, decides to return to Heaven to try to make up for what he did, but is forbidden by Naomi, the angel who ordered his rescue. Instead, Castiel stays to watch out for Fred for a while, but accepts that he can no longer run from what he has done.|$|E

[...] In June 1997, The Mercury News told Webb it was transferring him from the paper's Sacramento bureau and offered him a choice between working at the main offices in San Jose under closer editorial supervision, or spot reporting in Cupertino; both locations were long commutes {{from his home in}} Sacramento.
