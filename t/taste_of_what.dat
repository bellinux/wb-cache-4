5|$|In 1914, Billy Butlin {{was living}} in Toronto {{with his mother and}} stepfather, when he left school and went to work for Eatons {{department}} store. According to Butlin, one of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp which gave him his first taste of a real holidayindeed a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become a very big part of his life.|$|E
5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912. For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E
25|$|Some routes {{were closed}} during the 1950s {{to take account}} of {{changing}} transport patterns and to remove obvious route duplication. For instance, in East Anglia most of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway was closed in 1959; long-distance passenger trains on the former Great Central Railway main line ended in 1960 as a prelude to its later closure. However, the route closures were just a small <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to come.|$|E

25|$|York had {{experienced}} freedom on his adventures with Lewis and Clark. He {{was part of}} the team and he contributed just like the rest with hunting, fishing, putting up tents etc. He had crossed rivers and mountains on the expedition and had a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> true freedom is like. On the expedition he felt like a free man, and then when he returned east he was a slave again, in a world where there was slavery and bondage.|$|E
25|$|DeLoach's {{family had}} a strong {{tradition}} of Naval Service. His grandfather was a Chief Machinist's Mate in the Navy and served for 23 years from 1922 to 1945.

25|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Goodrem will embark on a national tour of Australia aptly entitled the Believe Again Tour in smaller venues than she did on her Visualise Tour. Goodrem felt that the songs on her new album lent themselves to a smaller, more intimate setting. She announced 9 dates in 7 different cities, but has since announced more shows due to a high volume of ticket sales. To date she will perform 14 shows in 8 cities. Goodrem was quoted as saying what viewers saw at the AFI Awards, regarding her remixed song and dance performance of Believe Again, in 2007, is only a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is to be expected from her new tour.|$|E
25|$|Beckham {{missed the}} next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, {{sitting on the bench}} in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to {{security}} concerns, {{it was the first time}} the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} play from scrimmage, the Steelers got a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> lay in store as Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe {{completed}} a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14-0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on {{the first play}} of the second quarter, Martin burst {{through a hole in}} the right line, dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown, the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers defensive back Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to get back in the game. But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats 24-yard line and the score remained 21-0 going into halftime.|$|E
5000|$|While Metal Underground {{were still}} on the whole {{positive}} about the album, they were critical that [...] "for as good as the music is, Vildhjarta don't do much {{to step out of the}} shadow of their main inspiration, making comparisons to Meshuggah at times a bit too accurate", though they concluded the review by saying [...] "“Masstaden” is a good album from a new band that's more <b>of</b> a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> to come, rather than a fully evolved sound. The clean vocals on [...] "Traces" [...] are a promising sign and hopefully, with time, Vildhjarta will evolve into something much greater.

5000|$|... "Soldier of Love" [...] {{has been}} {{received}} positively {{from the music}} critics, who praised the band's comeback. Pitchfork Media hailed the singer's [...] "incomparable voice, which sounds as passionately poised as it did on 1984's Diamond Life." [...] The Hollywood Reporter gave also a positive review, saying that [...] "It may be just a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> to come, but Sade's latest definitely has its listeners at attention." [...] Digital Spy rated the song four stars out of five, and described it as [...] "a bit of revelation - a rich, atmospheric pop symphony". Rolling Stone called it an [...] "amazing ballad of utter emotional devastation" [...] as well as [...] "classic Sade - a cool and collected song about falling apart," [...] and ranked the song number three on its list of the 50 Best Songs of 2010.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did {{the same thing with the}} elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1676, Malin Matsdotter {{was judged}} guilty as charged by a {{unanimous}} court on the testimonies {{of her daughters}} and sentenced to be executed. The method of execution {{was the subject of}} debate in the royal witchcraft commission, who was to decide between three alternatives; the first was the customary execution by decapitation followed by public burning of the corpse; the second was that she would be subjected to torture prior to the first alternative; and she third alternative was the she would be executed by being burned alive. The last alternative was given the majority vote. The clerical commissioner Carolinus stated in his vote that the honor of God should be regarded before the personal pain of Malin and that she should be given a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was awaiting her in Hell after having seduced so many souls to Satan; commissioners Ivar and Noreus motivated their vote by the deterring effect such a method would have upon the public and her accomplices, and commissioner doctor Urban Hjärne suggested that she be tortured with hot iron prior to the execution, which would make her unconscious and unable to feel pain, because her death would otherwise be too cruel, but the suggestion was revoked with the view, expressed by a priest, that the honour of the name of God was more important than Malin's personal experience of pain; the method was also deemed necessary as an example to the public and to her accomplices. She was instead to have a bag of gunpowder secured around her neck to make her death quicker.|$|E
500|$|The double A-side single {{was issued}} by Capitol Records in the US on 13 February 1967, and by EMI's Parlophone label in the United Kingdom on 17 February. Aside from the {{compilation}} album A Collection of Beatles Oldies, {{it was the}} first release by the Beatles since Revolver and their August 1966 single. Recalling the reaction to the new single and the expectations it created for Sgt. Pepper, music critic Greil Marcus later wrote: [...] "If this extraordinary music was merely a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> The Beatles were up to, what would the album be like?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album's title, Mars explained: [...] "I have records {{that women are}} going to relate to and men are going to relate to. So doo-wops are for the girls, and hooligans are for the guys." [...] In several {{interviews}} Mars furthered the concept: [...] "I grew up listening to my dad who loved doo-wop music", those sounds are [...] "straight to the point" [...] and simple, they rely on a [...] "beautiful melody and voice" [...] with a connection, that represents his romantic side. However, due to his young age, at that time, he liked to party which shows his Hooligans side!" [...] Mars stated in an interview with MTV News that he had been working on his debut album and it was completed by the date of the interview. His debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, released earlier in the year, gave [...] "a little <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> in store".|$|R
5000|$|When Doris Buchanan Smith {{set out to}} find a {{publisher}} for A <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Blackberries, <b>what</b> she got instead was rejection.

500|$|The {{event was}} {{considered}} a success {{not only did it}} set a new attendance record it also generated considerable exposure for both the Crunch and the AHL. The game was originally going to be aired just in New York by Time Warner Cable, but was picked up by the NHL Network for broadcast across Canada and the United States. The players and coaches appeared to enjoy the game as well. Crunch head coach Ross Yates stated, [...] "it was unbelievable. It's hard to describe". Liffiton described the game as [...] "a little <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it feels like to play college football" [...] while Picard added, [...] "I’ll do that every game {{for the rest of my}} life."

500|$|Monroe had no film roles {{during the}} first months of her {{contract}} and instead dedicated her days to acting, singing and dancing classes. Eager {{to learn more about the}} film industry and in order to promote herself, she spent time at the studio lot to observe others working. Her contract was renewed in February 1947, and she was soon given her first two film roles: nine lines of dialogue as a waitress in the drama Dangerous Years (1947) and a one-line appearance in the comedy Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). The studio also enrolled her in the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, an acting school teaching the techniques of the Group Theatre; she later stated that it was [...] "my first <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> real acting in a real drama could be, and I was hooked". Monroe's contract was not renewed in August 1947, and she returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at the studio.|$|E

500|$|Tyler Foster of DVD Talk praised both [...] "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil", noting that, {{despite the}} fact that the episodes {{represented}} only [...] "the beginning of the show's journey into direct serialization", the story-arc was nonetheless [...] "a tantalizing <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> to come." [...] Wired magazine noted it as one of the stand-outs from the Jake vs. Me-Mow DVD, calling it a [...] "three-part suite", which concluded with the third season episode [...] "Too Young". The review enjoyed the way the episode set the stage for the apparent death, resurrection, and de-aging for Princess Bubblegum, which became a major plot point in the next season. Matt Fowler of IGN praised both [...] "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil", specifically giving applause to the introduction of the Lich, noting that he is [...] "a real, grotesque villain inserted into the merely semi-dark world of Adventure Time". Fowler ended up being very happy with the two episodes, writing that they end the season [...] "strong".|$|R
5000|$|In an Alternative Press interview, Ben Bruce showed {{concern for}} the EP's reception, {{questioning}} if people will like it or not. He hopes that, due to their influence by 1980s rock music, it will have their older fans reminiscing on music they grew up on, as well as introducing their younger audience to music they may have never heard of. The reasoning behind the Skid Row covers was due to their status as [...] "timeless classics". The [...] "Sincerity" [...] and [...] "American Average" [...] remixes were done to [...] "broad the horizons and introduce people to another genre of music we love to listen to." [...] and what is to come for the remix album [...] "Stepped Up and Scratched". Including [...] "Breathless" [...] on the EP is to give fans a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> to come on Reckless and Relentless. The demo of [...] "I Was Once, Possibly, Maybe, Perhaps a Cowboy King" [...] is a [...] "version that most people won't be familiar with and that you can't buy anywhere else." ...|$|R
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and {{found that it was}} a pretty awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, and he has a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> life can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, {{and just a}} bit punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. He {{thought it was a}} smart move from Fox to release [...] "a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great way to keep the buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Coulter {{joined forces}} with {{previous}} Australian Idol contestants Paulini, Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo {{to be part of}} the all-girl singing project called Young Divas. The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's single [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] in May 2006, through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, DeAraugo stated that they are [...] "not an Idol supergroup, it's just about finding four female voices. It just so happened the four we've gone with are all from Idol. The single is just to promote the tour, just to show a <b>taste</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> will be on there, but there won't be an album". Young Divas' version of [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] peaked at numbertwo and remained in the top-ten for fourteen consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified platinum, for shipments of 70,000 copies. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's [...] "Happenin' All Over Again".
