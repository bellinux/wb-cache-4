5|$|Rivadavia was {{commissioned}} into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard, {{although it was}} not fully completed until December. On 23 December 1914, Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina. It arrived in its capital, Buenos Aires, on 19 February 1915. Over 47,000 people came out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> ship over the next three days, including the President Victorino de la Plaza. In April 1915, Rivadavia was put into the training division of the Navy, remaining there until 1917, when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division. In 1917, Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers went on strike.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{residents}} were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed or damaged, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6km) walk from the nearest road.|$|E

After relaxing on her bed, she receives {{a phone call from}} her father, who wants to have dinner with her; however, she declines by lying about still being at work. The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together. Aya later visits her father <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> kitten he buys. At the same time, her mother rings the doorbell and the family is reunited, their happiness renewed.|$|E

5|$|In North Carolina, {{hundreds}} of residents were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} Isabel Inlet. People who were not residents {{were not allowed to}} be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6-km) walk from the nearest road. Initially, long term solutions to the Isabel Inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered, though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. Coastal geologists were opposed to the solution, stating the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, about a month after the hurricane struck. The United States Geological Survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island, a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, North Carolina Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened.|$|E

A successful attempt was made on 9 July. The tracks were completed in March, but not until the trams were delivered could service start. The tramway was opened on 18 July 1924 at 18:00.
