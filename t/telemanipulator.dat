50|$|<b>Telemanipulators</b> {{have been}} used {{for the first time in}} neurosurgery, in the 1980s. This allowed a greater {{development}} in brain microsurgery (compensating surgeon’s physiological tremor by 10-fold), increased accuracy and precision of the intervention. It also opened a new gate to minimally invasive brain surgery, furthermore reducing the risk of post-surgical morbidity by avoiding accidental damage to adjacent centers.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of {{directly}} moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments; either a direct <b>telemanipulator</b> or through computer control. A <b>telemanipulator</b> is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the robotic arms carry out those movements using end-effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon {{does not have to}} be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility for remote surgery.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of passivity based bilateral telemanipulation over delayed communication channels {{is the presence of}} a position drift between master and slave robots during contact tasks; this kinematic mismatch degrades the interaction feeling perceived by the user. In this paper we consider port- Hamiltonian based <b>telemanipulators</b> and we exploit the interconnection structure of port-Hamiltonian systems to passively compensate the position drift...|$|R
5000|$|A remote manipulator, {{also known}} as a telefactor, <b>telemanipulator,</b> or waldo (after the short story [...] "Waldo" [...] by Robert A. Heinlein which {{features}} a man who invents and uses such devices), is a device which, through electronic, hydraulic, or mechanical linkages, allows a hand-like mechanism to be controlled by a human operator. The purpose of such a device is usually to move or manipulate hazardous materials for reasons of safety, similar to the operation and play of a claw crane game.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possibility}} of long-distance operations {{depends on the}} patient having access to a da Vinci System, but technically the system could allow a doctor to perform telesurgery on a patient in another country. In 2001, Dr. Marescaux and a team from IRCAD used a combination of high-speed fiber-optic connection with an average delay of 155 ms with advanced asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and a Zeus <b>telemanipulator</b> to successfully perform the first transatlantic surgical procedure, covering the distance between New York and Strasbourg. The event was considered a milestone of global telesurgery, and was dubbed [...] "Operation Lindbergh".|$|E
50|$|JET is the world’s largest {{nuclear fusion}} {{experiment}} {{on the energy}} producing process which {{takes place in the}} sun.Over time, high-energy neutrons render some components and support structures of the reactor radioactive. This was most severe after the first DT (Deuterium/Tritium) experiments on JET in 1997. Furthermore, many plasma facing tiles are covered in beryllium, which, if breathed in as dust, poses a further hazard to anyone working inside the reactor. Therefore, JET has always placed great emphasis on its Remote Handling, to ensure a maximum of tasks can be carried out fully remotely. This has always relied on the MASCOT <b>telemanipulator</b> system as the main workhorse for all remote handling activities. This remote handling has historically been done by CCFE's RH group, now RACE, RACE will continue supporting JET operating the Mascot system.|$|E

50|$|A <b>telemanipulator</b> (or teleoperator) is {{a device}} that is {{controlled}} remotely by a human operator. If such a device {{has the ability to}} perform autonomous work, it is called a telerobot. If the device is completely autonomous, it is called a robot. In simple cases the controlling operator's command actions correspond directly to actions in the device controlled, as for example in a radio controlled model aircraft or a tethered deep submergence vehicle. Where communications delays make direct control impractical (such as a remote planetary rover), or it is desired to reduce operator workload (as in a remotely controlled spy or attack aircraft), the device will not be controlled directly, instead being commanded to follow a specified path. At increasing levels of sophistication the device may operate somewhat independently in matters such as obstacle avoidance, also commonly employed in planetary rovers.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Apollo program, most space exploration has been conducted with telerobotic space probes. Most space-based astronomy, for example, has been conducted with telerobotic telescopes. The Russian Lunokhod-1 mission, for example, put a remotely driven rover on the moon, which was driven in real time (with a 2.5-second lightspeed time delay) by human operators on the ground. Robotic planetary exploration programs use spacecraft that are programmed by humans at ground stations, essentially achieving a long-time-delay form of telerobotic operation. Recent noteworthy examples include the Mars exploration rovers (MER) and the Curiosity rover. In the case of the MER mission, the spacecraft and the rover operated on stored programs, with the rover drivers on the ground programming each day's operation. The International Space Station (ISS) uses a two-armed <b>telemanipulator</b> called Dextre. More recently, a humanoid robot Robonaut has been added to the space station for telerobotic experiments.|$|E

The design is based on the S. Lee and H. S. Lee teleoperator control scheme, which is modified so as to be able to compensate the uncertainties, and is implemented using a partitioned multilayer perception neural network. Several subnetworks are used each one identifying a term of the manipulator's dynamic model. A new learning algorithm is proposed which distributes the learning error to each subnetwork and enables online training. Several simulation results are provided, which show the robustness ability by the partitioned neurocontroller, and compare it with the results obtained through sliding mode control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — During teleoperation, the {{automatic}} identification of remote environment properties {{has the potential}} of improving performance by providing task-specific feedback to the operator. Similarly, virtual training systems can be calibrated using such an automatic identification procedure. For those properties which can be described by parameterized constraint equations, this paper provides a method by which the active constraints can be determined during each portion of the remote manipulator’s data stream. The parameterized properties can then be estimated from the appropriate data stream segments. The approach is validated for peg-in-hole insertion using a desktop teleoperator system. The proposed segmentation procedure is compared with manual segmentation to estimate the geometric properties of the peg and hole.

40|$|Inspection {{and drying}} {{equipment}} has been implemented {{in a hot}} cell to address the inadvertent ingress of water into used nuclear fuel storage bottles. Operated with <b>telemanipulators,</b> the system holds up to two fuel bottles and allows their threaded openings {{to be connected to}} pressure transducers and a vacuum pump. A prescribed pressure rebound test is used to diagnose the presence of moisture. Bottles found to contain moisture are dried by vaporization. The drying process is accelerated by the application of heat and vacuum. These techniques detect and remove virtually all free water (even water contained in a debris bed) while leaving behind most, if not all, particulates. The extracted water vapour passes through a thermoelectric cooler where it is condensed back to the liquid phase for collection. Fuel bottles are verified to be dry by passing the pressure rebound test...|$|R

40|$|For many telemanipulators, it {{is often}} {{impractical}} to provide {{the same number of}} degrees of freedom for position control at the slave and force feedback to the master. Sensor/actuator asymmetries in telemanipulators are created when the user is able to position the <b>telemanipulator</b> in more degrees of freedom then the <b>telemanipulator</b> can provide force feedback. Most commonly, teleoperator asymmetries arise from the lack of an actuator on the master manipulator or the lack of a sensor on the slave manipulator. While examples of systems containing asymmetries are numerous, <b>telemanipulator</b> asymmetries ’ effect on operator performance and controller design have not been thoroughly examined. We present the necessary dynamic models of sensor/actuator asymmetries in telemanipulators. Using motivating examples and common passivity conditions, we show how these asymmetries cause “passive ” control structures to be non-passive. More generally, asymmetries demonstrate challenges in creating practical, force-reflecting telemanipulators...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{craft of}} surgery has always {{relied on the}} use of instruments. Innovations in surgery have paral-leled {{innovations}} in instrumentation. Advances in sur-gical instrumentation continue today and have enabled huge strides in surgical procedures and outcomes during this generation. Computers and related technology are now changing the interface between the surgeon and the patient, and are poised to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the surgeon’s skills and training. The application of computer enhanced <b>telemanipulators,</b> or ‘‘robots’’, may specifically enhance operations, for example Heller myotomy, that require good visualiza-tion and precise careful dissection of delicate structures. This review covers the pathophysiology of achalasia and its history of medical and surgical treatment, leading to modern robotic telesurgical approaches. Improvements in outcome from medical to standard surgical to robotic telesurgical approaches are discussed.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of successive exclusion of degrees-of-freedom within digits (thumb and index finger) and wrist when performing tasks demanding varying degrees of end effector kinematic complexity. The analysis was performed by successive constraining articulations in the fingers (thumb and index) and wrists or human subjects via splints, and then timing performance of part movement, positioning, and assembly operations requiring different levels of kinematic freedom. Analysis of performance times showed that transferring degrees-of-freedom, or articulations, from the digits to the wrist and arm had little or no material affect upon manipulation performance times if wrist and arm kinematics were unrestricted. If wrist and arm kinematics are not constrained and are of high-quality, our findings show that transferring kinematic freedom from the digits to the wrist and arms or remote end effectors offers limited or no consequence in terms of remote assembly operations. The importance of such findings, in terms of development and implementation of commercially attractive <b>telemanipulators,</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Microsystems, in {{particular}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), are widely {{applied to the}} chemical analysis of fluids in pharmaceutical screening, biochemical assays, environmental monitoring, etc. The development of these microsystem applications is mainly economically driven: a series of experiments can be performed with a much smaller amount of material and with a much shorter preparation time. The chemical analysis of radioactive products {{is complicated by the}} necessary shielding to reduce the dose uptake for the analyst. For very ¿hot¿ products with high radiation levels, either remote handling in hot cells with <b>telemanipulators</b> or extreme dilution is necessary. A radiochemist therefore uses different timescales for sample preparation and instrumentation setup. Nevertheless it seems that here also, a great benefit due to miniaturization can be expected. The scaling down of the radioactive sample means an almost proportional reduction of radiation, hence considerable simplification of the shielding measures. For sample size reduction by a factor of 1000, analysis of a real radioactive solution, for example a nitric acid solution in which spent nuclear fuel is dissolved, becomes possible in a glove-box system without the need for dilution.
