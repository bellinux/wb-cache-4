25|$|Natural {{disasters}} are {{a dramatic}} example {{of people living}} in conflict with the environment. Early predictions and warnings are essential for the reduction of property damage and loss of life. Because landslides occur frequently and can represent some of the most destructive forces on earth, it is imperative to have a good understanding as to what causes <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> people can either help prevent them from occurring or simply avoid them when they do occur. Sustainable land management and development is also an essential key to reducing the negative impacts felt by landslides.|$|E
25|$|Funding of the Crown's {{operation}} in the provinces is split between the federal and provincial governments. As the viceroy is a federal appointee, the federal Crown pays in two parts—In Capital City Expenses and Out of Capital City Expenses—for some of the lieutenant governors' costs of office; his or her salary, which, like the governor general's, is fully taxed; and, through the Department of Canadian Heritage, a superannuation to retired lieutenant governors, though this money is actually garnished off of the individual's salary during his or her time in office. The provincial coffers supply the relevant lieutenant governor for other expenses of office, travel costs, and the upkeep of official residences, amongst other necessities. However, there is no uniform way in which each province distributes the money, and the amounts will also vary, depending on the facilities available to the Queen's representative, how they are used, which departments support <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they expenditures {{are listed in the}} provincial estimates.|$|E

So Rahab asked the spies to swear by God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house and give her a token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She let them down by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. She told them to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E

500|$|Street {{newspapers}} are sold mainly by homeless individuals, but the newspapers vary {{in how much}} content is submitted by <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> much of the coverage pertains to them: while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors, others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate [...] mainstream publications. [...] These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered {{and to what extent}} the homeless should participate in writing and production. [...] One popular street newspaper, The Big Issue, has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture, whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday. The song {{features}} street-slang bravado and [...] "venomous" [...] rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses. The instrumentation in [...] "Freedom" [...] mixes together smooth ambient riffs, pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers, and a smooth R beat, creating a sonically breezy soundscape. Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame. In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers [...] "in the competition" [...] will never thank her for opening the doors for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: [...] "They'll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple." ...|$|E
500|$|William Petersen {{worked with}} the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in {{preparation}} for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they learned to [...] "compartmentalize" [...] their working and personal lives. [...] "Of course you don’t really turn it off", he recalled. [...] "At the end of the day, even if you’re just a regular policeman, it takes a toll". [...] During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as [...] "one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time". Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] was [...] "their song". This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and fifty-three seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from pop and R with downtempo beats music genres. Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> strong their love was. According to Carey, she refrained from giving away too much of the song's lyrical meaning, in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way: ...|$|E

500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E
