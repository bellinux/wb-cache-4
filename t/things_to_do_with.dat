Bringing back the monsters was Gatiss' idea, and he {{convinced}} executive producer Steven Moffat by coming up with new <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them. The Ice Warriors' costume was improved but not significantly redesigned, as the production team felt they were not well known enough. The episode was filmed in June 2012 on a submarine set, as the story is a closed [...] "base-under-siege". [...] "Cold War" [...] was watched by 7.37 million viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E
2500|$|Andy Cunningham {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} for a book that Bodger and Badger ended its 10-year run in 1999 when the Head of BBC Children's Programmes - Christopher Pilkington (who had commissioned the show in 1989 and championed it since then) - left his post and the programme was not renewed by his successors - Andy {{said that he was}} not surprised by this, but he didn't reveal why. He mentioned that he didn't mind this anyway as he said he was struggling for inspiration for <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> mashed potato {{towards the end of the}} show's run.

2500|$|The {{function}} of an admiralty court initially in the 14th century was {{to deal with}} piracy and other offenses committed upon the high seas. [...] This was a manifestation of England’s claim over {{the sovereignty of the}} seas claimed by her. [...] However, it did not take long for those early courts to seek to manifest control over all <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> shipping, such as mercantile matters. [...] This led to a running battle between the admiralty courts and the common law courts as to which court had jurisdiction over particular issues. [...] At times King Richard II and King James I were induced to arbitrate a solution to these disputes. [...] Admiralty courts were run under the Roman civil law of the time, whereas the common law courts were run under the common law procedures. [...] Litigants would prefer the simplicity of the admiralty courts over the complexities of the common law courts.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{afford to}} spend it all on Aunt Matilda," [...] said Harry {{to his mother and}} Kate, [...] "for I have other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> my money. But she's bound to have a good Christmas, and we'll make her a present besides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice enough girl," [...] {{admitted}} his lordship grudgingly. [...] "But {{a damned}} nuisance about the house; always {{at me to}} go on with the family history.

60|$|His {{pale face}} had become fervid, {{the bright light}} of the enthusiast was burning in his dark eyes. Eleanor felt that she had become once more only a unit in his eyes, a mere atom of humanity, whose {{interest}} to him was purely scientific and impersonal. She found herself trembling. What had these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> her? She was afraid of what might come. She remembered that he had spoken of death.|$|E

6000|$|I turned impatiently as one turns upon an impertinence, and beheld a great ironclad not {{four miles}} out, {{steaming}} fast across the dappled silver, and from its funnels sparks, intensely red, poured {{out into the}} night. As I turned, came the hot flash of its guns, firing seaward, and answering this, red flashes and a streaming smoke in the line between sea and sky. So I remembered it, and I remember myself staring at it--in a state of stupid arrest. It was an irrelevance. What had these <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> me? ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, accordingly, nothing of {{importance}} happened, {{from the point of}} view of the Brackenhurst chronicler; though Bertram was constantly round at the Monteiths' garden for afternoon tea or a game of lawn-tennis. He was an excellent player; lawn-tennis was most popular [...] "at home," [...] he said, in that same mysterious and non-committing phrase he so often made use of. Only, he found the racquets and balls (very best London make) rather clumsy and awkward; he wished he had brought his own along with him when he came here. Philip noticed his style of service was particularly good, and even wondered at times he did not try to go in for the All England Championship. But Bertram surprised him by answering, with a quiet smile, that though it was an excellent amusement, he had too many other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his time to make a serious pursuit of it.|$|E

6000|$|... "No one has any <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> my affairs," [...] {{said the}} poor lad; and folding his {{arms on the}} table, he laid his head upon them, with the sullen dejection of the {{overburdened}} lama, when it throws itself down to die in desperation.|$|R
