After refusing McMahon's initial offer, Sammartino was offered a {{percentage}} of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up {{for a series of}} tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at Shea Stadium. When McMahon gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> away. On September 1, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.|$|E
