5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The V or Vic {{formation}} {{was developed}} in June, which made {{a greater emphasis on}} each pilot looking for the enemy, search capability and avoiding being <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> Still, it was inferior to German fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|Only one of {{the small}} {{detachment}} of marines on board participated in the mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> to fulfill their role of shipboard police and oppose the mutineers, they did insist on being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> Kesselring moved {{rapidly to}} regain control of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E

Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba suddenly has a vision of a house flying through the sky and Nessarose being in pain. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle that his family owns that she can stay in.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{promptly}} {{responded by}} ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. Disorganized and milling about {{the bottom of}} the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> and {{by nightfall}} on 8 August the 11,000 Allied troops—under {{the command of}} Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift—secured Tulagi and nearby small islands {{as well as an}} {{airfield}} under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield Henderson Field. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000.|$|E
5|$|The fifth fort to fall, Fort Michilimackinac (present Mackinaw City, Michigan), was {{the largest}} fort <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise.</b> On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball (a forerunner of lacrosse) with visiting Sauks. The {{soldiers}} watched the game, as they had done on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.|$|E
5|$|The first Swedish {{attack on}} Frederikshald started on 14 September 1658 {{with a force}} of 1600 under Harald Stake, who falsely {{believed}} the town to be undefended. But Frederikshald was defended by two companies of the civic militia under captain Peder Olsen Normand, who had taken up {{a position on the}} Overberget hill south of the town. Detachments from the regiments of Oppland and Østfold with four cannons came to their rescue. The Swedish attackers were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and were completely defeated the day after their arrival.|$|E

5|$|An {{attack by}} sea across Lake Constance on Rheineck and Rorschach on July 21 {{was one of}} the few {{successful}} Swabian operations. The small Swiss detachment was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> the villages plundered and burnt. A much larger attack of an army of about 16,000 soldiers in the west on Dornach, however, met a quickly assembled but strong Swiss army. In the battle of Dornach on July 22, 1499, the Swabian and mercenary troops suffered a heavy defeat after a long and hard battle. Their general Heinrich von Fürstenberg fell early in the fight, about 3,000 Swabian and 500 Swiss soldiers died, and the Swabians lost all of their artillery again.|$|E
5|$|French {{security}} forces were initially <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and {{were unable to}} organize an effective response to contain the uprising. By May 1947, however, the French military had begun to counter the nationalists' attacks. Five North African battalions arrived in Madagascar {{at the end of}} July 1947, enabling the French to take the initiative. However, French army strength remained modest with soldiers numbering 18,000 in April 1947. The number of troops increased to about 30,000 in 1948. The French forces now included paratroopers, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion, and tirailleurs (colonial infantry) brought in from the French territories of Comoros and Senegal.|$|E
5|$|Milson led {{the first}} group of Beaufighters into Førde Fjord at about 4:10pm. His {{aircraft}} escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other Beaufighters followed him into the fjord. At about this time 12 Fw190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to intercept the Beaufighters that were waiting their turn to attack. The British Mustangs were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> but dived to intercept the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{was ordered}} to assault the river and capture a crossing. On 24 November the regiment, with the 8th Squadron leading, crossed the ford at the river mouth. <b>Taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> the Turkish {{defenders}} retired, and were followed by the regiment, who galloped into the nearby foothills and captured the village of Sheikh Muannis. The rest of the brigade continued the attack along the river, capturing the other crossings. To support their defence, the 161st (Essex) Brigade moved {{to the north of}} the river and dug in. The regiment sent mounted patrols forward to observe the surrounding country.|$|E
5|$|After {{the wedding}} {{the couple was}} briefly separated. Przemysł II came to Greater Poland, where {{together}} with his uncle prepared the ceremonial arrival of his wife to Poznań. Finally, together with his uncle, his aunt Jolenta, Bishop Mikołaj I of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries the prince went to the border frontier in Drezdenko, where solemnly brought Ludgarda to her new home. The alliance between Greater Poland and Pomerania was directed against Brandenburg and in 1274, resulted {{in more than one}} retaliatory expedition against Greater Poland; <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> the princes watched how without major obstacles the Brandenburg army came to Poznań, and burned the main fortress of the city. Only after this, the Greater Poland knighthood was hastily organized and was able to expel the invaders.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been neutral or undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down from the {{mountains}} and waited in hidden locations around the city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area. On {{the morning of the}} 23rd they attacked. The Rwandan forces in the area were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a {{significant}} force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron. Reaching the Sunda Strait on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of Bantam and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, {{and the rest of the}} Dutch squadron was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise,</b> mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron. By the time their mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove Phoenix ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|For months, {{workers in}} Łódź {{had been in}} a state of unrest, with several major strikes having taken place, which were {{forcibly}} suppressed by the Russian police and military. The insurrection began spontaneously, without backing from any organized group. Polish revolutionary groups were <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>surprise</b> and did not {{play a major role in}} the subsequent events. Around 21–22 June, following clashes with the authorities in the previous days, angry workers began building barricades and assaulting police and military patrols. Additional troops were called by the authorities, who also declared martial law. On 23 June, no businesses operated in the city, as the police and military stormed dozens of workers' barricades. Eventually, by 25 June, the uprising was crushed, with estimates of several hundred dead and wounded. The uprising was reported in the international press and widely discussed by socialist and communist activists worldwide. Unrest in Łódź would continue for many months, although without protests on such a large-scale as before.|$|E
