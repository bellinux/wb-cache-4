40|$|AbstractElectron density {{dynamics}} in air, nitrogen and argon femtosecond filament plasma channel is studied under different pressure up {{to hundreds of}} picoseconds after ionization by <b>transverse</b> <b>interferometry</b> method. It is revealed that initial electron density in nitrogen plasma rises significantly under the pressure over 4 atmospheres. Optical refractive index anisotropy, which precedes and accompanies ionization, related with intense pulse propagation is revealed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing {{femtosecond}} laser pulses at 800 and 400 nm, we characterize {{the formation of}} underdense channels in air generated by laser filamentation at the millijoule energy level by means of <b>transverse</b> <b>interferometry.</b> We find that using tight focusing conditions, filamentation generates a shock wave and that the resulting low-density channel lasts for more than 90 ms. Comparison of these results with hydrodynamic simulations using an Eulerian hydrodynamic code gives an good agreement and allows us to estimate the initial gas peak temperature at ∼ 1000 K. The influence of experimental parameters such as the focusing conditions for the ultrashort laser pulse, its polarization or the wavelength is studied and linked to previous characterizations of filamentation-generated plasma columns...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the two-particle interferometry for the particle-emitting sources which undergo the first-order phase {{transition from the}} quark-gluon plasma with a finite baryon chemical potential to hadron resonance gas. The effects of source expansion, lifetime, and particle absorption on the <b>transverse</b> <b>interferometry</b> radii R_ out and R_ side are examined. We find that the emission durations of the particles become large when the system is initially located at {{the boundary between the}} mixed phase and the quark-gluon plasma. In this case, the difference between the radii R_ out and R_ side increases with the transverse momentum of the particle pair significantly. The ratio of √(R_ out^ 2 -R_ side^ 2) to the transverse velocity of the pair is an observable for the enhancement of the emission duration.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed Magnetically Applied Pressure-Shear (MAPS) experimental technique to measure material shear strength at high pressures on magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) drive pulsed power platforms was fielded on August 16, 2013 on shot Z 2544 utilizing hardware set A 0283 A. Several technical and engineering challenges were overcome {{in the process}} leading to the attempt to measure the dynamic strength of NNSA Ta at 50 GPa. The MAPS technique relies {{on the ability to}} apply an external magnetic field properly aligned and time correlated with the MHD pulse. The load design had to be modified to accommodate the external field coils and additional support was required to manage stresses from the pulsed magnets. Further, this represents the first time <b>transverse</b> velocity <b>interferometry</b> has been applied to diagnose a shot at Z. All subsystems performed well with only minor issues related to the new feed design which can be easily addressed by modifying the current pulse shape. Despite the success of each new component, the experiment failed to measure strength in the samples due to spallation failure, most likely in the diamond anvils. To address this issue, hydrocode simulations are being used to evaluate a modified design using LiF windows to minimize tension in the diamond and prevent spall. Another option to eliminate the diamond material from the experiment is also being investigated...|$|R
50|$|Zernike phase-contrast {{microscopy}} introduces a phase {{shift to the}} low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase-shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample, so that high-spatial-frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low-frequency reference beam. In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts. After the specimen, the two parts are made to interfere, giving {{an image of the}} derivative of the optical path length {{in the direction of the}} difference in <b>transverse</b> shift. In <b>interferometry</b> the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror. One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a new apparatus and psychophysical technique to extend isoluminant contrast-sensitivity measurements to high spatial frequencies. The apparatus consists of two identical laser interferometers {{that are designed to}} produce phase-locked two-color interference fringes on the retina without the influence of diffraction and most aberrations in the eye. However, even with <b>interferometry,</b> <b>transverse</b> chromatic aberration of the eye can produce a wavelength-dependent phase shift in the interference fringes, which can be exaggerated by head movements. To reduce the effect of head movements, isoluminant red and green interference fringes of equal spatial frequency and orientation were drifted slowly in opposite directions to guarantee a purely isochromatic (in phase) and a purely isoluminant (out of phase) stimulus during each cycle of stimulus presentation. With this technique we found that observers could resolve red and green stripes at spatial frequencies higher than 20 cycles per degree (c/deg) (20 - 27 c/deg), substantially higher than has previously been reported. This places a lower bound on the sampling density of neurons that mediate color vision. At all spatial frequencies, even those above the isoluminant resolution limit, a relative phase of the red and the green components could be found that obliterated the appearance of luminance modulation at the fringe frequency. Above the resolution limit, red-green-isoluminant interference fringes are seen as spatial noise, which may be chromatic aliasing caused by spatial sampling at some stage in the chromatic pathway...|$|R
40|$|Slow pulsed {{capillary}} discharges {{in round}} capillaries are currently {{under investigation for}} use as plasma channel laser waveguides in laser-wakefield acceleration, x-ray lasers, and higher-harmonic generation. In this study, a capillary discharge with a square cross section is presented. The electron d., which dets. the laser guiding properties, can be measured by means of <b>transverse</b> <b>interferometry</b> in this device. Using a numerical model of the plasma and the capillary wall, an anal. of the discharge is made. The results predict that the square channel is capable of guiding circular laser pulses. The guiding properties are quite {{similar to those of}} a round channel with nearly the same diam. as the channel width. This suggests the results obtained by measuring the square capillary discharge are applicable for round channels as well. It was found that the wall heating was inhomogeneous, which makes the wall more susceptible to ablation. The heating of the wall changes the transverse optical pathlength in the interferometry expts.

40|$|Ion {{acceleration}} from solid targets irradiated by high-intensity laser pulses {{has been}} one of the most attractive areas of research in the last decade due to its widespread potential applications. In this prospective, the Radiation Pressure Acceleration (RPA) mechanism is currently attracting a substantial amount of experimental and theoretical attention worldwide. Employing the Petawatt laser of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, both the Hole-boring (HB) and Light sail (LS) regimes of RPA have been extensively explored. The dominant role of laser radiation pressure in such intense interaction conditions resulted in narrow band heavy ion spectra, where the ion energy scales with (I /) 1. 5 [I, and stand for laser intensity, pulse duration and target areal density respectively]- significantly faster than the competing ‘Target Normal Sheath Acceleration ’ mechanism (E I 0. 5). The aftermath of RPA is observed in the late time (0. 1 - 1 ns) evolution of collimated plasma jets ejected from the target rear surface, detected by ps time resolved <b>transverse</b> <b>interferometry.</b> Laser-driven ion acceleration has been a rapidly progressing field of great interest since the firs...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a detailed {{investigation into the}} process of laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) for the generation of high-energy electron beams using the hydrogen-filled capillary discharge waveguide. In only the second experiment to be performed using the newly commissioned Astra-Gemini laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, electron beams were accelerated to energies greater than 0. 5 GeV by laser pulses of energy 2. 5 J and peak power of 30 TT̃. The injec- tion and acceleration of electron beams was seen {{to depend on the}} state of the plasma channel for axial electron densities less than 2. 5 x 1018 cm - 3. With the aid of simulations performed using the code WAKE it was found that the plasma channel allows the laser pulse to maintain its self-focussed spot size along the length of the capillary even below the critical power for self-guiding. It was found that the threshold laser energy required for the production of elec- tron beams was reduced by the use of an aperture placed early in the laser system. This was attributed to the increased energy contained in the central part of the focal spot of the laser. A short paper on this work was published in Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams and a longer paper was published in the New Journal of Physics. <b>Transverse</b> <b>interferometry</b> was used to measure the electron density of the plasma channel used in the Astra-Gemini experiments. An imaging system was devised which used cylindrical optics to increase the field of view of the capillary longitudinally, whilst maintaining the trans- verse resolution. The measured properties were consistent with previous measurements made by Gonsalves et al. [J]. The observed longitudinal variations in the plasma channel parameters were not found to be significant enough to affect the injection process.
