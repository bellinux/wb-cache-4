5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> loss of <b>foliage</b> from a {{tree with}} an {{undamaged}} water conducting system can actually improve water relations on <b>the</b> remaining <b>foliage.</b> Up to 40 % of the live crown can be removed in conifers without reducing diameter growth (Heidmann 1963, Pearson et al. 1972, Wyant et al. 1986). This occurs because stomatal conductance on <b>the</b> remaining <b>foliage</b> increases relative to pre-defoliated conditions (Pataki et al. 1998, Hubbard et al. 1999). Higher stomatal conductance can result {{in an increase in}} photosynthesis per unit foliage, especially during periods of water stress. This increase in foliar productivity mitigates <b>the</b> effects of <b>foliage</b> loss. However, in the case where the stem hydraulic conductance is reduced through cavitation, stomatal conductance may not improve on <b>the</b> remaining <b>foliage,</b> thereby limiting <b>the</b> ability of <b>the</b> remaining <b>foliage</b> to maintain tree productivity (Thompson 2007). Further research on the physiological responses of trees exposed to fire will address the potential of this mechanism to offset the impacts of fire damage.|$|R

5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981â€”by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in <b>the</b> <b>foliage.</b> First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritive value}} {{and the effect}} of tannins on <b>the</b> {{utilization}} of <b>foliage</b> from three commonly used legumes, Acacia nilotica, Albizia procera, and Sesbania acculeata, were determined. Three mature rumen-fistulated bullocks were used to study in sacco degradability and twelve adult sheep were randomly allocated on the basis of live weight to 4 groups of 3 in each to study the in vivo digestibility of <b>the</b> <b>foliages.</b> In all <b>foliages,</b> <b>the</b> contents of crude protein (17 to 24 % of DM) were high. Fibre was especially high in Albizia (NDF 58. 8 % of DM vs. 21 % in Sesbania and 15. 4 % in Acacia). Contents of both hydrolysable (4. 4 to 0. 05 %) and condensed tannins (1. 2 to 0. 04 %) varied from medium to low in <b>the</b> <b>foliages.</b> Acacia contained <b>the</b> highest level of total phenolics (20. 1 %), protein precipitable phenolics (13. 2 %) and had the highest capacity to precipitate protein (14. 7 %). Drying in shade reduced the tannin content in Acacia and Albizia by 48. 6 and 69. 3 % respectively. <b>The</b> <b>foliages</b> ranked similarly for each of the different methods used to estimate tannin content and activity. Acacia and Sesbania foliage was highly degradable (85 - 87 % potential degradability of DM in sacco), compared to Albizia (52 %), indicating a minimal effect of tannins in Acacia and Sesbania. Yet, in vitro, the tannins in the Acacia inhibited microbial activity more than those in Albizia and Sesbania. Following the addition of polyethylene glycol to neutralise the tannins, gas production and microbial growth increased by 59 % and 0. 09 mg RNA equiv. /dg microbial yield respectively in the Acacia, compared to 16 - 17 % and 0. 06 mg RNA equiv. /dg microbial yield in <b>the</b> other <b>foliages.</b> There was a trend for low in vivo apparent digestibility of N in the Acacia (43. 2 %) and Albizia (44. 2 %) compared to the Sesbania (54. 5 %) supplemented groups. This was likely to be due to presence of tannins. Consistent with this was the low N retention (0. 22 and 0. 19 g N/g NI) in sheep supplemented with Acacia and Albizia compared to that for the Sesbania (0. 32). Similarly, a trend for poor microbial N yield was observed in sheep fed these <b>foliages.</b> Across <b>the</b> <b>foliages</b> tested, an increase in tannin content was associated with a reduction in ruminal fermentation, N digestibility and N retention. For overall nutritive value, Sesbania proved to be the superior forage of the three tested...|$|R

5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. <b>The</b> <b>foliage</b> turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages {{more often}} on <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> of the grey gum (Eucalyptus punctata) over other trees, {{though it does}} also show some {{preference}} for narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (Philemon corniculatus) if both species were present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), little friarbird (P. citreogularis), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus), purple-crowned lorikeet (Glossopsitta porphyrocephala), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.|$|E

5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding amongst <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> in {{the canopy}} of trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several inches to several feet of water.

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite {{to continue with the}} next stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E

In contrast, Diá»‡m was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means.
