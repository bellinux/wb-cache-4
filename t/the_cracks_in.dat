5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe close. The Doctor has to stay outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|In {{science as}} in everything, {{small-scale}} synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> {{the cycle of}} scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually {{at the hands of}} narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that the Doctor has been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence from one of <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{building}} of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War, and an Act of Parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the bedrock. The core of the dam was made of puddled clay mixed with sand. This {{was the first time the}} gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.|$|E

25|$|For {{several centuries}} thereafter, {{the idea of}} chance {{continued}} to be intertwined with fate. Divination was practiced in many cultures, using diverse methods. The Chinese analyzed <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> turtle shells, while the Germans, who according to Tacitus had the highest regards for lots and omens, utilized strips of bark. In the Roman Empire, chance was personified by the Goddess Fortuna. The Romans would partake in games of chance to simulate what Fortuna would have decided.

500|$|The Doctor's enemies {{begin to}} orbit overhead, and the Doctor buys himself {{additional}} {{time with a}} threatening speech. He urges River to bring the TARDIS to Stonehenge while he, Amy, Rory, and the legionaries prepare. When River tries to use the TARDIS, an outside force takes control of it and pilots it to Amy's house in the present day. After River leaves the TARDIS, the scanner screen cracks in the same shape as <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe and a menacing voice says: [...] "Silence will fall." [...] River discovers landing patterns in Amy's garden and sees that someone has broken into the house. She finds in Amy's room a story book about Pandora's box and a children's book about Roman Britain. River communicates this to the Doctor, warning him that the Pandorica must be a trap, created out of Amy's memories. River identifies her current space-time coordinates—26 June 2010, the date the Doctor identified as {{the onset of the}} time energy explosion that caused <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe ("Flesh and Stone"). The Doctor warns her to leave immediately, but she finds herself again trapped in the TARDIS as the central control console begins to go critical.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} {{the debut of}} Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor and Gillan as his new companion. It also introduced Arthur Darvill as Amy's boyfriend Rory Williams, who would later become a main cast member.

The title also references the nature versus nurture argument, with Manson elaborating to CNN: [...] "In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's not a person who will bend the rules or show <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> his armor.

500|$|Moffat {{wrote the}} two-part {{story as a}} more action-packed sequel to his 2007 episode [...] "Blink", {{inspired}} by {{the relationship between the}} film Alien and its sequel, Aliens. The episode contains vital information concerning the main story arc of <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> time, and contains many instances which are character-motivated. [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] were the first two episodes to be filmed; filming for [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] took place in late July, with location filming in Puzzlewood and Southerndown beach. The episode was watched by 8.495 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mostly positive reviews from critics, though many commented that it did not live up to the quality to the first part and disagreed about the decision to show the Angels moving. Additionally, a scene in which Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor generated some complaints to the BBC.|$|E
500|$|With {{the changes}} to the show, Moffat wanted to reassure the {{audience}} that [...] "nothing has really been lost" [...] {{and it was the}} same show and the same character of the Doctor. The story arc of <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the universe was inspired by a crack in the wall of Moffat's son's bedroom. Moffat wanted to make sure the show appealed to even young children; if they could not follow the plot, there would be [...] "big pictures" [...] to entertain them. Moffat believed that Doctor Who was fundamentally for children but it was something everybody loved, comparing it to Star Wars and Toy Story. He considered the [...] "most popular form of entertainment" [...] to be a children's story. Of the series, he said they [...] "pushed the fairytale side of it" [...] as Doctor Who [...] "now has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows" [...] to be more vibrant and [...] "bonkers" [...] than any other fantastical show.|$|E

USA Today likened the track to Gaga's past work and said, [...] "While not perfect, it's buoyant and fun enough, we suppose. Just not groundbreaking." [...] Pitchforks Jillian Mapes felt that [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] did {{not live up to}} its significant anticipation, criticizing the song's production and Gaga's vocal performance. While ranking Lady Gaga's lead singles from worst to best, Billboard listed [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] as second-worst, ahead of only [...] "Applause" [...] (2013).

Guido sacrifices himself for the others by blowing up several kegs of gunpowder that kill him and the girls. Signora Calvierri activates a device on a tower that begins to create the earthquakes and floods that will sink Venice. While Amy and Rory face and defeat Francesco, the Doctor climbs the tower and stops the device in time. The last of her kind, Signora Calvierri throws herself into the canal to be eaten, but not before tormenting the Doctor by reminding him that he is now responsible for the extinction of two species: her own, and the Time Lords.|$|E
500|$|The shallow {{coffering}} in {{the dome}} {{accounts for a}} less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The aggregate material hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest {{at the base of}} the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the [...] "haunches" [...] of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure, may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. <b>The</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} also {{important}} in the main story arc concerning <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> time and space. The idea of the crack {{was inspired by a}} similar crack in the wall of Moffat's son. As the crack reappears, several facts about it are revealed. In the episode, the Doctor speculates that they are connected to the fact that Amy could not remember the events of several previous episodes, as well as events in history that had occurred in [...] "The Next Doctor". He also discovers that the time explosion that caused the crack is 26 June 2010, which is also the original airdate of the final episode of the series, [...] "The Big Bang". Before the Doctor, River, and Octavian leave Amy and the other clerics, the Doctor briefly returns to console Amy and to ask her to trust him and remember what he told her when she was younger; however, the Doctor in this scene is shown wearing his jacket, which he had lost to the Angels earlier in the episode, as well as a different wristwatch. It is revealed in [...] "The Big Bang" [...] that this was in fact the Doctor from later in his timeline, setting up events in Amy's past to try to help her remember him after he has rebooted the universe. River Song tells the Doctor she will see him again when the Pandorica opens; the Pandorica was previously referred to by Prisoner Zero in [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] and is revealed in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", which also sees the return of River Song.|$|E
