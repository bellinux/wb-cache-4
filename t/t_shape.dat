25|$|By the 1820s {{the first}} shaped rolled rails {{had begun to}} be {{produced}} initially of a <b>T</b> <b>shape</b> which required a chair to hold them; the rails were held in position by iron wedges (which sometimes caused the rail to break when forced in) and later by wooden wedges, which became the standard. In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted I beam), which had a flat bottom and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted U section with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|E
2500|$|At {{times the}} gibbet {{was only one}} {{vertical}} stake, called in Latin crux simplex. This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned. Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give {{the shape of a}} T (crux commissa) or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (crux immissa). Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a crux simplex, and that the crux immissa was an invention of Emperor Constantine. [...] Other forms were {{in the shape of the}} letters X and Y. Apparently the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).

2500|$|The [...] "Parting of the Veil", [...] "Piercing of the Veil", [...] "Rending of the Veil" [...] or [...] "Lifting of the Veil" [...] refers, in the Western mystery {{tradition}} and contemporary witchcraft, to opening the [...] "veil" [...] of matter, thus gaining entry {{to a state}} of spiritual awareness in which the mysteries of nature are revealed. In ceremonial magic, the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either palm to palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a <b>T</b> <b>shape.</b> After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.|$|E
2500|$|The old {{electronic}} scoreboard {{was one of}} {{the first}} electric scoreboards in an English football ground, installed in 1991 in time for the 1991–92 season. For the majority of the match, this showed the score and time, but as of the 2011–12 season, the board showed advertisements every few minutes. Before and after the match, information like team line-ups, fixtures, and other results were shown. The scoreboard had become somewhat of a cult icon of Hillsborough Stadium and Sheffield Wednesday as a whole, loved by the fans for its retro looks and [...] "T-fault", where a series of lights making a <b>T</b> <b>shape</b> light up between animations due to a wiring fault, which had not been fixed on purpose by the club both as a joke and also because of its love by the fans. One of the most popular [...] "T-fault" [...] situations was when announcing the score of fierce rivals Sheffield United - the scoreboard displayed [...] "Shhhhhhhh...", then, after a brief pause, [...] "T", and only then did it announce the score.|$|E

D. maghribensis differs from D. phosphaticus by several synapomorphies, most notably: a smooth dorsal margin of the parietal and widely opened choanae, interfenestral bar wide and strongly <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> instead of moderately <b>T</b> <b>shaped.</b>|$|R

40|$|El presente artículo esboza dos aproximaciones sobre la ecuación de diseño a momento flexionante de secciones T en concreto reforzado que se comportan como secciones rectangulares y que trabajan como viguetería de losas aligeradas. La primera aproximación discute la viabilidad de usar el ancho del nervio de la vigueta en lugar de usar el ancho efectivo de la aleta, dentro del proceso de la obtención del acero, requerida para asumir un momento flexionante; la segunda aproximación discute la viabilidad de aproximar la ecuación cuadrática que rige la obtención del área del acero requerida para obtener un momento flexionante en una ecuación lineal, cuyas únicas {{variables}} son el área del acero y la altura efectiva de la sección T. Se ha dimensionado geométricamente un conjunto de secciones de losas aligeradas siguiendo los requisitos del título C 13 de la norma sismo resistente colombiana NSR 98, los cuales se obtuvieron para un modelo simplemente apoyado, cuya luz varía entre [2 - 7] m y el ancho del casetón ente [0. 30 - 1] m. El dimensionamiento antes mencionado fue utilizado para sensibilizar la efectividad de cada una de las aproximaciones propuestas respecto a la solución general para la obtención del área del acero de la sección T que se comporta como rectangular. This {{article presents}} two approaches on the moment design equation of <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> beams. Particularly the beam's T cross section analyzed behaves like a rectangular cross section when the beam {{works like a}} component of a slab system built from a set of <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> beams. The first approach discusses the feasibility to use the web width instead of effective flange width to obtain the steel area associated to the moment solicitation of <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> beam. The second approach discusses the feasibility to approach the quadratic equation used to obtain the steel required to take the bending moment into linear equation related to variables such as steel area and the effective depth of the <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> cross section. It has designed geometrically a set of slabs (built from <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> beams) according to the regulations presented in the chapter C 13 of the Seismic Constructions Colombian Code. The other hand the reinforcement associated to the slabs was obtained for single supported <b>T</b> <b>shaped</b> beams with spans in the range [2 - 7] m and separations between them in the range [0. 30 - 1. 00] m.
