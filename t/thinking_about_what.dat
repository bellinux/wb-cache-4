5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> might have happened to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born {{at the end of}} Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E

50|$|In Fourteen Rings, a box {{sculpture}} in the MacKenzie Art Gallery collection, Urquhart presents an opening-box with an intriguing title. What are the 14 rings? Where are they, {{and what do}} they mean? What happens if you touch them? With this exhibit, Urquhart reminds the viewer that exploring interior mysteries can be more rewarding than admiring familiar and predictable exteriors. By <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what’s</b> inside the box he is encouraging viewers to think outside the box.|$|R
5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it really is to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot {{over the course of a}} year while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{realization}} on {{the basis}} of transmission is possible but rare. Normally an intermediate step is needed in the form of analytic meditation, i.e., <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> one has heard. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions.|$|E
25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

5000|$|Reiner is {{the author}} of several books, {{including}} his 2004 memoir My Anecdotal Life: A Memoir and novels, such as his 2006 novel NNNNN: A Novel. In American Film, he expressed his philosophy on writing comedy: [...] "You have to imagine yourself as not somebody very special but somebody very ordinary. If you imagine yourself as somebody really normal and if it makes you laugh, it's going to make everybody laugh. If you think of yourself as something very special, you'll end up a pedant and a bore. If you start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what's</b> funny, you won't be funny, actually. It's like walking. How do you walk? If you start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it, you'll trip." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{certainly}} don't {{feel like}} a winner. That's how I'd feel {{if there were a}} few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, shaking their heads, <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a happening, a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{else is going on}} in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year, a leaked U.S. {{diplomatic}} cable revealed Argentine concerns related to Brazilian nuclear ambitions. It {{stated that the}} Argentine foreign ministry was <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Argentina’s reaction should be in case Brazil backed out of ABACC or developed a nuclear weapon. According to the document, one of the responses under consideration by Buenos Aires could be the development and deployment of advanced peaceful nuclear technology—such as a nuclear-powered icebreaker—to demonstrate capacity. ABACC did not comment, but one of its Brazilian officials stated that the information expressed in the leaked cable was contrary to the Brazilian–Argentine experience, which was enshrined in mutual trust.|$|E

It should be charismatic to visit, interesting to think about, and famous enough to become iconic in the public discourse. Ideally, it would do for <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> time <b>what</b> the photographs of Earth from space have done for <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the environment. Such icons reframe the way people think." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of time-sharing systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where we expect to find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks {{the most important part of}} the experience of gameplay and the fact that we can often enjoy a game without ever <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century Alfred Stieglitz was the single most {{important}} figure in American photography. He had been working for many years to raise the status of photography as a fine art by writing numerous articles, creating exhibitions, exhibiting his own work and, especially by trying to influence the artistic direction of the highly important Camera Club of New York. He was not successful in the latter, and as a result by the spring of 1902 he was both frustrated and exhausted. He had spent the past five years as editor of the Camera Club's journal Camera Notes, where his efforts to promote photography as a fine art form were regularly challenged by the older, more conservative members of the Club who thought photography {{was nothing more than a}} technical process. Rather than continue to battle against these challenges, he resigned as editor of Camera Notes and spent the summer at his home in Lake George, New York, <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he could do next.|$|E
50|$|Following {{successful}} campaign launches in {{five major}} European cities, the ‘Buy Responsibly’ campaign will be {{launched in the}} UK on 18 October 2011.

The bill specified that an anti-slavery day be held every year to raise awareness of modern day slavery and human trafficking. International Organization for Migration (IOM) and NGOs working on human trafficking issues will be in London’s Trafalgar Square with the giant, upside-down shopping trolley, imprisoning people who represent trafficked migrants workers. The launch event aims to urge UK consumers to play a greater role in ending human trafficking by <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what’s</b> behind the things they buy.|$|R

40|$|I {{want to talk}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{ought to}} be the central {{question}} in election reform, but isn’t: how to get change passed in this country. That’s a tendentious claim given that lots of people devote lots of time to making our election system better. The problem is that they are fighting this battle on hostile terrain, and almost no one is <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to change the terrain itself. We have spent too much time identifying the journey’s end and not enough time figuring out how to smooth the road that leads there. We have a “here to there” problem in election reform. We {{spend a great deal of}} time <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what’s</b> wrong with our election system (the “here”) and how to fix it (the “there”). But we spend almost no time <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to get from here to there [...] how to create an environment in which reform can actually take root. Reform advocates, of course, work tirelessly to help specific projects blossom. But they lack the time and resources to think about the “here to there” problem writ large. Rather than continuing to fight the same fight in the vague hope that something will eventually take, we should take a step back and figure out how to create an environment that is more receptive to change generally. It is time to think less about the end game and more about the interim strategies and institutional tweaks that will help us get from here to there...|$|R
500|$|Docter created Dug {{as he felt}} {{it would}} be {{refreshing}} to show what a dog thinks, rather than what people assume it thinks. Knowledge of canine communication, body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar, veterinarian, dog behaviorist and trainer. The idea for Alpha's voice derived from <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> would happen if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch.

He used Romeo and Juliet as motifs to describe a couple believing they would meet again in the afterlife. He guessed that [...] "40,000 men and women" [...] died each day, and the figure was used {{several times in the}} lyrics.|$|E
