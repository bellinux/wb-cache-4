5|$|Although the MDRM {{leadership}} consistently {{maintained its}} innocence, {{the party was}} dissolved by the French administration on 10 May 1947, and all other political parties, including PADESM, were temporarily suspended. <b>The</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> MDRM further strengthened PADESM's prominence {{after the end of}} the uprising. Between 1951 and 1956, PADESM candidates won three consecutive legislative elections.|$|E
5|$|In June 1966, the now-purged {{parliament}} passed 24 resolutions including <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> Marxism-Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and stripping Sukarno of {{his title}} of President for Life. Against {{the wishes of}} Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining {{support for the president}} amongst elements of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with management changes and route branding, the route network has undergone considerable {{change with the}} removal of several apparently confusing aspects such as letter suffixed routes and clockwise/anticlockwise circular services. Some services have been transferred to and re-routed via Princes Street from the parallel George Street in New Town, after <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> cars from most of Princes Street and the closing of certain access points.|$|E
50|$|The CRLA {{has been}} {{involved}} in litigation that led to <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> DDT, brought legal challenges to the practice of placing non-English-speaking students in special education classes, and <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cortito, the short-handled hoe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Great <b>Ban</b> <b>of</b> Craiova was <b>the</b> Viceroy of Lesser Wallachia and he was, as hierarchic order, the {{greatest}} Wallachian high official. His authority {{was extended to}} the area of Oltenia. Having the consent of the Wallachian ruler, <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> Craiova could confiscate the fortune of the one who made oneself guilty <b>of</b> [...] "betrayal". <b>The</b> <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> Craiova could punish by death the guilty persons.|$|R
50|$|Some drew {{parallels}} between <b>the</b> burkini <b>ban</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>ban</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catholic soutane some 111 years earlier after the 1905 French {{law on the}} Separation of the Churches and the State.|$|R
5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} weapons nor chemical weapons, {{nor did they}} see it as in their interest to acquire them. Thus <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> such weapons was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological Weapons Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|Using the Supersemar letter, Suharto ordered <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> PKI the {{following}} day, {{and proceeded to}} purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the MPRS (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each services.|$|E
5|$|When Adud al-Dawla became emir of Iraq, {{the capital}} city, Baghdad, was {{suffering}} from violence and instability owing to sectarian conflict. In order to bring peace and stability to the city, he ordered <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> public demonstrations and polemics. At the same time, he patronized a number of Shia scholars such as al-Mufid, and sponsored the renovation {{of a number of}} important Shia shrines.|$|E

5|$|Amid PCC/ZAPU's {{calls for}} various strikes and protests, {{including}} an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa {{in the remote}} south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was always}} in favour of Catalan culture but was {{reluctant}} to become politically active to campaign for its autonomy. Politicians, such as Francesc Cambó and Enric Prat de la Riba, suggested that he run for deputy but he refused. In 1920 he was beaten by police in a riot during the Floral Games celebrations. On 11 September 1924, National Day of Catalonia, he was beaten at a demonstration against <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> the Catalan language by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Gaudí was arrested by the Civil Guard, resulting in a short stay in prison, from which he was freed after paying 50 pesetas bail.|$|E
5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power {{to go to}} their heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical music at the dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis on the list of America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E

He was {{a key figure in}} <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA following racist remarks Sterling made in 2014. In one interview, Paul mentioned a possible boycott if Sterling continued to own the team. Paul {{played a significant role in}} the election of Michele Roberts as the Executive Director of the Players Association, giving a strong recommendation to the executive committee responsible for filling the position.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{flags and}} other symbols were confiscated. The {{war on the}} Polish {{language}} included the tearing down of signs in Polish and <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> Polish speech in public places. Persons who spoke Polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted. The Germanization of place names prevailed. Many treasures of Polish culture – including memorials, plaques and monuments to national heroes (e.g., Kraków's Adam Mickiewicz monument) – were destroyed. In Toruń, all Polish monuments and plaques were torn down. Dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout Poland. The Nazis planned to level entire cities.|$|E
5|$|Sienkiewicz {{used his}} growing {{international}} fame to influence world opinion {{in favor of}} the Polish cause (throughout his life and since the late 18th century, Poland remained partitioned by her neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia, later Germany). He often criticized German policies of Germanization of the Polish minority in Germany; in 1901 he expressed support of Września schoolchildren who were protesting <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> the Polish language. More cautiously, he called on Russia's government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland, he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>bans</b> <b>of</b> circuses and operas were reversed, but {{the current}} leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow <b>banned</b> <b>the</b> {{importation}} <b>of</b> cars and trucks produced before 2000.|$|R

5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, {{the celebration of the}} birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> their paper, the Golos Truda group {{continued}} on, however, {{and issued}} a final edition {{in the form of}} a journal, in Petrograd and Moscow in December 1919. During the New Economic Policy period (1921–1928), it released a number of works, including the publication of the collected works of pre-eminent anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin from its bookstore and publishing house in Petrograd between 1919 and 1922. What little anarchist activity the regime tolerated ended in 1929, after the accession of Joseph Stalin, and the bookshops of the Golos Truda group in Moscow and Petrograd were closed permanently amidst an abrupt and violent wave of repression. The newspaper was also suppressed by the Post Office Department in the United States, where it was succeeded by the widely circulated Khleb i Volya (Bread and Freedom), first published on February 26, 1919, which in turn was banned from the United States and Canada for its anarchist position.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, but with <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive {{and won the}} first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E

5|$|Paine left England {{before he}} could be tried, {{as he had been}} elected a member of the National Convention in France, tasked with writing a new constitution. He {{departed}} England on 13 September, never to return, although he further infuriated the government remotely by republishing the Rights of Man and writing Letter Addressed to the Addressors of the Late Proclamation, in which he defended his actions and beliefs against those who had chosen to side with the government. Paine was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a famous lawyer and orator who served as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. As the trial date approached, both Erskine and Paine were targeted by vicious personal attacks. Paine's writ was followed by hundreds of loyal addresses, many of which targeted him, the burning of an effigy in Exeter, and <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> the sale of any of his books in Chester. Pamphlets slandering him were widely published, and both Paine and Erskine had their personal lives dug into.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{formally}} disestablished the Macedonian monarchy {{by installing}} four separate allied republics in its stead, their capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia. The Romans imposed severe laws inhibiting many {{social and economic}} interactions between the inhabitants of these respective republics, including <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> marriages {{between them and the}} (temporary) prohibition on the use of Macedonia's gold and silver mines. However, a certain Andriscus claiming Antigonid descent rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Iuventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148 BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom. This was followed in 146 BC by the Roman destruction of Carthage and victory over the Achaean League at the Battle of Corinth, ushering in the era of Roman Greece and the gradual establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and <b>the</b> <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
