5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E

They built some 60 new villages and dispersed settlements, populated by 27,500 people in 1945, according to the Mandate authorities. The only exception were the Negev Bedouin who remained semi-nomadic, but it was clear <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later they will be settled, too.|$|E

During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying {{too much on the}} Americans, saying <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later they would always do what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, <b>that,</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both the}} season four episode [...] "Paper Hearts" [...] and the season five episode [...] "Redux II" [...] {{had dealt with}} {{possible}} explanations for Samantha Mulder's fate, the issue {{had yet to be}} resolved when the series moved into its seventh season. Realizing that the season potentially could be the last, series creator Chris Carter decided to conclude the Samantha story-arc. [...] "The expectation was that if this were going to be the final season, that the finale would be about Mulder's sister. We wanted to deal with <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> rather than later. We wanted to wrap up Mulder's emotion story with his sister and do {{it in such a way}} that would emphasize [...] dramatic abilities." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{interpret}} the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. [...] Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship {{in such a}} manner that Jake knew [...] "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later he would have to pay the bill." [...] Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to San Sebastián, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, [...] "you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her." [...] By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the [...] "everyman," [...] and that {{in the course of the}} narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a morality play with Jake as the person who loses the most.|$|E
500|$|Bond {{joined the}} Bomb Squad, newly formed in January 1971 due to concern over The Angry Brigade. Bond became the unit's first {{commander}} on 23 June 1971, being promoted to that position in 1969. The unit served at Tintagel House, and Bond's name was theoretically {{meant to be}} kept secret {{and he should be}} called 'Commander X', so that he was not bombed, but journalists have since claimed to have known his name within days of his appointment. The press lauded Commander X as a [...] "mystery supremo to hunt down the Angry Brigade." [...] The Angry Brigade was a new political group; [...] "a small group [...] of leftwing radicals and anarchists," [...] who claimed responsibility for about 20 small bombings which began on 20 November 1970, with the bombing of a BBC van. At its formation, the Bomb Squad comprised around 30 men, one third from CID, the rest from Special Branch. The Angry Brigade's decline came in 1971, when various conspirators were arrested. At the 1971–72 trial, the nine conspirators were denied bail at Clerkenwell Court after Bond opposed the move, and the judge, J Purcell, [...] "remanded all nine in custody for a week." [...] There were concerns that the police had [...] "over-reached themselves." [...] The Angry Brigade member John Barker later said that [...] "the police framed a guilty man," [...] and Bond was called an [...] "old-fashioned plod" [...] by a defendant. He told the Purcell that [...] "I am quite certain <b>that,</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, we would have had somebody killed." [...] Due to his success, in 1972 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Operations).|$|E

2500|$|The {{murder of}} Torregiani and Sabbadin had been {{decided by the}} PAC because {{both of them had}} killed a robber-terrorist in the past, thus as an act of armed {{opposition}} to self-defense by attacked persons. Torregiani was killed as revenge in front of his 13-year-old son, who was also shot by his father {{as a result of a}} tragic error. The paraplegic Torregiani considers now that, in any case, Battisti is responsible for the shooting, and should serve his sentence in jail: [...] "It's not about the person of Cesare Battisti - he declared to the national press agency ANSA - It's in order that everyone understands <b>that,</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, those who have committed such serious crimes should pay for their faults".|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, her {{writings}} on arson attacks in Frankfurt as {{protests against the}} Vietnam War resulted in her developing an acquaintance with the perpetrators, most significantly Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. She stopped writing for konkret which had in her opinion evolved into a completely commercial magazine {{in the early part}} of 1969, and many other authors followed her. She stated that neither she nor her collaborators wanted to give a left-wing alibi to the magazine, <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later [...] "would become part of the counter-revolution, a thing that I cannot gloss over with my co-operation, especially now that it is impossible to deter its course". Later, they organised an occupation at konkrets office (along with several members of the [...] ), to distribute proclamations to the employees, something that failed since Röhl learned about it, and moved the employees to their homes to continue their work from there. Finally, Röhl's house was vandalised by some of the protesters. Meinhof arrived in Röhl's villa at 11:30, after police and journalists had already arrived. She was accused by Röhl (and subsequently described by the media) as the organizer of the vandalism. It was difficult to prove, as she was not there when it happened.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, Lindsey {{is finally}} exposed as the Gloved Hand Killer. When Lindsey tries {{to hide from}} the police, Silas {{contacts}} her and helps her escape. She recognises him from the hospital, and he reveals his true identity to her. Silas tells her that he wants to help her as he, [...] "knew a Lynsey once before", and it is a beautiful name. He expresses a deep admiration for her work so far and offers her the chance to go into hiding with him as he feels that with the right tuition from him, the pair would make an unstoppable force. As Lindsey gives him a willing smile, the two serial killers drive off into the night. Lindsey later calls Silas in desperate need of his help after she attempts to convince Kim to steal her son, JJ from her ex-fiancé, Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan). Silas replies by saying that he knew she would return to him, and hangs up the phone with a sinister smile. Silas turns his attention to Kim, using a fake name [...] "Edward" [...] on social media, to lure her in. Believing that he has information on Lindsey's whereabouts, Kim inadvertently goes along with it. Silas tells her he is a retired policeman and uses her as a decoy so that the two killers can go ahead with their dastardly plans. Silas later meets Lindsey at a car park and tells her that he has Kim on side and that the plan is proceeding perfectly: <b>that</b> <b>sooner</b> or later, Lindsey will be reunited with her son and he will finally get another chance to claim the life of Mercedes.|$|E
