5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E
5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, {{and there are no}} infinitesimals.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} to have evolved from mainland-based ancestors, and may share ancestors with C. melanosterna and C. palearis, as it is phylogenetically closer to these two <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> C. similis.

5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is {{more closely related to}} certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> other rorquals such as the minke whales.|$|E
5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs {{in reaction to}} the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E
50|$|Butcher and Bolt {{was widely}} seen as {{providing}} insight into why the Afghan war proved a far harder fight <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had initially looked in 2001.

2500|$|Years later, teacher Hans Meyer said, [...] "At the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> less {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a good teacher}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an sympathetic human being. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> more important <b>to</b> give them a good-night kiss than [...] excellent German literature." [...] In some cases, there would be letters from parents and then they'd stop coming, particularly once war broke out. Meyer said, [...] "We tried to lead {{them away from the}} period of silence.

5|$|The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) {{known as}} T Li 41, is tiny, with {{a length of}} 1.29mm and width of 1.82mm. Mein and Ginsburg claim {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} known prosimian molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps—the protocone, paracone, and metacone—are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located {{at the back of the}} tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} {{was first}} named by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797 as Elephas africanus. The genus Loxodonta was named by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825. Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte, but in 1827 an anonymous author romanised the spelling to Loxodonta; the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises {{this as the}} proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but further morphological data has {{reduced the number of}} classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (L.a.africana) and the forest elephant (L.a.cyclotis), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist Paul Matschie. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (L.africana and L.cyclotis respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that L. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct Palaeoloxodon antiquus, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> L. africana, possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed. The pygmy elephants of the Congo Basin, which have been suggested to be a separate species (Loxodonta pumilio) are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, metal-hulled steamships had {{replaced}} wooden ships as a means of transporting goods. Railroads had also come into their own as a means of shipping.

25|$|Palmerston's {{speech was}} so {{successful}} that Spencer Perceval, who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, then a less important office <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> become from the mid nineteenth century.

25|$|Obtaining the {{molecular}} clone {{of a gene}} {{can lead to the}} development of organisms that produce the protein product of the cloned genes, termed a recombinant protein. In practice, it is frequently more difficult to develop an organism that produces an active form of the recombinant protein in desirable quantities <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> clone the gene. This is because {{the molecular}} signals for gene expression are complex and variable, and because protein folding, stability and transport can be very challenging.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{acceptance}} may {{be limited}} due to the potentially offensive banana-like smell of n-butanol. Plans are underway to market a fuel that is 85% Ethanol and 15% Butanol (E85B), so existing E85 internal combustion engines can run on a 100% renewable fuel {{that could be made}} without using any fossil fuels.

25|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{powered by}} batteries are another alternative, and these {{have the advantage}} of having the highest well-to-wheels efficiency rate of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper to sequester carbon from a few thousand smokestacks <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> retrofit hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to other genome editing techniques TALEN {{falls in the}} middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike ZFNs, TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets. On the other hand, CRISPR relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome {{and they can be}} cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.|$|E
25|$|Overexposure to {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{is known to}} cause skin cancer, make skin age and wrinkle faster, mutate DNA, and impair the immune system.
