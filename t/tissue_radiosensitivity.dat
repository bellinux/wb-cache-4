IIB and higher) and therapy is more difficult than in lower stage tumors.

40|$|Because meningiomas tend to recur after (partial) {{surgical}} resection, radiotherapy {{is increasingly}} being {{applied for the}} treatment of these tumors. Radiation dose levels are limited, however, to avoid radiation damage to the surrounding normal <b>tissue.</b> The <b>radiosensitivity</b> of tumors can be improved by increasing tumor oxygen levels. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if breathing a hyperoxic hypercapnic gas mixture could improve the oxygenation of meningiomas. Blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic Gadolinium (Gd) -DTPA contrast-enhanced MRI were used to assess changes in tumor blood oxygenation and vascularity, respectively. Ten meningioma patients were each studied twice; without and with breathing a gas mixture consisting of 2 % CO(2) and 98 % O(2). Values of T(2) * and the Gd-DTPA uptake rate k(ep) were calculated under both conditions. In six tumors a significant increase in the value of T(2) * in the tumor was found, suggesting an improved tumor blood oxygenation, which exceeded the effect in normal brain tissue. Contrarily, two tumors showed a significant T(2) * decrease. The change in T(2) * was found to correlate with both k(ep) and with the change in k(ep). The presence of both vascular effects and oxygenation effects and the heterogeneous response to hypercapnic hyperoxia necessitates individual assessment of the effects of breathing a hyperoxic hypercapnic gas mixture on meningiomas.

A relatively simple and suitable method for routine clinical practice is needed for preliminary assessment of normal <b>tissue</b> intrinsic <b>radiosensitivity.</b> The micronucleus test (MNT) determines {{the frequency of the}} radiation induced micronuclei (MN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes, which could serve as an indicator of intrinsic cell radiosensitivity. AimTo investigate a possible use of the micronucleus test (MNT) for acute radiation morbidity prediction in gynecological cancer patients. Materials and methodsForty gynecological cancer patients received 50 Gy conventional external pelvic irradiation after radical surgery. A four-field “box” technique was applied with 2 D planning. The control group included 10 healthy females. Acute normal tissue reactions were graded according to NCI CTCAE v. 3. 0. From all reaction scores, the highest score named “summarized clinical radiosensitivity” was selected for a statistical analysis. MNT was performed before and after in vitro irradiation with 1. 5 Gy. The mean radiation induced frequency of micronuclei per 1000 binucleated cells (MN/ 1000) and lymphocytes containing micronuclei per 1000 binucleated cells (cells with MN/ 1000) were evaluated for both patients and controls. An arbitrary cut off value was created to pick up a radiosensitive individual: the mean value of spontaneous frequency of cells with MN/ 1000 ± 2 SD, found in the control group. ResultsBoth mean spontaneous frequency of cells with MN/ 1000 and MN/ 1000 were registered to be significantly higher in cancer patients compared to the control group (t= 2. 46, p= 0. 02 and t= 2. 51, p= 0. 02). No statistical difference was registered when comparing radiation induced MN frequencies between those groups. Eighty percent (32) of patients developed grade 2 summarized clinical radiosensitivity, with great variations in MNT parameters. Only three patients with grade 2 “summarized clinical radiosensitivity” had values of cells with MN/ 1000 above the chosen radiosensitivity threshold.

30|$|To date, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} evidence that unrepaired DSB are responsible for cell lethality and <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> and that misrepaired DSB are linked to genomic instability and cancer proneness [15]. In the low-dose exposure of CT exams, tissue over-reactions are not expected and anaphylactic reactions observed in some patients shortly after ICM injections are not necessarily linked to unrepaired DSB [16]. Conversely, misrepaired DSB contributing to an increased cancer risk represent one major outcome of the ICM effect, {{even if there is}} still no consensus about specific misrepaired DSB markers. In addition, at the doses applied during CT exams, some specific effects, such as the low-dose hypersensitivity phenomenon, may lead to both excess of cell death and mutations [17, 18]. Thus, the contrast enhancement obtained by ICM may also strongly depend on individual radiosensitivity, which could explain the discrepancy between different authors about its quantitative contribution to the total dose (Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|E

The accurate diagnosis and treatment of intestinal radiation injury often represents a clinical challenge to practicing physicians in both gastroenterology and oncology.

40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} (IR) is {{an effective}} anticancer treatment, although failures still occur. To improve radiotherapy, tumor-targeted strategies are needed to increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells, without influencing normal <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) contribute to the determination of sensitivity to IR. A crucial protein in BER/SSBR is DNA polymerase beta (polbeta). Aberrant polbeta expression is commonly found in human tumors and leads to inhibition of BER. Here, we show that truncated polbeta variant (polbeta-Delta) -expressing cells depend on homologous recombination (HR) for survival after IR, indicating that a considerable fraction of polbeta-Delta-induced lesions are subject to repair by HR. Increased sensitization was found not to result from involvement in DNA-dependent protein kinase-dependent nonhomologous end joining, the other major double-strand break repair pathway. Caffeine and the ATM inhibitor Ku 55933 cause polbeta-Delta-dependent radiosensitization. Consistent with the observed HR dependence and the known HR-modulating activity of ATM, polbeta-Delta-expressing cells showed increased radiosensitization after BRCA 2 knockdown that is absent under ATM-inhibited conditions. Our data suggest that treatment with HR modulators is a promising therapeutic strategy for exploiting defects in the BER/SSBR pathway in human tumors...|$|E
40|$|Planning of {{combined}} radiotherapy and hyperthermia treatments {{should be}} performed taking the synergistic action between the two modalities into account. This work evaluates the available experimental data on cytotoxicity of combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia treatment and the requirements for integration of hyperthermia and radiotherapy treatment planning into a single planning platform. The underlying synergistic mechanisms of hyperthermia include inhibiting DNA repair, selective killing of radioresistant hypoxic tumour <b>tissue</b> and increased <b>radiosensitivity</b> by enhanced <b>tissue</b> perfusion. Each of these mechanisms displays different dose-effect relations, different optimal time intervals and different optimal sequences between radiotherapy and hyperthermia. Radiosensitisation can be modelled using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model to account for DNA repair inhibition by hyperthermia. In a recent study, an LQ model-based thermoradiotherapy planning (TRTP) system was used to demonstrate that dose escalation by hyperthermia is equivalent to ∼ 10 Gy for prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. The first step for more reliable TRTP is further expansion of the data set of LQ parameters for normally oxygenated normal and tumour tissue valid over the temperature range used clinically and for the relevant time intervals between radiotherapy and hyperthermia. The {{next step is to}} model the effect of hyperthermia in hypoxic tumour cells including the physiological response to hyperthermia and the resulting reoxygenation.

40|$|Bioimpedance and {{treatment}} response monitoring in cancer research Bioimpedance monitoring in vivo is an non-invasive technique to examine changes in electrical conductivity. The electrical properties of tissue {{depend upon the}} structural organization of cells, cell shape, structure and orientation, integrity of cell membranes, relative proportions of intra- and extra-cellular fluids and ionic composition within the tissue. Non-invasive bioimpedance monitoring techniques, correlated with pathology, {{may be used to}} predict radiosensitivity of tumours. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the ability of bioimpedance monitoring to describe morphology and physiology of non-treated cancerous <b>tissue</b> and mapping <b>radiosensitivity</b> of tumors with different type, size and pathobiology. A model with xenografts established from the human colorectal cell line HT 29 were grown from implanted tumor tissue into immune-deficient GBNIH nude mice. Laboratory animals of male sex were anaesthetized with katte-zoletilmix and tumor size monitoried continuously. The mice were divided into three dose groups each given 0, 5, and 15 Gy with an 60 Co source, respectively. Impedance measurements were performed with a 4 -electrode probe. Tumor was compressed between the two electrodes to get full contact with surfaces. Impedances were recorded at frequencies between 1 Hz and 1 MHz with a Solartron 1260 gain-phase analyzer and Solartron 1294 impedance unit. Electrical impedance monitoring, as applied in this study, was evaluated as a measurement technique for radiation response prediction. The preclinical study, conducted on nude mice implanted with a human colorectal cancer, revealed the ability of bioimpedance monitoring method to detect radiation-induced electrical changes of growing tumors on an individual subject basis. There are two components of our study, electrical impedance monitoring and histological assessment. Impedance results are presented as a function of time. Impedans and phase data for irradiated and non-irradiated tumour are plotted as a function of necrosis fraction and tumor volume. Impedance and phase values at low frequencies show some response to radiation injury. There was found to be correlation in both cases: between impedance and necrosis fraction and between impedance and tumor volume.

We analysed 22 polymorphisms in 17 genes having functional relevance to radiation response. Radiation therapy induced oral mucositis and skin erythema was considered as end point for clinical radiosensitivity. Direct correlation of heterozygous and mutant alleles with acute reactions as well as haplotype correlation revealed NBN variants to be of predictive significance in analysing oral mucositis prior to radiotherapy. In addition, genetic linkage disequilibrium existed in XRCC 1 polymorphisms for >grade 2 oral mucositis and skin reaction indicating the complex inheritance pattern.

A study was made of nine fibroblast strains established from vaginal biopsies of pretreatment cervical cancer patients and an ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) cell strain. Cells were irradiated in plateau phase, replated and treated with cytochalasin B 24 h later. MN formation was examined 72 h after irradiation as the number of MN in 100 binucleate cells. The method yielded low spontaneous MN yields (< 7 per 100 cells), and mean induced MN frequencies after 3. 5 Gy varied between cell strains from 18 to 144 per 100 cells. However, in repeat experiments, considerable intrastrain variability was observed (CV = 32 %), with up to twofold differences in MN yields, although this was less than interstrain variability (CV = 62 %). An analysis was made of the relationship between MN results and previously obtained clonogenic survival data. There was a significant correlation between MN yields and clonogenic survival. However, when the A-T strain was excluded from the analysis, the correlation lost significance, mainly because of one slow-growing strain which was the most sensitive to cell killing but had almost the lowest MN frequency.

40|$|Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a {{treatment}} modality {{that involves the}} use of radioactively labeled targeting agents to deliver a cytotoxic dose of radiation to tumor while sparing normal tissue. The biologic function of the target and the biologic action of the targeting agent is largely irrelevant as long as the targeting agent delivers cytotoxic radiation to the tumor. Preclinical RPT studies use imaging and ex vivo evaluation of radioactivity concentration in target and normal tissues to obtain biodistribution and pharma-cokinetic data {{that can be used to}} evaluate radiation absorbed doses. Since the efficacy and toxicity of RPT depend on radiation absorbed dose, this quantity can be used to translate results from preclinical studies to human studies. The absorbed dose can also be used to customize therapy to account for pharmacokinetic and other differences among patients so as to deliver a prespecified absorbed dose to the tumor or to dose-limiting tissue.

40|$|Radiation oncologists have {{observed}} variation in normal tissue responses between patients {{in many instances}} with no apparent explanation. The association of clinical <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> with specific genetic repair defects (Wegner’s Syndrome, Ataxia Telangiectasia, Bloom’s Syndrome, and Fanconi Anemia) has been well established, but there are unexplained differences between patients {{in the general population}} with respect to the intensity and rapidity of appearance of normal tissue toxicity including radiation dermatitis, oral cavity mucositis, esophagitis, as well as differences in response of normal tissues to standard analgesic or other palliative measures. Strategies for the use of clinical radioprotectors have included modalities designed to either prevent and/or palliate the consequences of radiosensitivity. Most prominently, modification of total dose, fraction size, or total time of treatment delivery has been necessary in many patients, but such modifications may reduce the likelihood of local control and/or radiocurability. As a model system in which to study potential radioprotection by mitochondrial targeted antioxidant small molecules, we have studied cell lines and tissues from Fanconi Anemia (Fancd 2 -/-) mice of two background strains (C 57 BL/ 6 NHsd, and FVB/N). Both were shown to be radiosensitive with respect to clonogenic survival curves of bone marrow stromal cells in culture and severity of oral cavity mucositis during single fraction or fractionated radiotherapy. Oral administration of the antioxidant GS-nitroxide, JP 4 - 039, provided significant radioprotection, and also ameliorated distant bone marrow suppression (abscopal effect of irradiation) in Fancd 2 -/- mice.

Evidence is accumulating on the role of polymorphic genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence normal tissue response after radiation. The most studied SNPs include those in genes involved in DNA repair (single- and double-strand breaks, and base excision) and those active in the response to oxidative stress. Case report: We present the case report of a 60 -year-old woman with early breast cancer who underwent adjuvant hormone therapy and conventional radiotherapy, and subsequently developed unacceptable cosmetic toxicities of the irradiated breast requiring a genetic test of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. The patient was found to be heterozygous for G 28152 A (T/C) and C 18067 T (A/G) mutations in X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC 1) and 3 (XRCC 3), respectively, homozygous for A 313 G (G/G) mutation in glutathione S transferase Pi 1 (GSTP 1), and wild-type for A 4541 G (A/A) in XRCC 3 and G 135 C (G/G) in RAD 51 recombinase. Conclusion: The role of SNPs should be taken into account when a severe phenomenon appears in normal tissues after radiation treatment, because understanding the molecular basis of individual radiosensitivity may be useful for identifying moderately or extremely radiosensitive patients who may need tailored therapeutic strategies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allogeneic {{bone marrow}} {{transplantation}} (allo-BMT) is a potentially curative therapy {{for a variety of}} hematologic diseases, but benefits, including graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity are limited by graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam 1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam 1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models. METHODS: We studied Ceacam 1 as a regulator of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} (allo-BMT) in mouse models. In vivo, Ceacam 1 (-/-) T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD 25 (hi), CD 62 L(lo)). Additionally, Ceacam 1 (-/-) CD 8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin α(4) β(7), though both CD 4 and CD 8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut post-transplant. Ceacam 1 (-/-) recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam 1 (-/-) mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam 1 -overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam 1 (+) lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam 1 (-/-) vs. control T cells.

In recipients of allo-BMT, Ceacam 1 may also regulate <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Because of its expression on both the donor graft and host tissues, this suggests that targeting Ceacam 1 may represent a potent strategy for the regulation of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic transplantation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the possibility of increasing the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of a tumor-selective radiolabeled antibody when radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is combined with extracorporeal depletion of radioimmunoconjugates from the circulation. Furthermore, the authors evaluated whether this increase in dose improved the therapeutic effect on solid manifest tumors in an immunocompetent animal model. METHODS: Rats were injected with high activities/body weight of lutetium (Lu- 177) - or yttrium (Y- 90) -labeled antibody conjugates (monoclonal antibody tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid-biotin) and subjected to removal of the conjugate from the circulation by extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment 24 hours postinjection. Myelotoxicity was assessed by analysis of blood parameters for 12 weeks. The effect of increased doses in combination with extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment was evaluated with respect to myelotoxicity and therapeutic effect in a syngeneic rat colon cancer model. RESULTS: The MTD of Lu- 177 - or Y- 90 -labeled immunoconjugates could be increased 2. 0 x or 1. 5 x, respectively, when RIT was combined with extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment. All animals treated with Lu- 177 - or Y- 90 -labeled antibodies showed persistent complete response of manifest tumors (approximately 10 x 15 mm) within 16 days postinjection. However, several animals showed disseminated disease 1. 5 to 3 months postinjection. CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment is a method that safely and efficiently reduces myelotoxicity associated with RIT. Extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment allows increased administered activity without increased toxicity, with the aim of increasing the absorbed dose to the tumor. However, because tumor/normal <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> ratios are more favorable in rodents, {{it is not possible to}} draw any conclusions concerning the therapeutic efficacy of increased administered activity in combination with extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment in this study.

As use of biological models in treatment planning expands, uncertainties {{associated with the use}} of specific models for predicting outcomes should be understood and quantified. In particular, the question to what extent model predictions are data-driven or dependent on the choice of the model has to be explored. Methods Four dose-response models [...] logistic, log-logistic, Poisson-based and probit [...] were tested for their ability and consistency in describing dose-response data for radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) and retinopathy (RIRP). Dose to the optic nerves was specified as the minimum dose, D min, received by any segment of the organ to which the damage was diagnosed by ophthalmologic evaluation. For retinopathy, the dose to the retina was specified as the highest isodose covering at least 1 / 3 of the retinal surface (D 33 %) that geometrically covered the observed retinal damage. Data on both complications were modeled separately for patients treated once daily and twice daily. Model parameters D 50 and γ and corresponding confidence intervals were obtained using maximum-likelihood method. Results Model parameters were reasonably consistent for RION data for patients treated once daily, D 50 ranging from 94. 2 to 104. 7 Gy and γ from 0. 88 to 1. 41. Similar consistency was seen for RIRP data which span a broad range of complication incidence, with D 50 from 72. 2 to 75. 0 Gy and γ from 1. 51 to 2. 16 for patients treated twice daily; 72. 2 - 74. 0 Gy and 0. 84 - 1. 20 for patients treated once daily. However, large variations were observed for RION in patients treated twice daily, D 50 from 96. 3 to 125. 2 Gy and γ from 0. 80 to 1. 56. Complication incidence in this dataset in any dose group did not exceed 20 %. Conclusions For the considered data sets, the log-logistic model tends to lead to larger D 50 and lower γ compared to other models for all datasets. Statements regarding normal <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity</b> and steepness of dose-response, based on model parameters, should be made with caution as the latter are not only model-dependent but also sensitive to the range of complication incidence exhibited by clinical data. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a {{need for}} rapid and {{reliable}} tests for the prediction of normal tissue responses to radiotherapy, as this could lead to individualization of patient radiotherapy schedules and thus improvements in the therapeutic ratio. Because the use of cultured fibroblasts is too slow to be practicable in a clinical setting, we evaluated the predictive role of assays of lymphocyte chromosomal radiosensitivity in patients having radiotherapy for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiosensitivity was assessed using a micronucleus (MN) assay at high dose rate (HDR) and low dose rate (LDR) on lymphocytes irradiated in the G(0) phase of the cell cycle (Scott D, Barber JB, Levine EL, Burril W, Roberts SA. Radiation-induced micronucleus induction in lymphocytes identifies a frequency of radiosensitive cases among breast cancer patients: a test for predispostion? Br. J. Cancer 1998; 77; 614 - 620) and an assay of G(2) phase chromatid radiosensitivity ('G(2) assay') (Scott D, Spreadborough A, Levine E, Roberts SA. Genetic predisposition in breast cancer. Lancet 1994; 344 : 1444). In a study of acute reactions, blood samples were taken from breast cancer patients before the start of radiotherapy, and the skin reaction documented. 116 patients were tested with the HDR MN assay, 73 with the LDR MN assay and 123 with the G(2) assay. In a study of late reactions, samples were taken from a series of breast cancer patients 8 - 14 years after radiotherapy and the patients assessed for the severity of late effects according to the'LENT SOMA' scales. 47 were tested with the HDR assay, 26 with the LDR assay and 19 with the G(2) assay. For each clinical endpoint, patients were classified as being normal reactors or 'highly radiosensitive patients' (HR patients (Burnet NG. Johansen J, Turesson I, Nyman J. Describing patients' normal tissue reactions: Concerning the possiblity of individualising radiotherapy dose presciptions based on potential predictive assays of normal <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Int. J. Cancer 1998; 79 : 606 - 613)). RESULTS: The HR patients could be identified in some of the assays. For example, for acute skin reactions, 9 / 123 patients were judged as HR; they had significantly higher G(2) scores than normal reactors (P= 0. 004). For the late reactions, the mean HDR MN scores were higher for the 4 / 47 patients who had severe telangiectasia (P= 0. 042) and the 8 / 47 patients had severe fibrosis (P= 0. 055). However, there were no trends towards increased chromosomal radiosensitivity with the micronucleus scores at HDR or LDR, or with G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: While these results support the concept of using lymphocytes to detect elevated sensitivity to radiotherapy (as an alternative to fibroblasts), these assays are unlikely to be of assistance for the prediction of normal tissue effects in the clinic in their present form...|$|E
40|$|Ionizing {{procedures}} provide essential life-saving information, but {{great care}} must be taken regarding their possible long-term health consequences. The biological and clinical burdens of medical radiation represents a worrisome social and medical problem. DNA damage is the main initiating event by which radiation may results in cancer development. Thus considerable efforts should be made to mitigate radiation-induced cell damage. Because radiation induced cellular damage is attributed primarily to the harmful effects of free radicals, the efficacy of non-toxic radioprotectors with radical scavenging properties should be investigated in the clinical setting. These agents may inhibit or reduce free radical toxicity, thus offering protection against radiation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is considered a promising radio-protector for its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties and could be able to inhibit or reduce free radical toxicity, thus offering protection against radiation. Moreover, recent evidences have recognized that genetic factors influence the risk of radiation-induced effects and the Seventh National Academy of Science report on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) included the identification of genes conferring predisposition to radiation-induced health effects as a top research need. Genetic polymorphisms in the detoxification and DNA repair genes are specifically proposed as candidates for genetic predisposition to radiation-induced biological damage. The identification and characterization of genes that enhance prediction of disease risk and improve prevention, treatment, and quality of care remain important goals in the modern imaging practice. Specifically, it is anticipated that the use of genetic markers may {{serve as the basis for}} personalized radiotherapy in which cancer management is formulated so that it optimizes the treatment plan for each patient based on their genetic background (radiogenomics). In order to improve this knowledge, the primary aims of the project were: - Aim 1 : to evaluate the ability of NAC in conferring protection against radiation induced chromosomal DNA damage. - Aim 2 : to assess the value of functional polymorphisms of genes involved in DNA damage repair and oxidative stress response as predictive factors for the occurrence of acute skin reactions. To reach aim 1, 65 patients undergoing invasive cardiovascular procedures received the standard hydration protocol consisting of intravenous isotonic saline for 12 h after catheterization (Group I) while 30 patients received a clinically driven double intravenous dose of NAC for 1 hour before and a standard dose for 12 hours following catheterization (Group II). Micronucleus assay (MN) was performed as biomarker of chromosomal damage and intermediate endpoint in carcinogenesis. MN frequency evaluated before, 2 and 24 hours after the radiation exposure showed a significant increase of 24. 1 % at 2 hours and of 21. 4 % at 24 hours in the Group I (p= 0. 03), while the non-significant increase of MN was 13. 1 % at 2 hours and 8. 7 % at 24 hours in Group II (p= 0. 4). These results suggested that NAC may be an effective promising, well-tolerated antioxidant approach easily usable in the clinical practice to offer protection against DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation exposure during cardiac catheterization procedures. To reach aim 2, skin toxicity was scored according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria in 59 breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy after conserving surgery. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XRCC 3 (Thr 241 Met), XRCC 1 (Arg 399 Gln, and Arg 194 Trp) and in GSTT 1 and GSTM 1 were determined by PCR-RFPL analysis. According to RTOG criteria, grade 1 and 2 acute skin reactivity was observed in 24 (41 %) of the 59 participants. Univariate analysis indicated that XRCC 3 241 Met variant (OR: 2. 5 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 7. 3, p= 0. 05) and GSTM 1 null genotype (OR: 3. 5 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 10. 4 p= 0. 02) as well as BMI (OR: 3. 6 CI: 1. 2 - 11, p= 0. 02) were associated with the risk of acute skin radiosensitivity. The logistic multivariate analysis confirmed that the two genetic variants increased the individual susceptibility to acute skin reaction. Our findings suggest that the presence of SNPs involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress may in part explain the individual response to acute skin toxicity in patients undergoing partial breast irradiation after conserving surgery. The association analysis between clinical characteristics and genotype with the acute radiation skin toxicity in breast cancer patients suggests that approaches based on (multiple) genetic markers and clinical characteristics have the potential to predict normal <b>tissue</b> <b>radiosensitivity.</b> Although our findings are to be carefully assessed with further large, randomized studies, taken together have outmost clinical relevance since add important information to reach a personalized measure of radiation risk in order to implement tailored preventive and chemopreventive strategies...|$|E
