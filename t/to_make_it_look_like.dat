5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, {{as a source for}} lighting.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E

He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger's house <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the killer was one of Dr. Kroger's patients.|$|E

5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, {{five of the six}} 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

Ravanal says he found details in the 1973 autopsy report are not consistent with suicide and that the wounds on the body were likely caused {{by more than one}} gun. The cranium, he says, shows evidence of a first shot with a small gun, like a pistol, and then, a second shot from a larger weapon—like an AK-47—which could mean that Allende was shot and killed, then shot a second time with his own gun, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> suicide.|$|E

While in high school, Riesel began typing stories about the American labor movement and sending them to English language newspapers around the world, charging $1 for publication rights. He typed the same story over and over (sometimes as many as 15 times) <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an original (his goal being to sell the same story to many newspapers rather than many stories to a single newspaper), and earned a significant income from this work.|$|E

Wanderer told the man that his relationship with his wife was deteriorating, and he wanted to stage a fight to prove himself a hero to Ruth. When Watson showed up at the apartment, however, Wanderer shot both him and his wife with the two Colts and staged it so that Ruth's mother would think Watson had killed Ruth.|$|E
25|$|I Confess was {{followed}} by three popular colour films starring Grace Kelly. Dial M for Murder (1954) was adapted from the stage play by Frederick Knott. Ray Milland plays the scheming villain, an ex-tennis pro who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a premeditated murder by his wife. Her lover Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) and Police Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) work urgently to save her from execution. With Dial M, Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography, with the film now being available in the 3D format on Blu-ray.|$|E

The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in {{undetermined}} order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to come in from the caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the message on the computer, arranged the scene <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a suicide, and called 111. The defence submitted that Robin Bain killed the other family members, typed the message and shot himself while David was out on his paper round.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Barnett (c. 1858–1927) was {{a former}} fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and {{separated}} after {{he lost his job}} and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution. Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him. Other acquaintances of Kelly's put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, Brady {{completed}} 7 of 8 passes for 54yards on an 82-yard drive.

The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving Wes Welker open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver Dennis Northcutt dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a Josh Scobee 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–17. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's Derek Landri was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28–17 lead.|$|E
