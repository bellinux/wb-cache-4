However, {{it must be noted that}} this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E

Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Argonauts' {{first home}} was Rosedale Field at Mount Pleasant Road and MacLennan Avenue {{near the city}} centre. The team {{suggests}} its capacity was 10,000 total with 4,000 seated, though O'Leary and Parrish list smaller numbers, noting that a $32,000 renovation in 1883 allowed for a capacity of 2,000. <b>The</b> <b>field</b> <b>has</b> historic significance {{as the site of}} the first Grey Cup game in 1909; the CFL lists the game's attendance as 3,807. The field still exists as part of Rosedale Park, although there are no grandstands.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>has</b> been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E

25|$|The Higgs {{mechanism}} {{is a type}} of superconductivity which occurs in the vacuum.
