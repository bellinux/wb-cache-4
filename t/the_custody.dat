Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
