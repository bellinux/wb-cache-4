40|$|Agriculture in the Mojanda Watershed {{is facing}} {{rainfall}} reductions caused by climate change. Reductions of water availability in the Watershed are also due to constant {{extension of the}} agricultural activities into the páramo ecosystem above 3000 m a. s. l., with this ecosystem having immanently important functions in the local water balance. The application of pesticides threatens the quality of water and with less precipitation contaminations will further concentrate in the outflow. To analyze problems associated with agricultural practices in the area a questionnaire about agricultural practices (28) was conducted and fields (20) were surveyed for pests and diseases {{with a focus on}} potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), <b>tree</b> <b>tomatoes</b> (Solanum betaceum Cav.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.). Potatoes were infected to a low degree with Phytophthora infestans and according to the farmers the Andean potato weevil (Premnotrypes spec.) caused biggest losses. To combat the weevil the soils are disinfected with toxic Carbofuran (WHO Class 1 B). <b>Tree</b> <b>tomatoes</b> showed symptoms of various fungal diseases. Most important was Fusarium solani causing the branches to rot and Anthracnosis (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) causing the fruits to rot. Fungicide applications were correspondingly high. Peas were only minorly affected by Ascochyta blight (Mycosphaerella pinodes) and a root rot. Overall 19 active ingredients were applied of which fungicide Mancozeb (WHO class table 5) and insecticide Carbofuran (WHO Class 1 B) were applied the most. Approved IPM methods are advised to reduce pesticide use. For <b>tree</b> <b>tomatoes</b> regular cutting of branches infected with F. solani and regular collection and disposal of infected fruits with Anthracnosis are advised. For potatoes plastic barriers around the fields prevent the Andean potato weevil from laying eggs thus reducing infestation with the larvae in the tubers. Local bioinsecticide “Biol” seems effective and without harm to the environment, although not used by many farmers. Organic fertilization promises to restore decreasing soil fertility, water holding capacity and reduce erosion. The here presented alternatives and strategies to reduce pesticide use pose an opportunity to preserve the water resources of the region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Water status {{plays an}} {{important}} role for fruit quality and quantity in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). However, determination of the plant water status via measurements of sap flow (FH 2 O) or stem diameter (D) cannot be done unambiguously since these variables are influenced by other effectors than the water status. We performed a semi-seasonal and a diurnal analysis of the simultaneous response of FH 2 O and D to environmental conditions, which allowed us to distinguish different influences on DD such as plant age, fruit load and water status and to reveal close diurnal relationships betweenFH 2 O andDD. In addition, an analysis of the diurnal mechanistic link between both variables was done by applying a slightly modified version of a water flow and storage model for <b>trees.</b> <b>Tomato</b> stems, in contrast with trees, seemed to maintain growth while transpiring because a large difference between turgor pressure (Yp) and the yield threshold (G) was maintained. Finally, the simultaneous response of D and FH 2 O on irrigation events showed a possibility to detect water shortages...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>tomato</b> (Solanum betaceum) is {{a poorly}} known species that has fruits with great {{economic}} potential, {{as it can}} be consumed in natura or industrialized. However, for reaching this potential, it is necessary the development of technologies for seedlings production. The propagation of this species is mainly done by seeds, but the seed germination process is usually slow, especially under stress conditions. This study aimed at verifying whether <b>tree</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds have dormancy and which is the best method to obtain fast and uniform germination. A completely randomized design was adopted in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement (methods to overcome dormancy x light), with four replications of 50 or 60 seeds, depending on the production cycle. The methods tested were cold stratification, hydropriming, priming with GA 3 solution and control, with or without light. Seed germination and germination rate index, as well as the beginning and average time of germination, were also evaluated. The use of GA 3 at a concentration of 100 mg L- 1 or 300 mg L- 1 is recommended to the germination of <b>tree</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds...|$|E

The polyphenol concentration increased by 1. 5 times for placenta and 2. 4 times for peel and antioxidant capacity increased by 2. 4 times for both juices. The anthocyanins of placenta increased by 2. 6 times. The use of the resin XA 5071 FG concentrated phenolic compounds with an increase of antioxidant capacity in a range between 4 and 5. 5, and anthocyanins concentration was increased 1. 8 times in the placenta juice.

40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>tomato</b> (Solanum betaceum), family Solanaceae, is an {{economically}} important fruit crop in Ecuador, {{where it is}} grown on 5, 964 ha with a yearly production of 14, 695 tonnes (General System Coordination of National Information, MAGAP, 2012). In September 2015, different commercial <b>tree</b> <b>tomato</b> fields in the Pichincha province showed mosaic and curling of the leaves, as well as stunted growth. Based on symptomatology, infection by Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV, genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae) was suspected. The presence of this virus was ascertained {{in five of the}} eight <b>tree</b> <b>tomato</b> samples screened by DAS-ELISA with a commecial kit (Agdia, USA) and by RT-PCR using PLRV primers (Singh et al., 1995). The resulting (ca. 330 bp) amplicons were purified, custom-sequenced (Marcrogen, South Korea) and the sequences were deposited in GenBank as accession Nos. KU 258499 -KU 258503. Sequence analysis (BioEdit v. 27 7. 05) showed a maximum identity of 99. 6 % and 100 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. A phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA version 4. 1 revealed two clades with the Ecuadorian CMV isolates clustered in clade 1 together with isolates from Colombia (JF 939832 and HQ 396183), Peru (AF 453392), Cuba (S 77421), India (AF 539791), China (KC 456052 and KR 051194), New Zealand (GU 002343) and Australia (D 13953), whereas isolates from Argentina (AF 220151), Germany (JQ 346191), and the USA (KP 090166) formed clade 2. Isolates from Iran (EU 450876) and Brazil (AF 453406) gave rise to clade 3. Based on our findings, the infected crop was eliminated to eradicate the infection.

2500|$|A {{combination}} of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and {{it was found that}} pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6km²) of land of which [...] was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (<b>tree</b> <b>tomatoes)</b> and feijoas.

Spurred on by this Jim planted ½ acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name “Kiwifruit” was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular.
