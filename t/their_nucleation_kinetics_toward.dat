40|$|Aqueous {{suspensions}} of charged {{colloidal particles}} {{have proven to}} be suitable model systems for metals and alloys in order to study the solidification from their respective melts. A major advantage {{is due to the fact}} that the corresponding phenomena occur on spatio-temporal scales which are much more easier to influence and monitor from an experimental point of view. Previous research focused (inter alia) on the phase behaviour and <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of single-component samples. Here we report on experiments particularly devoted to binary mixtures of charged colloidal silica spheres, studying <b>their</b> phase behaviour, <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics,</b> short-range order, as well as possible compound formation and/or phase transformations. For this purpose a set of distinct samples were investigated, consisting of a mono- and polydisperse reference and binary mixtures of large and small monodisperse particles (ratio of diameters dL:dS 2) of varying composition. The measurements mainly involved time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) experiments at the beamline BW 4 at HASYLAB/DESY, Hamburg as well as time-resolved in-house Bragg-microscopy. Both methods were used in order to determine the phase behaviour and <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> for homo- and heterogeneously nucleated colloidal crystals. Control parameters were given by the particle number density and the amount of base (NaOH) added to the suspensions. Preliminary results show a sensitive dependance of the <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics,</b> regarding crystal growth and size, on the composition as well as a re-entrant crystallization behaviour while steadily increasing the relative amount of large particles in a suspension of smaller ones. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} the amount of added grain refiner on grain size and morphology has been investigated for a range of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys. The results show a transition in grain size at a silicon concentration of about 3 wt% in unrefined alloys; the grain size decreasing with silicon content before the transition, and increasing beyond the transition point. A change in morphology also occurs with increased silicon content. The addition of grain refiner leads to greater refinement for silicon contents below the transition point than for those contents above the transition point, while the transition point seems to remain unchanged. The slope of the grain size versus silicon content curve after the transition seems to be unaffected by the degree of grain refinement.

The wide variation in ages of onset among patients with the same repeat length, however, suggests a role for modifying factors. Here we describe the ability of normal-length polyGln repeat sequences to greatly accelerate the <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of an expanded polyGln peptide. We find that normal-length polyGln peptides enhance the in vitro <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> of a Q 47 peptide in a concentration-dependent and repeat-length-dependent manner.

The <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> exhibit high values of nucleation order, ranging from 32 to 10 for nucleation temperatures in the range 19 - 61 degrees C; that is, the generation of nuclei becomes significant only after exceeding a threshold value of supersaturation, which increases as the temperature decreases.

40|$|Wax {{formation}} in diesel and biodiesel fuels at low temperatures {{is one of}} the major problems faced by the fuels industry as crystallisation of the saturated compounds present in these solutions can plug up filters and obstruct pipelines. Preventing wax {{formation in}} these multicomponent mixtures requires a good understanding of the crystallisation behaviour of both n-alkanes and Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAMEs). This work studies solutions of methyl palmitate and stearate in representative mixtures of diesel fuels and unsaturated esters solvents, providing an overall assessment of <b>their</b> solubility and <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics.</b> An in-depth analysis of the growth kinetics and crystal morphology for methyl stearate crystallising from n-dodecane, kerosene and toluene solvents is also presented. To perform this study methodologies are developed for the assessment of <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> and morphological indexation of crystal specific faces. Models for the analysis of crystal growth kinetics are also derived. These describe the effect in series of the diffusion of growth units within the bulk of the solution and a rate of incorporation of these units which is associated to the molecular structure of the crystal faces´ surface. It was found that the solubility and crystallisation kinetics of methyl palmitate and stearate is very dependent on the solution environment in particular solvent type. Solubilities are higher in solvents whose molecules have more compact structures, such as in the case of toluene and methyl-cyclohexane and are lower in unsaturated methyl ester type solvents. The nucleation process in these systems is found to be much more thermodynamically controlled in the case of diesel type solvents and show a greater kinetic influence in the case of unsaturated methyl esters solvents. The growth kinetics of methyl stearate crystals is found to be strongly associated to the level of solvation of these solutes molecules as well as to the chemical structure of the crystal-solution interface. Accordingly, the rate limiting step is suggested to be the integration of growth units to the surface of the crystal in the case of methyl stearate growing from n-dodecane solvent, and more diffusional controlled in the case of methyl stearate growing from kerosene and toluene solvents. The morphology of methyl stearate crystals however is not found to be strongly influenced by solvent type, only showing changes as a function of supersaturation in the case of kerosene solvent. ...|$|R

The elemental composition, structural, surface and size distribution properties of the candidates was compared to micrometeorites and remote measurements of MSPs. Both relatively rare carbonaceous and the more common ordinary chondritic meteorites and terrestrial minerals were shown to be useful analogues for IDPs, whilst synthetic materials were identified as analogues for MSPs. Uptake of HNO 3 and HO 2, based on laboratory experiments, was implemented in a global modelling study.

Understanding the solidification process is essential to control microstructure, which in turn, determines the properties of materials. The genesis of solidification is nucleation, where the first stable solid forms from the liquid phase. <b>Nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> determine the degree of undercooling and phase selection. As such, {{it is important to}} understand nucleation phenomena in order to control solidification or glass formation in metals and alloys. Early experiments in <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> were accomplished by droplet dispersion methods [1 - 6]. Dilitometry was used by Turnbull and others, and more recently differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry have been used for kinetic studies. These techniques have enjoyed success; however, there are difficulties with these experiments. Since materials are dispersed in a medium, the character of the emulsion/metal interface affects the nucleation behavior. Statistics are derived from the large number of particles observed in a single experiment, but dispersions have a finite size distribution which adds to the uncertainty of the kinetic determinations. Even though temperature can be controlled quite well before the onset of nucleation, the release of the latent heat of fusion during nucleation of particles complicates the assumption of isothermality during these experiments. Containerless processing has enabled another approach to the study of <b>nucleation</b> <b>kinetics</b> [7]. With levitation techniques it is possible to undercool one sample to nucleation repeatedly in a controlled manner, such that the statistics of the nucleation process can be derived from multiple experiments on a single sample. The authors have fully developed the analysis of nucleation experiments on single samples following the suggestions of Skripov [8]. The advantage of these experiments is that the samples are directly observable.
