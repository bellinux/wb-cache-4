500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his 'need to know', Sherrington {{states that}} [...] "as a teacher he had himself a wide and devoted following". His ward rounds were often crowded with students, attracted, as Brain puts it, by his [...] "gift of exposition, enthusiasm, {{and sense of}} the dramatic." [...] He endeared people to him with mannerisms which Sherrington states to have been [...] "very symbols of him." [...] One example of Head's {{confidence}} and unflappability occurred when he was listening to a female patient's heart. Without warning the patient <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the doctor and kissed him. Without hesitation, Head turned to his students, telling them calmly that this was [...] "typical, gentlemen, typical".|$|E
2500|$|In April 1919, Rheinschild {{was tried}} and {{found not guilty}} of {{complicity}} in an automobile theft; Rheinschild {{had been accused of}} hiding the automobile after it was stolen by another person. [...] In September 1919, Rheinschild was suspended from the practice of law for 18 months after being accused of unethical conduct in representing both parties in a loan transaction. [...] The Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "tears of mortification" [...] came into his eyes when the suspension was announced, and [...] "his young and attractive wife ran up to him and <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck and tenderly kissed him." [...] Two weeks later, the same judge reversed the suspension. [...] The following month, a different judge ordered Rheinschild disbarred, stating that the action was needed to set an example for other lawyers to restrain from similar conflicts of interest.|$|E
60|$|The landlady {{left the}} room silently. The girl came over to <b>her</b> uncle and <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> his neck.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} his embrace, and <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him, buried <b>her</b> face upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best, my own, my only love!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you dear ninny!" [...] Dora cried, <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him {{and hugging}} him. [...] "Then you saw it, too! I thought {{something}} was the matter, you were acting so strangely." ...|$|R

6000|$|Laws, it was {{out before}} I could think! And before I could budge she <b>throws</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> my neck {{and told me to}} say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN! ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped; she bounded to him, and <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> {{his neck}} with a light laugh, let herself hang for a moment breathless on his breast. Then {{recovering}} her speech she said slowly:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She had <b>thrown</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his knees, {{completely}} pinioning {{him to her}} frantic breast. Something like a {{smile of}} disdain passed across {{his face as he}} answered, [...] "It's nothing. They will not return. Get up!" ...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{suddenly}} <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> {{his neck}} and held her cheek to his.|$|E

5000|$|... "Please, Janie, not {{in front}} of the men!": what Capt. Parmenter says {{whenever}} Wrangler Jane <b>throws</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck and starts kissing him. Sometimes, when the men aren't around, he changes the object of his concern to something nearby...for instance, the horses.|$|R
60|$|Patt darted forward, <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Mary's waist, {{and drew}} {{her into the}} room, closing and locking the door. All this was done {{in a way to}} attract attention, and as if the young lady wished to attract attention. We all smiled but Mary, who seemed half pleased, half frightened.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strong}} {{indication}} of that repressed, considerate habit of mind which love had wrought in the child, that when Mara heard the boy's sobs rising in the stillness, she did not, as she wished to, rush out and <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck and try to comfort him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> his neck. He made no response, nor did {{he thrust}} her away. He {{remained}} quite passive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad you're going out; and here,"--and {{the little}} girl <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> her,--"Mammy, you shall take my vinaigrette." ...|$|E
60|$|She squealed with delight, and, manifestly {{surrendering}} to a long-considered temptation, she <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> {{his neck and}} hugged him close.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} my charge," [...] said the Lady; and again <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> the boy, she {{overwhelmed}} him with kisses and caresses, so much was she agitated by the terror {{arising from the}} danger {{in which he had}} been just placed, and by joy at his unexpected deliverance.|$|R
50|$|In her delight, Echo {{rushed to}} Narcissus ready to <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> beloved. Narcissus, however, was appalled and, spurning her, exclaimed, ‘Hands off! May I die before you enjoy my body.’ All Echo could whisper in reply was, ‘enjoy my body’ and having done so she fled, scorned, humiliated, and shamed.|$|R
5000|$|Turiddu rushes out. Lucia, weeping, wanders aimlessly {{around outside}} her house. Santuzza {{approaches}} and <b>throws</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> The villagers start to crowd around. Voices are {{heard in the}} distance and a woman cries, [...] "They have murdered Turiddu!" [...] Santuzza faints and Lucia collapses in the arms of the women villagers.|$|R

60|$|Never {{before had}} Miss Panney's soul been so stung, burned, and lacerated, all at once, as by this laugh. But the sound had {{scarcely}} left Dora Bannister's lips when she bounded {{out of the}} carriage and ran after the old lady. <b>Throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, she {{kissed her on the}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached for}} his hat {{and started for the}} door. He did not offer to kiss her--he never did on going out--but on this night she dared to kiss him, <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him and {{compelling}} him to bend down to her face. She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man.|$|R
60|$|Louise slowly {{opened her}} eyes, smiled divinely, and <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> impulsively <b>around</b> his neck.|$|R

50|$|When Glen discovers this, he attacks Bone at her Aunt Alma's house, {{breaking}} <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and raping <b>her</b> on {{the kitchen}} floor. Anney walks in on him and fights him off. Glen follows the two out to the car, begging Anney to kill him rather than abandon him. To Bone's disgust and amazement, Anney ends up crying and <b>throwing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> Glen.|$|R
5000|$|The Cannon Coaster {{has also}} been noted in {{historical}} sources for the marketing which was employed to attract riders. The coaster owners utilized the excitement associated with roller coasters to hint at the amorous possibilities for young couples riding the coaster. One advertisement posed the question to riders: [...] "Will she <b>throw</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> your neck and yell? Well, I guess yes!" ...|$|R
