60|$|At my alighting, I was {{surrounded}} with {{a crowd of}} people, but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality. They beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances. Their heads were all reclined, either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith. Their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe. I observed, here and there, many {{in the habit of}} servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like a flail {{to the end of a}} stick, which they carried in their hands. In each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed. With these bladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could not then conceive the meaning. It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some external <b>taction</b> upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is climenole) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him. And the business of this officer is, when two, three, or more persons are in company, gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself. This flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in the streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the kennel.|$|E

The first sensory substitution system was developed by Bach-y-Rita et al. as a means of brain plasticity in congenitally blind individuals. After this historic invention, sensory substitution has been the basis of many studies investigating perceptive and cognitive neuroscience. Since then, sensory substitution has contributed to the study of brain function, human cognition and rehabilitation.|$|E

Several investigators have recently developed tactile sensing arrays suitable for imaging shapes on hard flat surfaces, but not well suited for <b>taction</b> on curved surfaces.

40|$|Vision {{and touch}} {{have proved to}} be {{powerful}} sensing modalities in humans. In order to build robots capable of complex behavior, analogues of human vision and <b>taction</b> need to be created. In addition, strategies for intelligent use of these sensors in tasks such as object recognition need to be developed. Two overriding principles that dictate a good strategy for cooperative use of these sensors are the following: 1) sensors should complement each other in the kind and quality of data they report, and 2) each sensor system be used in the most robust manner possible. We demonstrate this with a contour following algorithm that recovers the shape of surfaces of revolution from sparse tactile sensor data. The absolute location in depth of an object can be found more accurately through touch than vision; but the global properties of where to actively explore with the hand are better found through vision...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Grains in polycrystals {{differ in}} their size and shape. The {{geometry}} of grains in a given polycrystal is described by the distribution tactions of grain size and shape. These tactions can be experimentally studied using the methods of quantitative stereology and image analysis. The geometry of grains {{is related to the}} physical properties of the grain boundaries and vice versa The distribution <b>taction</b> of the geometrical features of grains can help in the assessment of the physical properties of the grain boundaries. Distribution tactions of grains size and shape were investigated in an UHP iron produced at EMSE and in a commeKially available Armco iron. Populations of grains in the specimens studied were characterized in terms of mean grain volume E(V), grain section area,E(A) and the grain size diversity ratio. The data obtained in the study provide a quantitative description of the evolution in the geometry of grains during recrystallization and grain growth It was fcund that there are systematic difleences in the geometrical featmes of grains in UHP iron and Armco iron.

40|$|Brief tactile presses {{stimulated the}} index and middle {{fingers of the}} right and left hands. The {{stimulation}} on each hand consisted of a triplet of presses. Each triplet was composed of a brief press to one finger (e. g., the middle finger), followed by a brief press to the other finger (e. g., the index finger), and by a final simultaneous press to both fingers of a given hand. With equal probability, a triplet could begin with the index or middle finger, and either 360 ms or 800 ms later another triplet stimulated fingers on the other hand. The task was to indicate which finger was stimulated first in each triplet. In four experiments, response accuracy to the second triplet revealed an attentional blink in <b>taction,</b> that is, responses were less accurate at the short triplettriplet interval than at the long triplettriplet interval. This effect was substantially reduced when the first triplet could be ignored.

40|$|While Iranian {{foreign policy}} making since the 1979 {{revolution}} has been erratic and even {{hostile to the}} interests of the United States, it has been anything but irrational and unintelligible. This thesis argues that Iranian foreign policy making is not enigmatic but rather can be understood in a systematic and rational manner. The key to understanding Iranian foreign policy making is the notion of factional politics in an unconsolidated polity. Put briefly, Than has lacked a consistent and decisive center of power, leaving foreign policy-making in the hands of various elite factions. The seemingly erratic nature of Iran's actions is explained by noting which <b>taction</b> is behind various policies. Seemingly self-defeating foreign policies have often been designed for domestic political advantage. Foreign policy, like domestic policy, is a tool for advantage in Iran's factional power struggle-conclusions directly at odds with Neo-Realist theory. President Khatami's pursuit of liberalization and rapprochement with the U. S. has highlighted the factional component of Iranian policy making. Understanding Iranian policy in this manner leads to a logical conclusion for U. S. policy makers: Khatami's overtures are genuine and strategic, not only because they will help Iran forward but also because the will help Khatami remain in power. NAU. S. Air Force (U. S. A.

40|$|Smell is {{probably}} the least understood and exploited of the principal human senses, yet it is clearly important to both product and process control in many industries, such as foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco and perfumery. Advances {{in the field of}} integrated microelectronic devices have led to new instruments, robots, capable of vision and complex touch or <b>taction,</b> but not yet of smell. This paper reviews the research effort that has been carried out at Warwick University over recent years into the development of an electronic instrument that can mimic the human sense of smell. The approach that we have adopted is to construct a microprocessor-controlled system comprising an array of solid-state chemical gas sensors (with overlapping partial sensitivities to odorants) and associated signal processing and pattern recognition. This electronic system is based upon our present knowledge of the biological system. Our earliest electronic nose consisted of an array of only three to twelve tin dioxide thick-film sensors, yet it can discriminate between alcohols, beverages, tobacco blends and coffees. Current efforts are reported towards the fabrication of an integrated microsensor metal oxide array, the development of other electronic devices using polymeric materials, and the implementation of various pattern-recognition techniques, including correlation, principal-component analysis, cluster analysis and artificial neural networks. Finally, the application areas most likely to arouse widespread interest in the next decade are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Feedback of {{sensation}} {{has long been}} the dream of developers (and wearers) of prosthetic hands, and many earlier efforts have made progress, but never a practical commercially-available sys-tem. Although grip force feedback (GFF) is an obvious shortcoming in a hand prosthesis, it has been slow to develop because of the innate difficulties of providing consistent and accurate feed-back information to the wearer of an electric hand. A truly useful GFF system must provide, 1) true clinical relevance (we feel it should demonstrably improve control of grip force, contribute to a more natural feel, and represent an acceptable ratio of cost to benefits provided), and 2) tech-nically provide a practical system which can operate for months reliably, and be small enough to install into a cosmetic-looking prosthesis. Early development was conducted at the University of Utah in the 1980 ’s, (Ref. 1) resulting in a concept termed: Extended Physiological <b>Taction</b> (EPT) in which the feedback of pinch force was presented to the TD wearer (in laboratory experiments) via a “pusher motor”, providing a force against the wearer’s skin proportional to the gripping force of the TD. The “mock prosthesis” shown in Figure 1 (left) allowed experiments to be conducted, with non-amputee subjects, to verify the improvement of grip force control by a myoelectric controlled TD, using a TD wit...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{application}} of artificial neural networks to low level processing of tactile sensory data. In analogy to the term early msion, we call the first level of processing required in tactile sensing early <b>taction.</b> Associated with almost all existing realizations of tactile sensors, are fundamental inverse problems which must be solved. Solutions to these inverse problems are computationally demanding. Among such inverse problems, {{is the problem of}} 'deblurring' or deconvolution of data provided by any array of tactile sensors which is also assumed to be corrupted by noise. We note that this inverse problem is ill-posed and that the technique of regularization may be used to obtain solutions. The theory of nonlinear electrical networks is utilized to describe ene~y functions for a ~lass of nonlinear networks and to show that the equilibrium states of the proposed network correspond to ~r~d solutions of the delurring problem. An entropy regularizer is incorporated into the energy function of the network for the recovery of normal stress distributions. It is demonstrated by means of both computer simulations and hardware prototypes that neural networks provide an elegant solution to the need for fast, local computation in tactile sensing. An integrated circuit prototype of the proposed network which has been designed and fabricated is discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|A main {{challenge}} in the therapy of drug dependent individuals is to help them reactivate interest in non-drug-associated activities. We previously developed a rat experimental model based on the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in which only four 15 -min episodes of social interaction with a gender- and weight-matched male Sprague Dawley rat (1) reversed CPP from cocaine to social interaction despite continuing cocaine training and (2) prevented the reinstatement of cocaine CPP. In the present study, we investigated which of the sensory modalities of the composite stimulus “social interaction” contributes most to the rats' preference for it. If touch was limited by steel bars spaced {{at a distance of}} 2 cm and running across the whole length of a partitioning, CPP was still acquired, albeit to a lesser degree. If both rats were placed {{on the same side of}} a partitioning, rats did not develop CPP for social interaction. Thus, decreasing the available area for social interaction from 750 to 375 cm 2 prevented the acquisition of CPP to social interaction despite the fact that animals could touch each other more intensely than through the bars of the partitioning. When touch was fully restricted by a glass screen dividing the conditioning chambers, and the only sensory modalities left were visual and olfactory cues, place preference shifted to place aversion. Overall, our findings indicate that the major rewarding sensory component of the composite stimulus “social interaction” is touch (<b>taction)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} developed rat experimental models {{based on}} the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in which only four 15 -min episodes of dyadic social interaction with a sex- and weight-matched male Sprague Dawley rat (1) reversed CPP from cocaine to social interaction despite continuing cocaine training, and (2) prevented the reacquisition/re-expression of cocaine CPP. In a concurrent conditioning schedule, pairing one compartment with social interaction and the other compartment with 15 mg/kg cocaine injections, rats spent {{the same amount of}} time in both compartments and the most rewarding sensory component of the composite stimulus social interaction was touch (<b>taction).</b> In the present study, we validated our experimental paradigm in C 57 BL/ 6 mice to investigate if our experimental paradigm may be useful for the considerable number of genetically modified mouse models. Only 71 % of the tested mice developed place preference for social interaction, whereas 85 % of the rats did. Accordingly, 29 % of the mice developed conditioned place aversion to social interaction, whereas this was true for only 15 % of the rats. In support of the lesser likelihood of mice to develop a preference for social interaction, the average amount of time spent in direct contact was 17 % for mice vs 79 % for rats. In animals that were concurrently conditioned for social interaction vs cocaine, the relative reward strength for cocaine was 300 -fold higher in mice than in rats. Considering that human addicts regularly prefer drugs of abuse to drug-free social interaction, the present findings suggest that our experimental paradigm of concurrent CPP for cocaine vs social interaction is of even greater translational power if performed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, the genetic background for most transgenic rodent models, than in rats...|$|E
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} both grip {{function}} and tactile perception depend on complex frictional interactions {{occurring in the}} contact zone of the finger pad, which {{is the subject of}} the current review. While it is well established that friction plays a crucial role in grip function, its exact contribution for discriminatory touch involving the sliding of a finger pad is more elusive. For texture discrimination, it is clear that vibrotaction {{plays an important role in}} the discriminatory mechanisms. Among other factors, friction impacts the nature of the vibrations generated by the relative movement of the fingertip skin against a probed object. Friction also has a major influence on the perceived tactile pleasantness of a surface. The contact mechanics of a finger pad is governed by the fingerprint ridges and the sweat that is exuded from pores located on these ridges. Counterintuitively, the coefficient of friction can increase by an order of magnitude in a period of tens of seconds when in contact with an impermeably smooth surface, such as glass. In contrast, the value will decrease for a porous surface, such as paper. The increase in friction is attributed to an occlusion mechanism and can be described by first-order kinetics. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the coefficient of friction to the normal load and sliding velocity is comparatively of second order, yet these dependencies provide the main basis of theoretical models which, to-date, largely ignore the time evolution of the frictional dynamics. One well-known effect on <b>taction</b> is the possibility of inducing stick–slip if the friction decreases with increasing sliding velocity. Moreover, the initial slip of a finger pad occurs by the propagation of an annulus of failure from the perimeter of the contact zone and this phenomenon could be important in tactile perception and grip function...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} molecules {{are involved}} in adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and other immune cells. Not only adhesion molecules have membrane form, {{but they also have}} soluble form. In this paper, we attempted to investigate the concen¬tration of soluble adhesion molecules in the type 1 diabetic patients (n = 40) and healthy subjects (n = 10). The results indicated that there was an increase in the concentration of soluble adhesion molecules: sICAM- 1, sVCAM- 1 and sELAM- 1, in the sera of diabetic patients rather than the healthy ones (p = 0 / 00). Increased concentration of sVCAM- 1 with the insulin injection dose (p = 0. 01) and sIC AM- 1 with duration of disease (p = 0. 05) indicated significant reversel linear con-elation in the patients' groups. Also, sELAM- 1 with sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1 showed significant direct linear correlation in the same group (p ~ 0. 01). Adhesion mol¬ecules were determined by the sandwich ELIS A principle. One of the most important factors in the development of atherosclerosis is the ad¬hesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. Tlierefore, in this study, the percentage of expression of membrane form of VCAM- 1, not ICAM- 1, was increased on 10000 monocytes of diabetic patients type- 1 (n = 20) in comparison with normal subjects (n = 20, p ~ 0. 05). The expression tensive of membrane form of CAMs on the surface of monocytes was performed by flowcytometry technique. We concluded that the increase in sICAM- 1, sVCAM- 1 specially sELAM- 1 and also mVCAM- 1 indicated endothelial activation, stimulatability of leukocyte cells and increased interaction to endothelial cells. Although, scientists are not aware about the role of elevated CAMs concentration, it can be suggested that the in¬creasing level of sICAM- 1, sVCAM- 1, sELAM- 1 and mVCAM may reflect cel¬lular expression, <b>taction</b> of CAMs in autoimmune disease and also provide a po¬tential therapeutic target for human IDDM...|$|E
