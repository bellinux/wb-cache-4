Plants were evaluated for visible foliar injury symptoms and symptoms were described and photographically documented. Ten of the 27 species developed visible foliar injury in which interspecific and intraspecific response to O 3 was observed. A severity index was used to compare response to acute ozone exposure for the ten species displaying visible foliar injury. Species showing visible foliar injury in descending order of severity index were Coreopsis tripteris L. (tall tickseed), Coreopsis palmata Nutt. (stiff tickseed), Penstemon cobaea Nutt. (cobaea beardtongue), Solidago nemoralis Aiton (gray goldenrod), Monarda fistulosa L. (wild bergamot), Silphium integrifolium Michx (wholeleaf rosinweed), Oligoneuron rigidum (L.) Small var. rigidum (stiff goldenrod), Rudbeckia missouriensis Engelm. ex C. L. Boynt. (Missouri orange coneflower), Penstemon pallidus Small (pale beardtongue), and Solidago speciosa Nutt. (showy goldenrod). A range of symptoms was observed including red to purple stipple and tan to yellow or brown flecking; bronzing, leaf margin necrosis, and bifacial necrotic lesions. Subsequently, in June of 2011, four native Coreopsis species (C. lanceolata, C. palmata, C. tinctoria, and C. tripteris), were exposed to four acute ozone (O 3) treatment levels with <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> O 3 concentrations of 1. 2, 1. 7, 2. 2, and 2. 7 ppm, for 30 minutes in a closed chamber environment.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a new algorithm for charge state determination of complex isotope-resolved mass spectra. This algorithm {{is based on}} peak-target Fourier transform (PTFT) of isotope packets. It is modified from the widely used Fourier transform method because Fourier transform may give ambiguous charge state assignment for low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) or overlapping isotopic clusters. The PTFT algorithm applies a novel “folding” strategy to enhance peaks that are symmetrically spaced about the <b>targeted</b> <b>peak</b> before applying the FT. The “folding” strategy multiplies each point to the high-m/z side of the <b>targeted</b> <b>peak</b> by its counterpart on the low-m/z side. A Fourier transform of this “folded” spectrum is thus simplified, emphasizing the charge state of the “chosen” ion, whereas ions of other charge states contribute less to the transformed data. An intensity-dependent technique is also proposed for charge state determination from frequency signals. The performance of PTFT is demonstrated using experimental electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectra. The results show that PTFT is robust for charge state determination of low S/N and overlapping isotopic clusters, and also useful for manual verification of potential hidden isotopic clusters that may be missed by the current analysis algorithms, i. e., AID-MS or THRASH...|$|R

The system analyzes a saturation absorption spectrum to find a <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> and commands a laser-frequency-control circuit to minimize an error signal representing the difference between the laser frequency and the <b>target</b> <b>peak.</b> The program implements an algorithm consisting of the following steps: Acquire a saturation absorption signal while scanning the laser through the frequency range of interest. Condition the signal by use of convolution filtering. Detect peaks. Match the peaks in the signal to a pattern of known spectral peaks by use of a pattern-recognition algorithm. Add missing peaks. Tune the laser to the desired peak and thereafter lock onto this peak. Finding and locking onto the desired peak is a challenging problem, given that the saturation absorption signal includes noise and other spurious signal components; the problem is further complicated by nonlinearity and shifting of the voltage-to-frequency correspondence. The pattern-recognition algorithm, which is based on Hausdorff distance, is what enables the program to meet these challenges...|$|E
30|$|Both {{the window}} size for the {{baseline}} DC estimation {{and the window}} size for the short-term variance for the sub-profile have a marked impact {{on the performance of}} the algorithm. It is expected that large window sizes for baseline DC estimation would improve the DC estimation in cases where the background changes monotonically (as for signals of types 2 - 4). Too large a DC estimation window size might, in some cases, lead to inaccurate tracking of the clutter form and cause high false alarm rates (e.g., as for type 1 signals). Thus, for background profiles, the optimal window size is determined by the background type, i.e., for a noise-dominated background or backgrounds containing monotonically changing clutter, larger window sizes are preferred; for backgrounds characterized by rapidly changing clutter, shorter windows are preferred. For target temporal profiles, the larger the DC window, the higher the profile score, since the presence of the <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> will have a smaller influence on the DC estimation. Obviously, an estimated DC that tracks the target form is highly undesirable since it leads to target suppression. Thus, in terms of the overall algorithm performance, the optimal DC window is the one that is small enough to closely track background changes but is large enough not to track the <b>target</b> <b>peak.</b>|$|E

This study aimed to assess the predictive performance of these nomograms in Korean patients. Methods: Gentamicin concentrations were determined in 84 patients with infective endocarditis (IE) and in 95 patients with other infections. All patients underwent therapeutic drug monitoring in Seoul National University Hospital from 2006 to 2012. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian method, which predicted steady state peak and trough serum concentrations. Six nomograms were evaluated in patients with "other" infections: the Thomson guidelines, Hull-Sarubbi table, and Rule of Eights, for multiple daily dosing; and the Hartford nomogram, Barnes-Jewish Hospital nomogram, and Sanford Guide, for extended-interval dosing. In IE patients, synergistic combination dosing nomograms, based on the American Heart Association dosing interval guidelines, were evaluated. Results: Gentamicin dosing nomograms performed poorly in attaining the <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> serum concentrations. Multiple-daily dosing nomograms predicted peak serum gentamicin concentrations better than did the extended-interval dosing nomograms (31. 9 %– 72. 3 % vs 4. 3 %– 45. 7 %, respectively). Similarly, in patients with IE, the once-daily dosing nomogram resulted in a significantly lower percentage of patients achieving <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> gentamicin concentrations than that associated with the thrice-daily dosing nomogram (P= 0. 0015). All of the multiple-daily dosing, extended-interval dosing, and synergistic combination dosing nomograms predicted the nontoxic target trough concentrations in > 80 % of patients.

In memory based reconfigurable computing frameworks, which use large high density memory array, such failures lead to incorrect execution of mapped applications.

We propose a “Preferential Design ” approach at both application mapping and circuit level, which can significantly improve QoS and yield under large parameter variations.

Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} thesis. Passive radar (PR) systems attract interests in radar community {{due to its}} lower cost and power consumption over conventional radars. However, {{one of the main}} disadvantages of a PR system is its low range resolution. The reason for this is, the range resolution depends on the bandwidth of the transmitted waveform and in a PR scenario, it is impossible to change transmitted waveform properties of a commercial broadcast. In this thesis, a post processing scheme is proposed to improve the range resolution of an FM broadcast based PR system. In the post processing scheme, the output of the ambiguity function is re-expressed as convolution of the autocorrelation of the transmitted signal and a channel impulse response. Therefore, it is shown {{that it is possible to}} use deconvolution methods to compute the channel impulse response using the output of the ambiguity function and the autocorrelation of the transmitted signal. Thus, using deconvolution to solve the channel impulse response provides an increase in the range resolution of the PR system. The method successfully increases the target separation distance and range resolution of a PR system using single FM channel signal. The conventional ambiguity function is able to separate two targets when the targets have about 17 km between each other where as the deconvolution based post processing method can decrease this to about 10 km. The deconvolution based post processing methods also decreases the side lobes around the target when the system uses multi channel FM signals. For a scenario in which three FM channels are employed, the highest side lobe is 1. 2 dB below the main <b>target</b> <b>peak</b> and after deconvolution, this highest side lobe decreases to about 10 dB below the main <b>target</b> <b>peak.</b> Musa Tunç Arslan.
