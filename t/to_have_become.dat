5|$|P. l. sinhaleyus, {{known as}} the Sri Lanka lion, appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct around 39,000 years ago. It is only known from two teeth found in {{deposits}} at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.|$|E

5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 {{miles per hour}} (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, well {{to the north of}} Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

5000|$|Haciendas {{of central}} Chile are {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> labour-saturated by 1780 generating an [...] "excess" [...] population {{that could not}} be incorporated into their economy. Some of this population settled in the outskirts of larger cities while other migrated to the mining districts of Norte Chico.|$|R

5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, {{there is no evidence}} that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Beaumont {{was fully}} {{involved}} in the political crises that punctuated the reign of Henry VI: Griffiths has labelled him one of 'a small group of like-minded men, led by Suffolk' who could work for the king whether in council or on royal progress, although his attendance at council seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> more sporadic by 1443. As Steward of England, he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of Salisbury- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447.|$|E
5|$|Broad {{interest}} in metformin was not rekindled until {{the withdrawal of}} the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on March 3, 1995. Generic formulations are now available in several countries, and metformin is believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug.|$|E

50|$|An {{examination}} of the tigress’ body showed that her claws and one canine tooth were broken and her front teeth were completely worn down. It was these disabilities that Corbett concluded led this tigress <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>become</b> a man eater as it was thus hampered in killing wild game.|$|R
5|$|Cornelius had no {{luck with}} the MacLean leadership, who {{remained}} Episcopalian, but the (small) population of Rùm does appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> Roman Catholic again. In {{the rest of the}} nation, Covenanters gradually gained political control. Coll (along with the lands of the MacLeans of Duart) was under the shrieval authority of the sheriff of Argyll; under pressure from the Earl of Argyll, {{one of the most powerful}} Covenanter leaders, shrieval authority over Rùm was transferred from Inverness to the Argyll sheriff, which was under the control of the Earl's family.|$|E

He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for the {{following}} eight years, but by 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> entrenched against each other. The laconic account of these developments in the Primary Chronicle makes {{the course of events}} far from transparent. Vasilko and Vladimir Rostislavich, two Galcia-based princes unhappy with territorial settlement under Vsevolod, were said to have attempted to expel Yaropolk in 1084, but Grand Prince Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh drove these Rostislavchi away.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E
50|$|Globally, the New Caledonian {{endemic species}} C. crassivalvis <b>has</b> <b>become</b> extinct {{according}} <b>to</b> the IUCN's 1998 assessment. Seven species endemic <b>to</b> New Caledonia <b>have</b> <b>become</b> endangered with global extinction {{according to the}} IUCN's 1998 assessments. Five species endemic to New Guinea, one endemic to New Caledonia and one endemic <b>to</b> Sulawesi <b>have</b> <b>become</b> vulnerable <b>to</b> global extinction according to the IUCN's 1998 and 2010 assessments.|$|R

5|$|Subtropical {{cyclones}} with hurricane-force {{winds of}} greater than 33m/s, (119km/h, 64knots, or 74mph) are not officially {{recognized by the}} National Hurricane Center. Once a subtropical storm intensifies enough to have hurricane-force winds, then it is automatically assumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a fully tropical hurricane. Despite this however, {{prior to the start}} of modern policies two systems in the Atlantic hurricane database attained hurricane-force winds as a subtropical cyclone; a subtropical storm in 1968, and a subtropical storm in 1979.|$|E
5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of amphibians at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in Montana concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians do seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E
