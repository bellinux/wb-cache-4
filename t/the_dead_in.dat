5|$|Expecting an {{imminent}} {{continuation of the}} battle, three Allied brigades arrived within twenty-four hours to reinforce the beachhead, but no subsequent attack materialised. Instead, on 20 and 24 May two truces were declared to collect the wounded and bury <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> no man's land. The Turks never succeeded in capturing the bridgehead; instead the ANZACs evacuated the position {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemics and {{the findings of a}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>in</b> the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851.

5|$|Most of the British and German {{dead from}} the Battle of Mons were {{initially}} buried in church and local cemeteries in Mons and surrounding villages {{rather than a}} purpose built military cemetery. Subsequently, the German Army decided to exhume and re-inter <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> a single location, as they determined the care and maintenance of a isolated graves was unsustainable over the long term.|$|E

5|$|Sadler {{believed}} that mediums were {{a source of}} false comfort and, after World WarI ended, fought against the increased popularity of communication with <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> <b>In</b> the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly worked with a Northwestern University psychologist and Howard Thurston, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics. Sadler may have met the magician Harry Houdini (who was also a skeptic) around this time.|$|E
5|$|Several {{memorials}} were erected {{to commemorate}} <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> <b>In</b> Silver Spring, a plaque {{was placed on}} a bridge above the crash site. In Brunswick, there is a stone with the names and pictures of the three CSX crewmen engraved on it. The stone was paid for by private donations. The eight passengers who died were all students at the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Center. Students there erected a memorial flanked by weeping cherry trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E

5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>in</b> their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 1990s, after the {{completion}} of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of <b>the</b> <b>dead)</b> <b>in</b> 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>in</b> Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, Virginia, 125 Pentagon workers {{lost their}} lives when Flight 77 crashed into {{the western side of}} the building. Of these, 70 were civilians and 55 were {{military}} personnel, many of them who worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy. The Army lost 47 civilian employees, six civilian contractors, and 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six civilian employees, three civilian contractors, and 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) civilian employees were also among <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the attack, as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) contractor. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemic and {{the findings of the}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>in</b> the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London. Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or {{were in the process of}} opening, and temporarily became London's main burial grounds. A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval, and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Koine Greek {{had become}} the common {{language}} of the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor after the conquests of Alexander the Great. Lucian even imagines that Greek is the universal language of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> the underworld. In late antiquity, a Greek-speaking majority lived in the Greek peninsula and islands, major cities of the East, western Anatolia, and some coastal areas. Greek continued as {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, and developed into a distinctive medieval Greek that gave rise to modern Greek.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>in</b> and around the station. Mostly foam {{was used as the}} main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E
