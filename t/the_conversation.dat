5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> in depth, while options on the right side tend to move <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

They suggest that problems in communication can be identified by looking at the ‘trigger 2 ̆ 7 and the ‘indicator 2 ̆ 7 of problems in <b>conversations.</b> <b>The</b> analysis of <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> indicated that <b>the</b> guide and the tourist in their conversations were actively engaged in the topic. They gave opinions, contributed to <b>the</b> <b>conversations,</b> and provided information to the topic. The analysis also indicated that there were four types of indicators of communication problems: (1) explicit questions, (2) clarification requests, (3) confirmation checks, and (4) rephrasing...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> of two currently used textbooks in Iranian context (Top Notch and ILI textbooks) on the basis of two frameworks of Halliday(1978) and Cohen(1996) to determine features of the books in general and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} them, in particular. For this purpose, two levels (Basic& Intermediate) were selected and two pragmatic models of Halliday and Cohen were applied to analyze them. The researcher codified each speech acts and language functions in <b>the</b> <b>conversations.</b> <b>The</b> researcher concluded that the absence of one of the speech acts and language functions in <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> of <b>the</b> two previously mentioned textbooks can be regarded as a weak point of these textbooks. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> in <b>the</b> two textbooks have some pragmatic problems with regard to language functions and speech acts. </p...|$|R

The study was carried out acting as a qualitative observational study in a science class in general studies program option at a public secondary school.

When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> the bond statistic with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E
