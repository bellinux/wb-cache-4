25|$|Sharp {{pronounced}} {{declines in}} tropical euglossine bee populations {{at both the}} native and human-managed levels, have raised serious concerns over a possible global pollination crisis. Since many <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> taxa, especially flowering orchid plants, strongly rely on euglossine bee pollinators for cross-fertilization, declining euglossine bee populations could lead to widespread pollen limitation and low reproductive rates. This decline is most likely attributable to human activity such as habitat disturbance—habitat degradation, pervasive pesticide use, pathogen spillover, forest fragmentation, and climatic alteration.|$|E

Animal fat, particularly from ruminants, tends {{to have a higher}} percentage of saturated fat vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats, with the exception of some <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> fats; consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems. The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption.|$|E
500|$|Conservationists {{concerned}} about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was Charles Torrey Simpson, who retired from the Smithsonian Institution to Miami in 1905 when he was 53. Nicknamed [...] "the Sage of Biscayne Bay", Simpson wrote several books about <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> life around Miami. His backyard contained a tropical hardwood hammock, which he estimated he showed to about 50,000people. Though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development, in Ornamental Gardening in Florida he wrote, [...] "Mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and beautiful things this nature has lavished upon him".|$|E

500|$|Under the Jennisons, {{the main}} {{priorities}} for Belle Vue were the zoological and botanical gardens; amusements were provided {{merely as a}} distraction. The Jennisons laid out formal gardens in various styles between 1836 and 1898, including mazes, grottoes, an Italian garden, [...] "billiard-table lawns" [...] and constructed <b>Tropical</b> <b>Plant</b> Houses. There were also exotic constructions like the Indian temple and grotto, designed by George Danson, Belle Vue's scenic artist. Built to resemble a ruined temple, it housed snakes and crocodiles as well as flowers. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, [...] "the resort relied almost entirely for its attraction on its delightful gardens", but by 1931 the formalism had entirely disappeared. The gardens were also used to stage large political rallies for a wide spectrum of opinion, such as the Great Liberal Demonstration of 1924, at which Lloyd George addressed a crowd of 50,000, the first political meeting at which loudspeakers were used. The British Union of Fascists, popularly known as the Blackshirts, also held a meeting there, in September 1934. One contemporary commentator observed that [...] "perhaps the Ku Klux Klan will be found in session there one day, for Belle Vue is nothing if not [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Colocasia esculenta {{is thought}} to be native to Southern India and Southeast Asia, but is widely naturalised.

Colocasia {{is thought to}} have originated in the Indomalaya ecozone, perhaps in East India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, and spread by cultivation eastward into Southeast Asia, East Asia and the Pacific Islands; westward to Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean Basin; and then southward and westward from there into East Africa and West Africa, where it spread to the Caribbean and Americas. It is known by many local names and often referred to as [...] "elephant ears" [...] when grown as an ornamental plant.|$|E

2500|$|Seeing this, out of dissatisfaction, Pu Tong Seal {{added to}} his demands. This time, the demands were not of {{material}} wealth, but of rarities. He demanded a 54-foot-long [...] "Takok", which is a <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> known to laymen as [...] "fern" [...] but also known as pteridophyte scientifically, and a full cup of extremely tiny flies known as thosi locally. Surprisingly, the Burmans managed to collect a full cup of tiny flies but it seemed impossible to find a takok plant that was 54 feet long. As fate, luck and destiny play important roles in our everyday lives, the Burmans at last found a 54-foot-long takok, {{on top of a}} huge dead jungle tree. They cut down the tree to get the takok and paid the final ransom for their anxious king. At last Pu Tong Seal released La King as a gesture of upholding his promise.|$|E
2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E

60|$|The {{tension between}} James {{and his parents}} became not less, but greater. That barrier which, almost from the beginning, they had watched with pain rise up between them now seemed indestructible, and all their efforts only made it more obvious and more stable.

60|$|The {{heat was}} great, {{the air was}} still, all the long windows of the house stood wide open. At the further end, grouped round a lady’s work-table, several chairs {{disposed}} sociably suggested invisible occupants, a company of conversing shades. Renouard looked towards them {{with a sort of}} dread. A most elusive, faint sound of ghostly talk issuing from one of the rooms added to the illusion and stopped his already hesitating footsteps. He leaned over the balustrade of stone near a squat vase holding a <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> of a bizarre shape. Professor Moorsom coming up from the garden with a book under his arm and a white parasol held over his bare head, found him there and, closing the parasol, leaned over by his side with a remark on the increasing heat of the season. Renouard assented and changed his position a little; the other, after a short silence, administered unexpectedly a question which, like the blow of a club on the head, deprived Renouard of the power of speech and even thought, but, more cruel, left him quivering with apprehension, not of death but of everlasting torment. Yet the words were extremely simple.|$|E
6000|$|As Wordsworth's work is {{too often}} marred by the moralizer, and Byron's by the demagogue, and Shelley's by the reformer, so Keats's work suffers by the {{opposite}} extreme of aloofness from every human interest; so much so, that he is often accused of being indifferent to humanity. His work is also criticised as being too effeminate for ordinary readers. Three things should be remembered in this connection. First, that Keats sought to express beauty for its own sake; that beauty is as essential to normal humanity as is government or law; and that the higher man climbs in civilization the more imperative becomes his need of beauty {{as a reward for}} his labors. Second, that Keats's letters are as much an indication of the man as is his poetry; and in his letters, with their human sympathy, their eager interest in social problems, their humor, and their keen insight into life, there is no trace of effeminacy, but rather every indication of a strong and noble manhood. The third thing to remember is that all Keats's work was done in three or four years, with small preparation, and that, dying at twenty-five, he left us a body of poetry which will always be one of our most cherished possessions. He is often compared with [...] "the marvelous boy" [...] Chatterton, whom he greatly admired, and to whose memory he dedicated his Endymion; but though both died young, Chatterton was but a child, while Keats was in all respects a man. It is idle to prophesy what he might have done, had he been granted a Tennyson's long life and scholarly training. At twenty five his work was as mature as was Tennyson's at fifty, though the maturity suggests the too rapid growth of a <b>tropical</b> <b>plant</b> which under the warm rains and the flood of sunlight leaps into life, grows, blooms in a day, and dies.|$|E
