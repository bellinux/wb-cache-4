5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade. The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large hydroelectricity project in highland Victoria.|$|E
5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians woke him early so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E

25|$|Rett was {{supposed}} to help Deshwitat during his battle against Kalutika. He {{was too late to}} help, and tried to avenge his friend, but was severely wounded, and his men were killed. Kalutika made Rett immortal so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the Armageddon.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, on Elwood, {{said to a}} {{reporter}} on November 1 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the light on the}} car, and from the sound, he thought it was moving fast across the bridge, and the motorman might not realize that the draw was open.|$|E
60|$|She turned quite pale, even in <b>that</b> light <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her pallor, and {{her hands}} fell heavily on the keys.|$|R

25|$|In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Iapetus only on {{the west}} side of Saturn and never on the east. He correctly deduced that Iapetus is locked in synchronous rotation about Saturn and that one side of Iapetus is darker than the other, conclusions later confirmed by larger telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Lord Sainsbury of Turville, {{who then}} held 7.75% of Sainsbury's, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{no reason why}} the Sainsbury's board would even {{consider}} opening its books for due diligence for anything less than 600p per share. Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, with just under 3%, was more extreme than his cousin, and refused to sell at any price.|$|E
25|$|During his imprisonment, Albizu {{suffered}} deteriorating health. He {{alleged that}} he was the subject of human radiation experiments in prison and said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> colored rays bombarding him. When he wrapped wet towels around his head in order to shield himself from the radiation, the prison guards ridiculed him as El Rey de las Toallas (The King of the Towels).|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} an unfavorable {{report of the}} battle from Hohenzollern, Archduke Charles ordered him to retreat. This act conceded the victory to Davout, since this gave the French Marshal a clear line of communication with his Bavarian allies. At 10 pm on the 19th, Lefebvre sent the important information to Napoleon <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Davout's campfires near Teugn. To the Emperor, {{this meant that the}} III Corps had escaped entrapment. The Battle of Abensberg was fought the next day.|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 1883, Sir Laurence Oliphant {{wrote in}} the New York Sun that he had met with Mr. Sursock {{regarding}} {{the construction of a}} railway in the Jezreel Valley, and claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> surveying work as he wrote, from his home in Daliyat al-Karmel. Oliphant founded a company along with Gottlieb Schumacher, {{one of the founders of}} the German Colony of Haifa, and Georg Agger of Jaffa, which would find investors for attaining a construction permit from the Sursock family, and the construction itself.|$|E
500|$|In Justice Simpson's {{report to}} the Governor-General he wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> much to support {{the theory that the}} most likely cause was Spence's actions in the cockpit while he was {{adversely}} affected by insulin. [...] However, in his report he didn't determine that the accident had been caused by Spence's medical condition because there was insufficient evidence to completely prove the theory.|$|E
60|$|She made no answer. She {{moved her}} head very {{slightly}} so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face, and remained sitting rather stiffly and awkwardly {{with her eyes}} upon the fire.|$|R
60|$|Zeppa protested, rather anxiously, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> them, and no wonder, {{for just}} {{then his eyes}} were blinded by tears which no amount of wiping sufficed to clear away.|$|R
60|$|Lancelot argued: but in vain. The idea of disinterested {{sacrifice}} was {{so utterly}} {{foreign to the}} good man's own creed and practice, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> one pair of alternatives.|$|R
500|$|Hemingway {{was present}} at the Normandy Landings wearing a large head bandage but, {{according}} to Meyers, he was considered [...] "precious cargo" [...] and not allowed ashore. The landing craft came within sight of Omaha Beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back. Hemingway later wrote in Collier's <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [...] lay where they had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover." [...] Mellow explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the Dorothea Dix.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} {{speculation}} {{as to why}} Budington and the men aboard the Polaris did not attempt a rescue of those stranded on the ice floe. Tyson was perplexed {{as to why the}} ship could not see them [...] distant, a group of men and supplies waving a dark colored flag in a sea of white. The day after the storm was clear and calm, and the men on the floe could see the ship was under both steam and sail. Aboard the ship, first mate Chester reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "provisions and stores" [...] on a distant floe, however there were never any orders to retrieve the stores or search for the castaways.|$|E
500|$|In March 1972, the Nixon {{administration}} announced Admiral Noel Gayler as McCain's successor as CINCPAC, despite McCain's unheeded {{request to}} Nixon {{to have his}} tour extended so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the war to its conclusion. [...] McCain's time as CINCPAC ended on September 1, 1972; at the transfer of command ceremony in Honolulu that day, President Nixon focused on {{the contributions of the}} three generations of McCains – saying, [...] "In the story of the McCains we see the greatness of America" [...] – and awarded McCain a gold star in lieu of his second Navy Distinguished Service Medal. [...] For the next two months, McCain served as special assistant to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Chamberlain damaged his {{reputation}} in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated. In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> in hindsight how the interview {{could have been}} instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier {{was asked about the}} most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|Sepinwall noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "the obvious {{parallels}} to Michael's personal situation" [...] in this installment, while The A.V. Club editor Zack Handlen said that Awake [...] "continues to connect routine procedural storylines and {{find new ways}} to give them deeper meaning". Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about [...] "bringing two people who have drifted apart back together" [...] and that [...] "Nightswimming" [...] has [...] "balanced the series' larger mystery with grief and a twinge of optimism" [...] on a [...] "smaller scale" [...] compared to other entries of the program. He claimed that the installment was designed to [...] "introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special", adding that [...] "For most of the series, there hasn't been much chemistry between the two".|$|E
500|$|Otro Día Más Sin Verte (...) , {{also called}} Sentir in Spain, is the Spanish-language debut album by Cuban singer Jon Secada. It was {{released}} on October 6, 1992 by EMI Latin to coincide with his English-language self-titled debut album, which was released in April 1992. The idea to release an all Spanish-language album was pitched by Secada's music mentor Emilio Estefan, after realizing that SBK Records have yet released such an album. Estefan presented Secada's proposal for a Spanish-language recording {{to the head of}} Capitol EMI Records Charles Koppelman and then president of EMI Latin Jose Behar. Koppelman accepted the proposal after Behar stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> [...] "market potential" [...] for Secada. With the help of Emilio's wife, Gloria Estefan, Secada translated selected compositions from his English-language debut album for Otro Día Más Sin Verte.|$|E
60|$|He was thrilled, and {{he loved}} being thrilled. In two strides he reached his door. Unlike Slightly's door it filled the aperture, so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> beyond it, nor could the one {{knocking}} see him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{also thought}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was angry with Teeka, yet {{a vision of}} her many beauties persisted in {{haunting}} him, so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> her {{in the light of}} love as the most desirable thing in the world.|$|R
60|$|Then Caleb turned around, {{so as to}} {{have his}} face towards the light; and <b>he</b> found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> then <b>see</b> it {{reflected}} very distinctly. His grandmother went on with her work, and Caleb sat for some time in silence.|$|R
