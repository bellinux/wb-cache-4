In the first debate Kilroy and incumbent U.S. Representative, Pryce discussed the war in Iraq, the War on Terror, taxes, social security, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit</b> and President Bush. In the final week before the election, Pryce attempted to demand another debate.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit</b> and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} these {{provisions}} are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, {{such as new}} Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; {{there is also a}} tax penalty {{for those who do not}} obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit</b> by $143billion over the first decade.|$|E

25|$|Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, {{allowable}} deficit {{levels were}} calculated for the eventual elimination of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> If the budget exceeded the allowable deficit, across-the-board cuts were required. Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) were required {{to report to the}} Comptroller General regarding their recommendations for how much must be cut. The Comptroller General then evaluated these reports, made his own conclusion, and gave a recommendation to the President, who was then required to issue an order effecting the reductions required by the Comptroller General unless Congress made the required cuts by other ways within a specified amount of time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{proposed}} strategies for reducing <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> These may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. For example, a fast-growing economy offers the win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic pie, with higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. However, most other strategies represent a tradeoff scenario in which money or benefits are taken from some and given to others. Spending can be reduced from current levels, frozen, or the rate of future spending increases reduced. Budgetary rules can also be implemented to manage spending. Some changes can take place today, while others can phase in over time. Tax revenues can be raised in a variety of ways, by raising tax rates, the scope of what is taxed, or eliminating deductions and exemptions ("tax expenditures"). Regulatory uncertainty or barriers can be reduced, as these may cause businesses to postpone investment and hiring decisions.|$|E
25|$|Georgia's 6th Congressional {{district}} was redrawn in 2005, {{to include all}} of Cherokee County. That Fall, John Konop, a businessman from Cherokee, {{announced that he would}} challenge Price in the Republican primary. Konop ran to the right of Price on immigration policy and criticized Price's support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He also argued that Price's support for transportation and energy bills would increase <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> Price defended these bills, arguing that the former would return more tax-payer money to Georgia and that the latter could potentially help the United States achieve energy independence. Price raised $1.5 million throughout the primary campaign, while Konop merely raised around $50,000. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution endorsed Price in the primary election, suggesting that Price could {{play an important role in}} shaping future health care legislation. A televised debate between the candidates was held on July 7, 2006, and the election was then held on July 18. Price defeated Konop, 82%–18%.|$|E

25|$|During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney said {{he would}} seek income tax law reforms that he said would help lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. Among the series of tax changes he proposed were: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20 percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15 percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 percent to 25 percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and reining in tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, so that his tax plan would not raise federal deficits. Non-partisan analyses of Romney’s tax plan estimated that it could have added more than $3 trillion to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit,</b> and would have favored the highest-earning Americans, possibly raising annual taxes on middle-class earners by as much as $2,000. Romney and supporters of his tax plan said that such analyses were unreliable because they were based on assumptions about specific measures that were not detailed in the plan and because they had not adequately accounted for the positive effects on economic growth that Romney said his plan would generate. And that lower tax rates would lower rates of Tax evasion.|$|E
500|$|From 2017 onwards, {{states can}} apply for a [...] "waiver for state innovation" [...] {{that allows them to}} conduct {{experiments}} that meet certain criteria. To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as ACA, covers at least as many residents and does not increase <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> These states can be exempt from some of ACA's central requirements, including the individual and employer mandates and the provision of an insurance exchange.

500|$|With {{the support}} of the World Bank, the {{government}} tried new measures in 1987, including an increase in taxes, privatizations, and a decrease in government spending. Those measures could not be enforced; the government had lost the 1987 midterm elections, [...] "the15" [...] unions that had earlier supported the government distanced themselves from it, and the business community was unable to suggest a clear course of action. The PJ, aiming for a victory in the 1989 presidential elections, opposed the measures that it believed would have a negative social impact. The [...] "Spring plan" [...] sought to keep the economy stable until the elections by freezing prices and wages and reducing <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> This plan had an even worse reception than the Austral plan, and none of the parties supported it. The World Bank and the IMF refused to extend credits to Argentina. Big exporters refused to sell dollars to the Central Bank, which depleted its reserves. The austral was devaluated in February 1989, and the high inflation turned into hyperinflation. The 1989 presidential elections took place during this crisis, and the Justicialist Carlos Menem became the new president.|$|E
500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit,</b> and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>deficit.</b> In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E
