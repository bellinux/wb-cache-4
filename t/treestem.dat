A compreensão da variação da madeira nasdireções radial e {{longitudinal}} do tronco da árvorepode auxiliar pesquisadores das áreas de manejoflorestal e de tecnologia de madeira na obtenção deprodutos de melhor qualidade. Nesse sentido,foram coletadas amostras de árvores de Eucalypusdunnii aos sete anos de idade, das classessociológicas dominante, intermediária e dominada,com o objetivo de verificar as variações doselementos anatômicos entre as árvores. De cadaárvore foram retirados discos de madeira naposição base, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % e 100 % da alturacomercial. Em cada disco foram demarcadoscorpos-de-prova nas posições 0 %, 50 % e 100 % doraio. Os elementos anatômicos foram mensuradospor meio de análise de imagens. Os resultadospermitiram concluir que: a) das classes sociológicas,a intermediária apresentou fibras mais longas,maiores valores de diâmetro, lume tangencial dosvasos mais curtos e maiores valores em todas asdimensões dos raios; b) com relação à altura daárvore, os maiores valores de diâmetro tangencial,lume e parede das fibras, bem como de alturae largura dos raios foram encontrados na base,e c) na direção radial, todas as dimensões dasfibras, comprimento e diâmetro dos vasos, comotambém a altura e a largura dos raios, foramcrescente no sentido medula-casca.

The {{variation in}} the dimensions of theanatomical elements of the xylem has a remarkableeffect {{on the quality of}} wood and on the finalproduct. The comprehension of the wood variationalong the radial and longitudinal axis of the <b>treestem</b> can help forest management and woodtechnology researchers in getting better qualityproducts from planted forests. In order to gatherfurther information about this subject, woodsamples were collected of dominant, intermediateand dominated trees of Eucalyptus dunnii atthe age of seven years. The aim of this paper wasto analyze the dimensional variation of theanatomical elements in the pith-bark and bottomtopdirections. From each tree, wood disks weretaken from positions correspondent to bottom, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the commercial height. From each disk, samples were obtained fromthe positions 0 %, 50 % and 100 % of the radius. The anatomical elements were measured throughimage analysis. The results indicated that: a) of allsociological classes, the intermediary one showedthe highest values of fiber length, diameter, lumenand vessel length, vessel diameter, vessels frequencyand the highest value for all dimensions; b) concerningto height position in the tree, the highest values oflength, diameter of the fibers, frequency high andwidth of the rays, were found at 50 % of commercialheight, and c) all fiber dimensions, vessel diameterand length, as well as and height and width of raysincreased from pith to bark...|$|E
40|$|Cut-to-length (CTL) logging is a {{mechanized}} two-machine solution. The harvester processes <b>treestems</b> {{into smaller}} logs and a forwarder transports the logs from the logging site to a landing areaaccessible by trucks. The working machines for CTL logging are heavy and their suspension systemis generally rudimentary, basically the only damping {{is provided by}} the tires. To meet futuredemands on operator comfort, sustainable forestry, and climate concerns, significant challenges areto find means for reducing daily vibration dosage, soil damage, and rolling resistance. Paper A proposes a full-scale virtual model of a four-wheeled forwarder concept equipped with twopendulum axels with an actively controlled hydraulic suspension system mounted on each wheelaxle. The simulation results are then analyzed to determine the required actuation power. Paper B presents a performance comparison of a six-wheeled medium-sized pendulum-armsuspended forwarder, with three different suspension systems; active, semi-active, and passive. Amethodology to optimize and analyze forestry vehicle suspension performance based on multi-bodydynamic simulations are proposed and applied for the studied forwarder. Paper C is a model-based investigation of the dynamic behavior of a traditional eight-wheeledbogie type of forwarder with the main focus on identifying critical issues and suggesting criteria forassessing the performance of the machine while traveling on sloped and rough terrain. Paper D investigates the performance of a novel all-wheel-drive pendulum-arm suspendedmedium-sized forestry machine with passive and active chassis suspensions. The dynamicperformance of the pendulum-arm machine concept is quantified with simulations and comparedwith a “traditional” bogie-machine. Paper E investigates how to model a tracked forwarder and how the performance comparison canbe evaluated in multi-body simulation software like Adams ATV. Paper F presents a comparison of the dynamic behavior of forestry machines with different types ofpassive chassis suspensions from three perspectives: their gentleness to terrain, operator and theirpotential for improved fuel efficiency. Paper G proposes a 12 degrees-of-freedom multi-body dynamics simulation model of a standardeight-wheeled bogie type of medium-sized forwarder and verifies the simulation model withmeasured data from the field test that was carried out the actual machine. Paper H reconfigures the model presented in Paper G and compares a medium-sized forwarderequipped with two different track units with the performance of a wheeled and bogie-type offorwarder on hard rough ground, as well as on soft soil.
