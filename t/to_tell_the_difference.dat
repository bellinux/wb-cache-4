5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note {{that it is difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One {{solution}} to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
50|$|The sparrow {{has a long}} tail, gray-brown {{with white}} corners, and has dark marks {{on the back and}} sides.

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn up without a final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney would not be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{eruption}} style {{can take}} the form of either lava flows, spreading across the floor of the paterae, or lava lakes. Except for observations by Galileo during its seven close flybys, it can be difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a lava lake and a lava flow eruption on a patera floor, due to inadequate resolution and similar thermal emission characteristics. Intra-patera lava flow eruptions, such as the Gish Bar Patera eruption in 2001, can be just as voluminous as those seen spreading out across the Ionian plains. Flow-like features have also been observed within a number of paterae, like Camaxtli Patera, suggesting that lava flows periodically resurface their floors.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference,</b> as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E

40|$|Supernovae (SNe) {{that show}} {{evidence}} of strong shock interaction between their ejecta and pre-existing, slower circumstellar material (CSM) constitute an interesting, diverse, and still poorly understood category of explosive transients. The chief {{reason that they}} are extremely interesting is because they tell us that in a subset of stellar deaths, the progenitor star may become wildly unstable in the years, decades, or centuries before explosion. This {{is something that has}} not been included in standard stellar evolution models, but may significantly change the end product and yield of that evolution, and complicates our attempts to map SNe to their progenitors. Another reason they are interesting is because CSM interaction is an efficient engine for making bright transients, allowing super-luminous transients to arise from normal SN explosion energies, and allowing transients of normal SN luminosities to arise from sub-energetic explosions or low radioactivity yield. CSM interaction shrouds the fast ejecta in bright shock emission, obscuring our normal view of the underlying explosion, and the radiation hydrodynamics of the interaction is challenging to model. The CSM interaction may also be highly non-spherical, perhaps linked to binary interaction in the progenitor system. In some cases, these complications make it difficult <b>to</b> definitively <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a core-collapse or thermonuclear explosion, or to discern between a non-terminal eruption, failed SN, or weak SN.

25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that {{there are at least two}} distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E

5000|$|The first era of {{branding}} {{came to the}} {{new world}} in 1541 when Cortez imported Spanish cattle stamped with his trademark brand of 3 crosses, this solved the issue of knowing who's cow belonged to who. Branding is an extremely important communication platform in the marketing communication process. If a company brand isn't effectively communicated customers could easily become confused and possibly give their attention to another organization [...] Branding goes beyond having a logo, its how businesses communicate on behalf of their company, verbally and visually. A brand is a conversation, It is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room. Consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands. This can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships, personal selling and product packaging. Brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby the organization can try impressing its consumer. Without branding, consumers wouldn't be able to decipher between products and decide which one they like most. People may not be able <b>to</b> even <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between some of the brands, they would have to try each brand several times before being able to judge which one was best. In order to help with purchase decisions, marketing communications try to create a distinct image for the brand. Brand associations are made to encourage linkages with places, personalities or even emotions which creates a sophisticated brand personality {{in the minds of the}} consumers. This shows how brand communications add value to products and why branding is a crucial aspect to the communication platform.|$|R

30|$|There {{are other}} {{potentially}} IAW-related auroras {{which should be}} discussed in some detail. Semeter and Blixt (2006) and Semeter et al. (2008) showed that ‘arc packets’ can be interpreted by the parallel electric field of IAW within the resonance cone. The arc packets occur especially at intense aurora with intense geomagnetic activity. It is noteworthy that Alfven wave propagation on sharp density gradients in a direction transverse to the static magnetic field leads {{to the formation of}} a significant parallel electric field (Genot et al. 2004), which gives a spatiotemporal pattern similar to the arc packets. The relationship between arc packets and flickering has not been elucidated yet. It has been measured that field-aligned electron bursts (FABs) are superposed on mono-energetic inverted-V electrons (e.g., McFadden et al. 1987), especially {{at the edge of the}} inverted-V, and the whole characteristics is similar to those of flickering aurora. Dahlgren et al. (2013) recently showed that ‘flaming’ aurora during auroral breakup is consistent with the FABs and is also consistent with 2.4  Hz flickering. In event 1, it is still difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> phase <b>difference</b> of flickering rays with altitude, which might be like flaming or time-of-flight dispersion. It is therefore important to further investigate the occurrence distribution of flaming, flickering, arc packets, and their compound features to distinguish the exact mechanisms and to identify their meaning via high-speed imaging observations. Continuous ground-based high-speed imaging observation of aurora at > 100 fps is possible now (Kataoka et al. 2011 a, 2011 b; Yaegashi et al. 2011; Nishiyama et al. 2012, 2014). It would be important to pursue the meanings via the occurrence distribution of the fine-scale rapidly varying aurora against meso-scale and global-scale auroral dynamics.|$|R
