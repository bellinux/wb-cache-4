40|$|BackgroundThe {{effects of}} age, {{body mass index}} (BMI) and gender on motor vehicle crash (MVC) {{injuries}} are not well understood and current prevention efforts do not effectively address variability in occupant characteristics. Objectives 1) Characterize the effects of age, BMI and gender on serious-to-fatal MVC injury 2) Identify the crash modes and body regions where the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics onthe numbers <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> with injuryis largest, and thereby aid in prioritizing the need forhuman surrogates that the represent different types <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics and adaptive restraint systems that consider these characteristics. MethodsMultivariate logistic regression was used to model the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics (age, BMI, gender), vehicle and crash characteristics on serious-to-fatal injuries (AIS 3 +) by body region and crash mode using the 2000 - 2010 National Automotive Sampling System (NASS-CDS) dataset. Logistic regression models were applied to weighted crash data to estimate {{the change in the}} number <b>of</b> annual injured <b>occupants</b> with AIS 3 + injury that would occur if occupant characteristics were limited to their 5 th percentiles (age 22 ̆ 0304 17 years old, BMI 22 ̆ 0304 19 kg/m 2) or male gender.

50|$|Whenever {{the studies}} {{referenced}} tried {{to discuss the}} thermal conditions for different groups <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in one room, the studies ended up simply presenting comparisons of thermal comfort satisfaction based on the subjective studies. No study tried to reconcile the different thermal comfort requirements of different types <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> who compulsorily must stay in one room. Therefore, it looks to be necessary to investigate the different thermal conditions required by different groups <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in hospitals to reconcile their different requirements in this concept. To reconcile {{the differences in the}} required thermal comfort conditions it is recommended to test the possibility of using different ranges of local radiant temperature in one room via a suitable mechanical system.|$|R
40|$|Applying {{agent-based}} modeling {{to simulate}} the evacuation in case of emergency situations is recognized by many research works as an efficient tool for understanding the behavior and decision making <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in these situations. In this paper, we present our work aiming to modeling {{the influence of the}} emotion and social relationship <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> on their behaviors and decision making in emergency as in case of fire disaster. Firstly, we proposed a formalization of occupants' behavior at group level in emergency situations based on the social theory. This formalization details possible behaviors and actions of people in emergency evacuations, taking into account occupant's social relationship. The formalization will facilitate the construction of simulation for emergency evacuation. Secondly, we modeled the influence of emotion and group behavior on the decision making <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in crisis situations. Thirdly, we developed an agent-based simulation that took into account the effect of group and emotion on the decision making <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in emergency situations.

It examines data collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology taken from eight different stairwells during unannounced fire drills in four buildings. Based on the raw data given by NIST the velocity, density, and specific flow were calculated for each occupant on every floor in which data was collected. Though data was noisy, results demonstrate {{that there is a}} linear trend between density <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in a stairwell and the velocity they descend at. There is also a parabolic trend between density and specific flow rate <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> on stairs. While no direct correlation was found, stairwell width does seem to influence the speed and specific flow <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> since the stairwell with the smallest effective width found occupants traveling slower. As well, the correlations in the SFPE Handbook, developed by Nelson and Mowrer concerning velocity and specific flow rate, were found to be an upper limit on the data that was analyzed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the reason}} that the number <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in {{high-rise}} building is usually very large, the evacuation process of the building would cost a lengthy time, which threats the life safety <b>of</b> the <b>occupants</b> under the circumstance of serious disaster such as fire. Thus to ensure the safety <b>of</b> <b>occupants,</b> different evacuation strategies have been proposed. One of the recently proposed strategies is that fire elevators should be used to aid evacuation so that the congestion level in the stairwell would be reduced. To explore the efficiency of elevator aided evacuation process, a network model for building evacuation is established in the present paper. Factors including the building plan component, the number <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> and the configuration of the elevator status which affect the evacuation efficiency have been numerically investigated. A first principle for elevator aided evacuation has been summarized. Results also indicate that there is a top limit of the optimization process of the elevator aided evacuation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{evaluation}} of the failure probability and safety level <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> evacuation is <b>of</b> extreme importance. The safety level <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> evacuation is expressed by the margin of escape time. Three traditional methods for solving the reliability index are introduced and an optimization method is proposed in this study. Comparisons between the optimization method and the traditional methods are carried out. Since occupant evacuation is affected by various random parameters, {{it is necessary to}} analyze the importance of each variable in comparison with the others in occupant safety evacuation. A methodology is presented to classify the significant and insignificant random variables using sensitivity analysis. Finally, the successful application in a case study suggests that these methodologies are suitable and reliable for the reliability analysis <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> safety evacuation in public assembly occupancies...|$|R

40|$|Occupants are a {{critical}} impact factor of building energy consumption. Numerous previous studies emphasized the role <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> and investigated {{the interactions between}} occupants and buildings. However, a fundamental problem, how to learn occupancy patterns and predict occupancy schedule, has not been well addressed due to highly stochastic activities <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> and insufficient data. This study proposes a data mining based approach for occupancy schedule learning and prediction in office buildings. The proposed approach first recognizes the patterns <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> presence by cluster analysis, then learns the schedule rules by decision tree, and finally predicts the occupancy schedules based on the inducted rules. A case {{study was conducted in}} an office building in Philadelphia, U. S. Based on one-year observed data, the validation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of occupancy schedule prediction. The proposed approach only requires simple input data (i. e., the time series data <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> number entering and exiting a building), which is available in most office buildings. Therefore, this approach is practical to facilitate occupancy schedule prediction, building energy simulation and facility operation. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|In [3], a low-resolution range sensor was {{investigated}} for an occupant classification system that distinguish per-son from child seats or an empty seat. The optimal deploy-ment of vehicle airbags for maximum protection moreover requires {{information about the}} occupant’s size and position. The detection <b>of</b> <b>occupant’s</b> position involves the detection and localization <b>of</b> <b>occupant’s</b> head. This is a challenging problem as the approaches based on local shape analysis (in 2 D or 3 D) alone are not robust enough as {{other parts of the}} person’s body like shoulders, knee may have similar shapes as the head. This paper discusses and investigate the potential of a Reeb graph approach to describe the topology <b>of</b> vehicle <b>occupants</b> in terms <b>of</b> a skeleton. The essence of the proposed approach is that an occupant sitting in a vehi-cle has a typical topology which leads to different branches of a Reeb Graph and the possible location <b>of</b> the <b>occupant’s</b> head are thus the end points of the Reeb graph. The pro-posed method is applied on real 3 D range images and is compared to Ground truth information.
