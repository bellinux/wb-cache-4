5000|$|Since a cost <b>estimate</b> is <b>the</b> {{approximation}} {{of the cost}} of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> accuracy. Predictions of <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> accuracy may accompany <b>the</b> <b>estimate.</b> Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with <b>the</b> point <b>estimate</b> with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive estimate might be that <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early <b>estimate</b> relates to <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> quality. Factors affecting the quality of <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> include <b>the</b> people who prepared <b>the</b> <b>estimate,</b> how <b>the</b> <b>estimate</b> was prepared, and what was known about the project. For the same project, the range of uncertainty about <b>the</b> total <b>estimate</b> decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>estimated</b> {{probability}} of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit.

Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times <b>the</b> <b>estimated</b> energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E
