5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{were under}} <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were facing three Belgian {{divisions}} with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions {{to negotiate a}} surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them {{a short distance away}} from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the regular}} front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to {{increase}} their patrol activities upon the Saïo Plateau to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces. They used shoot-and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire and leaving the Italians with <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were facing multiple consistent points of fire. In response, the General Gazzera tripled {{the size of the}} Mogi garrison. The Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Saïo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and were heading southeast to cut the Saïo-Yubdo road. By {{the end of the month}} the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo and make a final stand at Saïo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF further complicated their situation.|$|E

50|$|There was {{confusion}} {{between the}} ground convoy and the assault team. The assault {{team and the}} ground convoy waited for 20 minutes to receive their orders to move out.

5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated {{to be held in}} March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} with {{the handling of}} evidence, with Australian police presenting their own notes to Haneef under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were diary entries written by Haneef. This led to inaccurate claims {{that the police had}} written in the diary itself but it has been confirmed that the police notes were not written in Haneef's diary.|$|E
25|$|Pidgin Delaware {{was used}} by both Munsee and Unami Delawares in {{interactions}} with speakers of Dutch, Swedish, and English. Some non-Delaware users of the pidgin were under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were speaking true Delaware. Material cited by William Penn as being from a Delaware language is in fact from Delaware Pidgin, and he was apparently unaware {{of the difference between}} real Delaware and Pidgin Delaware.|$|E

In the wake of this, ICSTIS launched an inquiry which could have resulted in Channel 4 refunding an estimated £3 million to people who took part with phone or text votes. Despite ICSTIS ruling that Big Brother breached its guidelines and misled phone voters, Channel 4 was not made to refund viewers and was instead fined and forced to pay almost £50,000 in administrative costs.|$|E
25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply heaviness and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above. Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are further into the house than they actually are.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his high}} profile, Furtwängler's public {{opposition}} prompted a mixed reaction from the Nazi leadership. Heinrich Himmler wished to send Furtwängler to a concentration camp. Goebbels and Göring ordered their administration to listen to Furtwängler's requests and to give him <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would do what he asked. This led him {{to believe that he}} had some positive influence to stop the racial policy. He subsequently invited several Jewish and anti-fascist artists (such as Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Schnabel, and Pablo Casals) to perform as soloists in his 1933/34 season, but they refused to come to Nazi Germany. Furtwängler subsequently invited Jewish musicians from his orchestra such as Szymon Goldberg to play as soloists.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface of}} the rug is {{arranged}} and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field ("all-over design"). When {{the end of the}} field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is prohibited even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the Quran by Uthman Ibn Affan in 651 AD/19 AH and the Umayyad Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reforms, Islamic art has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called infinite repeat.|$|E
25|$|Because of poor planning, {{the coup}} leaders {{had failed to}} provide {{provisions}} for the troops on Lapangan Merdeka, who were becoming hot and thirsty. They were under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were guarding {{the president in the}} palace. Over the course of the afternoon, Suharto persuaded both battalions to give up without a fight, first the Brawijaya battalion, who came to Kostrad HQ, then the Diponegoro troops, which withdrew to Halim. His troops gave Untung's forces inside the radio station an ultimatum and they also withdrew. By 7pm Suharto was in control of all the installations previously held by 30 September Movement's forces. Now joined by Nasution, at 9pm he announced over the radio that he was now in command of the Army and that he would destroy the counter-revolutionary forces and save Sukarno. He then issued another ultimatum, this time to the troops at Halim. Later that evening, Sukarno left Halim and arrived in Bogor, where there was another presidential palace.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrorist}}s {{were from the}} Islamic terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, and were believed to have entered India through Nepal. They posed as pilgrims {{on their way to}} Ayodhya, and boarded a Tata Sumo at Akbarpur near the Kichaucha village in Faizabad. At Faizabad they abandoned the Sumo and hired a jeep driven by a driver, Rehan Alam Amsari. According to a statement by the driver, the terrorists visited the Ram (Temple) at Ayodhya where they prayed, possibly to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were indeed pilgrims. The terrorists then drove the jeep into the Ram Janmabhoomi site, and forced the driver out of the vehicle, banging the jeep against the security cordon. At 9:05am, they hurled M67 grenades from 50 metres away to breach the cordon fence. Ramesh Pandey, a pilgrim guide who happened to be near the site at this moment, died on the spot {{as a result of the}} grenade blast. Firing indiscriminately, the 5 terrorists entered the Mata Sita Rasoi. Returning the gunfire, a platoon of 35 CRPF soldiers killed all five of the terrorists in a gunfight that lasted for over an hour. Three CRPF soldiers also received serious injuries and, as of July 2008, two remain comatose. All the terrorists died within 100 meters of the site.|$|E

The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a {{separate}} vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares had <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find {{a lot of people in}} the houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E

This hiding place became known as the Achterhuis (translated as [...] "Secret Annex" [...] in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland.

The door to the Achterhuis was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a {{directive}} calling on the umpires to [...] "get tough" [...] in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to [...] "back the umpires to the fullest extent".

The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> considered him an illegitimate bowler. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964.
