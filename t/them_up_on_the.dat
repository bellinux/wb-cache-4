5|$|On {{the same}} night the New York Mets were coming from behind to defeat the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, the Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 27–20 in week eight to improve to 6–2 and move into a tie with the Redskins for the division lead. With the teams tied 20–20, Joe Morris scored the game-winning touchdown on a 13-yard run with 98 seconds remaining. The Giants offense featured a two tight end formation {{throughout much of the}} game which allowed them to run the ball more effectively. The Giants used Mark Bavaro and Zeke Mowatt throughout much of the game, sometimes even lining <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side. Morris finished the game with 181yards. Redskins quarterback Jay Schroeder threw for 420yards in the loss.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} the German {{attempts}} at eradicating the ghetto completely following the uprising, hundreds of Polish Jews remained in hiding when the Auschwitz deportations ended in August 1943. The survivors were smuggled out of the bunkers in small groups by ŻOB members: Fela Kac, Schmuel Ron and Kasia Szancer. Polish rescuers who picked <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'Aryan' {{side of the city}} included Roman Kołodziej, killed for saving Jews on 2 January 1944, and Zofia Klemens arrested by Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp; Klemens survived. She was awarded the title of the Righteous in 1964. The Jews were taken over by the family of Piotr and Karolina Kobylec with their actively helping sons Mieczysław, Alojzy and Wiktor who used to secure food for them, and daughter Klara Banasik, living in nearby Dąbrówka Mała with small children. In total, the Kobylec family rescued over seventy (70) Jews; and received Righteous medals twenty years later.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reception}} for MUSHA was mixed. Critics found themselves {{overwhelmed by the}} sheer amount of shoot <b>'em</b> <b>ups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sega Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable. Journalists generally agreed the game had great graphics and enjoyable gameplay, but felt it was unoriginal and not very challenging. In retrospect, MUSHA has garnered much higher praise, being cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics considered ahead of its time. It remains among the most highly regarded shoot <b>'em</b> <b>ups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Genesis and is considered among {{the best of the}} 16-bit era. Original MUSHA cartridges have become rare and command high prices in the collector market, however, the game was re-released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the west in 2009.|$|R

In February, the German withdrawal was discovered and the Allies, finding an open battlefield {{for the first time since}} 1914 and believing that the German Army was suffering from limited manpower, began an advance to follow <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night of 26/27 February, the 7th Battalion launched what was meant to be a trench raid, but turned into an open advance, seeing them extend their lines by [...] The Allied advance, however, was brief as the Germans had established themselves in strength, and was halted at Bullecourt.|$|E

500|$|A small {{force of}} thirty-eight menseven {{officers}} and thirty-one other rankswas {{selected from the}} battalion and designated X Troop, commanded by Major T.A.G. Pritchard of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Three Italian-speaking interpreters were attached to the troop {{for the duration of}} the operation: Squadron Leader Lucky MC, Rifleman Nasri from the Rifle Brigade and a civilian named Fortunato Picchi, a waiter in the Savoy Hotel. Training for the operation began in January 1941 and lasted for six weeks, in order to allow time for six Whitley bombers to be converted to drop parachutists. A full-scale model of the aqueduct was built in early February to allow the troop to practice its assault, and during training one enlisted man was killed when he parachuted into an ice-covered pond and drowned before he could be rescued. The plan for the operation called for six Whitleys of No. 51 Squadron RAF to transport X Troop from Malta to the target area on 10 February, while another two bombers would carry out a diversionary raid against railway yards at Foggia, approximately [...] to the north of the aqueduct. At 21:30 the troop would be dropped around the objective, attack and demolish it, and then withdraw [...] to the coast to the mouth of the Sele River, where the submarine HMS Triumph would pick <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of 15 February.|$|E

In the 18th Division area the 54th Brigade attacked with an extra company, to capture dugouts up to Boom Ravine and consolidate the first objective, while the 53rd Brigade formed a defensive flank on the left. Artillery support came from the divisional artillery, army field brigades and the neighbouring Australian corps. The creeping and standing barrages began at [...] and the infantry advanced against a sparse German artillery reply. The German infantry proved alert and inflicted many casualties with small-arms fire, which with the darkness, fog and a sea of mud slowed the advance and caused units to become disorganised. The 99th Brigade reached the first objective and established a defensive flank against German counter-attacks but the 54th Brigade found uncut wire at Grandcourt Trench and lost the barrage while looking for gaps. The German garrison was able to emerge from cover and engage the British infantry, holding <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. The left-hand battalion found more gaps but had so many casualties that it was also held up. On the 53rd Brigade front, Grandcourt Trench was captured quickly but the advance was held up at Coffee Trench by more uncut wire.|$|E
