5000|$|Proposition 2 was a {{referendum}} {{for a state}} constitutional amendment placed on the ballot by the Texas legislature {{and approved by the}} voters at the November 8, 2005 general election. The measure added a new provision to the Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 32, which provides that [...] "Marriage in <b>this</b> state <b>shall</b> <b>consist</b> only <b>of</b> the union of one man and one woman", and [...] "This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage."

5000|$|The seal of Texas {{has changed}} 5 times since {{independence}} from Mexico in 1836. The original Great Seal of the Republic was created on December 10, 1836, by the Congress, {{with a bill}} providing that [...] "for the future the national seal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> republic <b>shall</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> a single star, with the letters 'Republic of Texas', circular on said seal, which seal shall also be circular". After initial hopes for the quick annexation of Texas into the United States grew dim, the Third Congress modified the seal and created a national arms in 1839. The bill stated, [...] "The national arms of the Republic of Texas be, {{and the same is}} hereby declared to be a white star of five points, on an azure ground, encircled by an olive and live oak branches", as well as that [...] "The national great seal of <b>this</b> Republic <b>shall,</b> from and after the passage of this act, bear the arms of this nation..., and the letters 'Republic of Texas'". When Texas joined the Union in 1845, the new state constitution retained the seal, changing only the word [...] "Republic" [...] to [...] "State", and removed the background from the arms. It was not until 1992 that the seal and arms were standardized.|$|R
40|$|Smart {{technologies}} for cities require {{a fundamental shift}} in business model paradigms. Smart city solutions aim to link multiple technologies and multiple public and private stakeholders by an ICT-based connector. Digitalization and the Internet of Things (loT) practices require a new organizational and economic model for connected clean and efficient technologies. Companies and cities thus need to start thinking beyond efficiency and policy based models and understand themselves {{as part of a}} larger value model that delivers value-added services to cities and citizens. The smart city value model is thus a new economic approach to link the value creation of integrated socio-technical systems to a set of different beneficiaries and types of benefits, which builds on the conceptual work of positive externalities and external benefits. It is intrinsically linked to smart cities and districts places where the positive effects of a connected solution reach many different beneficiaries and are able to create different kinds of value through the interaction of many systems and people. The lighthouse project Triangulum thus serves as a test case to develop a modular framework that helps to systematise the factors that lead to a successful design and implementation of smart districts and prove the distributed benefits of smart and sustainable technologies in cities. <b>This</b> framework <b>shall</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> a range of “smart city modules” that can be described as system solutions for smart cities. They represent core technologies that are organised around a business model and pursue a specific goal for cities and citizens. A set of smart city indicators will help distinguish between individual local factors and generic smart city success factors. Connected solutions can be broken down into some core categories leading to a finite number of connected solutions with specific characteristics...|$|R
