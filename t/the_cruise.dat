40|$|Energy-efficient air {{conditioning}} of passenger cells is an ever-increasing {{challenge in the}} development of electric vehicles because the electric heating in particular reduces <b>the</b> <b>cruising</b> range significantly. For this reason, a simula-tion model has been developed at Chemnitz University of Technology, which simulates the whole {{air conditioning}} system including the passenger cell and the complete powertrain in electric cars. With the help of this model, differ-rent optimization approaches on <b>the</b> <b>cruising</b> range have been analyzed and evaluated. This paper first illustrates how much <b>the</b> <b>cruising</b> range of an exemplary electric vehicle is reduced by using the electric heating under different wintery weather conditions. Afterwards, the exploitation of the waste heat produced by the powertrain components (electric motor and power electronics) will be explained. Finally, it shall be described to what extent this exploitation increases <b>the</b> <b>cruising</b> range...|$|R

5|$|Laforey's {{success was}} {{considered}} impressive by historian William James, as his ship carried only 28 nine-pounder cannon {{in contrast with}} L'Huillier's 32 twelve-pounder guns and four 24-pounder carronades. Castor was also a larger ship with a slightly larger crew, and although L'Huillier and his men had only been aboard for ten days, the crew of Carysfort had only come together immediately before <b>the</b> <b>cruise</b> and had not had much longer to become acquainted with their vessel than the French crew.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Longer <b>Cruising</b> Week is a {{succession}} to the one-off Skandia Round Britain Voyage {{and the general}} feedback from the four-day trips being that the young people wanted a longer time together.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cruise</b> port of Puerto Costa Maya was {{severely}} damaged, causing Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's two largest cruise operators, to divert {{away from the}} port until at least 2009.

5|$|The voyage {{taught the}} Navy more fueling {{stations}} were needed around the world, and the strategic {{potential of the}} Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914.

5|$|Wisconsin {{spent nearly}} all of 1947 as a {{training}} ship, taking naval reservists on two-week cruises throughout the year.

5|$|All six {{ships of}} the class served with the Atlantic Fleet for the {{duration}} of their careers. The first five ships took part in <b>the</b> <b>cruise</b> of the Great White Fleet in 190709.

The ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean. They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic, arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. New Hampshire, which had not been completed in time {{to take part in the}} journey, met the fleet there during a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
