He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> message of this song, at least for me personally when I was writing the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E

2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about what happens on those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E
60|$|But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{mistake of}} Mr. Wells's {{philosophy}} is a somewhat deeper one, {{one that he}} expresses in a very entertaining manner in {{the introductory part of}} the new Utopia. His philosophy in some sense amounts to a denial of the possibility of philosophy itself. At least, he maintains that there are no secure and reliable ideas upon which we can rest with a final mental satisfaction. It will be both clearer, however, and more amusing to quote Mr. Wells himself.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{extremely}} probable that this manuscript, of which Arias Perez gives so vague an account from recollection, but which {{he appears to}} <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> thing that prompted Columbus to his undertaking, was no other than the work of Marco Polo, which, at that time, existed in manuscript {{in most of the}} Italian libraries. Martin Alonzo was evidently acquainted with the work of the Venetian, and it would appear, from various circumstances, that Columbus had a copy of it with him in his voyages, which may have been the manuscript above mentioned. Columbus had long before, however, had a knowledge of the work, if not by actual inspection, at least through his correspondence with Toscanelli in 1474, and had derived from it all the light it was capable of furnishing, before he ever came to Palos. It is questionable, also, whether the visit of Martin Alonzo to Rome, was not after his mind had been heated by conversations with Columbus in the convent of La Rabida. The testimony of Arias Perez is so worded as to leave it in doubt whether the visit was not in the very year prior to the discovery: [...] "fue el dicho su padre á Roma aquel dicho año antes que fuese a descubrir." [...] Arias Perez always mentions the manuscript as having been imparted to Columbus, after he had come to Palos with an intention of proceeding on the discovery.|$|E
50|$|Jiang <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{cause of}} {{desertification}} in Inner Mongolia is overgrazing. By 2000 some 80% of the grasslands in Hunshandake had deteriorated into desert, and 33% {{of the land}} had become mobile sand dunes. In the 1960s mobile sand dunes only made up 2% of the land.sina The first attempt to solve desertification involved planting 100,000 yuan (13,000 U.S. dollars) worth of willows, because conventional thought led Jiang to believe trees were the best solution to stop sandstorms.|$|R

60|$|Before {{starting}} to America I had completed Orley Farm, a novel {{which appeared in}} shilling numbers,--after {{the manner in which}} Pickwick, Nicholas Nickleby, and many others had been published. Most of those among my friends who talk to me now about my novels, and are competent to form an opinion on the subject, say that this is the best I have written. In this opinion I do not coincide. I think that the highest merit which a novel can have consists in perfect delineation of character, rather than in plot, or humour, or pathos, and I shall before long mention a subsequent work in which I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> character of the story is so well developed as to justify me in asserting its claim above the others. The plot of Orley Farm is probably the best I have ever made; but it has the fault of declaring itself, and thus coming to an end too early in the book. When Lady Mason tells her ancient lover that she did forge the will, the plot of Orley Farm has unravelled itself;--and this she does {{in the middle of the}} tale. Independently, however, of this the novel is good. Sir Peregrine Orme, his grandson, Madeline Stavely, Mr. Furnival, Mr. Chaffanbrass, and the commercial gentlemen, are all good. The hunting is good. The lawyer's talk is good. Mr. Moulder carves his turkey admirably, and Mr. Kantwise sells his tables and chairs with spirit. I do not know that there is a dull page in the book. I am fond of Orley Farm;--and am especially fond of its illustrations by Millais, which are the best I have seen in any novel in any language.|$|E
