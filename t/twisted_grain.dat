50|$|Northern rātā is {{a massive}} tree, easily {{distinguished}} from other Metrosideros species by its small, leathery, dark green leaves which are 25-50mm long by 15-25mm wide, and have a distinct notch at the tip. Young growth is generally pink and covered in fine rust-coloured hairs that are gradually shed as the foliage ages but tends to persist at the midrib and {{in the vicinity of}} the leaf base. The flowers, borne in sprays on the tips of branches, are a mass of dark scarlet stamens. Flowering peaks between November and January, and seeds take a year or slightly more to ripen. The bark is usually brown or grey-brown and rather corky and provides an ideal stratum for the roots of epiphytic plants such as Astelia species and Freycinetia banksii (kiekie).

50|$|Log {{splitting}} is {{the act of}} splitting firewood from logs {{that have}} been pre-cut into sections (rounds, bolts, billets). This {{can be done by}} hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical log splitter. When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or <b>twisted</b> <b>grain</b> can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.|$|E

In the UTGBC* phase, the smectic C* (SmC*) -like blocks and the grain boundaries separating them undulate to form a two-dimensional square lattice perpendicular to the TGB helix axis. We treat the grain boundaries separating adjacent smectic blocks as interfaces with an anisotropic interfacial tension. At moderate chiral strengths we find a TGBA-TGBC-SmC* sequence.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{competition}} of graphene electronics demands an efficient route which produces high quality and large area graphene. Chemical vapour deposition technique, where hydrocarbons dissociate in to active carbon species and form graphene layer on the desired metal catalyst via nucleation is considered {{as the most}} suitable method. In this study, single layer graphene {{with the presence of}} few layer single crystal graphene grains were grown on Pt foil via chemical vapour deposition. The higher growth temperature changes the surface morphology of the Pt foil so a delicate process of hydrogen bubbling was used to peel off graphene from Pt foil samples with the mechanical support of photoresist and further transferred to SiO 2 /Si substrates for analysis. Optical microscopy of the graphene transferred samples showed the regions of single layer along with different oriented graphene domains. Two type of interlayer stacking sequences, Bernal and twisted, were observed in the graphene grains. The presence of different stacking sequences in the graphene layers influence the electronic and optical properties; in Bernal stacking the band gap can be tunable and in twisted stacking the overall sheet resistance can be reduced. Grain boundaries of Pt provides low energy sites to the carbon species, therefore the nucleation of grains are more at the boundaries. The stacking order and the number of layers in grains were seen more clearly with scanning electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy showed high quality graphene samples due to very small D peak. 2 D Raman peak for single layer graphene showed full width half maximum (FWHM) value of 30 cm− 1. At points A, B and C, Bernal stacked grain showed FWHM values of 51. 22, 58. 45 and 64. 72 cm− 1, while twisted stacked grain showed the FWHM values of 27. 26, 28. 83 and 20. 99 cm− 1, respectively. FWHM values of 2 D peak of Bernal stacked grain showed an increase of 20 – 30 cm− 1 as compare to single layer graphene which showed its dispersive nature and confirmed Bernal sequence. On the other hand, the slightest decrease in FWHM values of 2 D peak in <b>twisted</b> <b>grain</b> comparing to single layer confirmed the twisted sequence of grains.
