Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division {{to fight in the}} European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. [...] "I wasn't in any heavy fighting," [...] he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army. Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team. [...] "Marshall hadn't started back up, and I hadn't played football for two years," [...] he later explained. [...] "I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> do nothing, so I went to Auburn." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roberts once stated: [...] "You're {{going to}} be {{unemployed}} if {{you really think you}} just have <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> wait for the muse to land on your shoulder." [...] She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes {{back to the beginning of}} the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the [...] "texture and color" [...] of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.|$|E

60|$|SUNDAY.--It is {{up there}} yet. Resting, apparently. But that is a subterfuge: Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is {{appointed}} for that. It {{looks to me like}} a creature that is more interested in resting than in anything else. It would tire me to rest so much. It tires me just <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> watch the tree. I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything.|$|E

60|$|That {{afternoon}} {{there was}} a large meeting of the heads of families in front of what was known as the big hut. There was no formality about the meeting. Unlike the war councils of the Indians, it was a sort of free-and-easy, in which blubber and other choice kinds of food did duty for the red man's pipe.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sadler, [...] "it is a {{camp with}} {{a good deal of}} comfort in it. Our Number One camps are pretty rough. They are for hunters and {{scientific}} people. We give them game enough in season, and some bare places where they can make fires and stretch a bit of canvas. That is all they want, to have a truly good time. That is the best camp of all, I think. Number Two camps are generally for fishermen. They always want a chance for pretty good living when they are out in the woods. They stay in camp in the evenings, and like <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> have a good time. Number Threes are the best camps we put families into, so you see, madam, I'm rating you pretty high. There's always a log-cabin in these camps, with cots and straw mattresses and plenty of traps for cooking. And, more than that, there is a chance for people who don't tramp or fish to do things, such as walking or boating, according to circumstances. There's one of our camps has a croquet-ground." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 10, 2004 Lindner {{complained that}} critics of his remarks were not {{focusing}} on the real motives of his bill and his speech. He said [...] "that homosexuality, the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, and comprehensive sexual health education could prompt a future 'holocaust' in Minnesota". On the House floor he said, [...] "hat I am trying to prevent is the holocaust of our children getting STDs, AIDS, and various other diseases {{that are going to}} affect their lives. If you want <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> here <b>and</b> wait until America becomes another African continent, well, then, you do that, but I'm {{going to do something about}} it."

[...] "This is nice", commented Reiser on the Stephanie Miller radio program, [...] "because you get <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> root for other shows to fail."

2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around.</b> You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time <b>to</b> actually <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference. Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the [...] "Golden Man"/Dragon.|$|R

50|$|The {{technical}} {{advances of}} the 1920s were instead largely in radio technology. The key development {{there was the}} introduction of amplification, {{so that it was}} possible <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the radio <b>and</b> listen as a family, unlike the earlier crystal sets which required the use of headphones. Amplification was also applied to the recording of 78 rpm records, the electrical recording systems introduced around 1925 allowing a major rise in sound quality. Radio and these new records rapidly eroded the market for the player piano, and it was declining from the mid-1920s onwards. Novel attempts to combine the appeal of the player piano and its new rivals were made by building radios and/or phonographs into player pianos themselves, but even this could not entice the public to continue buying player pianos.|$|R

5000|$|Barnes {{started a}} course at Ealing Art College {{at the same}} time as Townshend and the two of them shared a flat together, bonding over their mutual love for old R&B and soul records. Townshend {{subsequently}} said that Barnes was [...] "very important to The Who's thinking process in the early days. He and I used <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> talk about The Who as an installation, we wrote a manifesto for the group together." [...] When Townshend's group, The Detours, needed a new name, the pair sat up all night suggesting joke names, until Barnes came up with The Who.

[...] Bucciarelli adds: [...] "We wrote more songs for this album than ever before. We wrote over 30, then whittled them down to the absolute best ones. We took parts from some and added them to others and made a Frankenstein out of them. We were always writing, re-writing, arranging and re-arranging.

Politicans and government critics love <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> the table <b>and</b> talk about bureaucrats, the Guinevere's of the American Camelot. There's only two problems. First, Guinevere isn't to blame. The fault maybe with the knights who seem not to understand bureaucracy and who have provided {{little in the way of}} leadership for revisioning bureaucracy. Second, the knights are long on stories but short on practical and conceptual strategies for revitalizing Camelot. In fact, most don't have a clue of what bureaucracy is.

6000|$|In {{the heart}} of Buffalo there stands a {{magnificent}} building which the population do innocently style a music-hall. Everybody comes here of evenings <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> little tables <b>and</b> listen to a first-class orchestra. The place is something like the Gaiety Theatre at Simla, enlarged twenty times.

Here I went with a friend--poor or boor is the man who cannot pick up a friend for a season in America--and here was shown the really smart folk of the city. I grieve to say I laughed, because when an American wishes to be correct he sets himself to imitate the Englishman. This he does vilely, and earns not only the contempt of his brethren, but the amused scorn of the Briton.|$|R
5000|$|The {{songs were}} drawn from two {{distinct}} periods. The earlier guitar driven compositions were written during {{the latter half of}} 1979: [...] "Atrocity Exhibition", [...] "Passover", [...] "Colony", [...] "A Means To An End" [...] and [...] "24 Hours". All were played live in that year and some were recorded for various radio sessions. The other songs were written in early 1980 and made more prominent use of synthesisers: [...] "Isolation", [...] "Heart and Soul", [...] "The Eternal" [...] and [...] "Decades". Most songs were written by jamming in their practice room. Regarding the album's lyrical content, Bernard Sumner remarked, [...] "We'd go <b>to</b> rehearsals <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> talk about really banal things. We'd do that until we couldn't talk about banal things any more, then we'd pick up our instruments and record into a little cassette player. We didn't talk about the music or the lyrics very much. We never analysed it." ...|$|R
