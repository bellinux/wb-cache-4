5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants {{was in fact a}} mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> elaborate production {{of his first}} solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods {{for the next several}} years.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} part of a {{movement}} by Gregory to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the same vein, and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.|$|E

5|$|It {{was one of}} Warren's ships, the frigate HMS Arethusa, {{which first}} {{discovered}} the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on Arethusa miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships {{of the line and}} ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French. Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having only taken enough aboard for 15 days at sea in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier. On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet {{in the face of the}} supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.|$|E

25|$|Liberal {{branches}} of Judaism make some additional {{changes to the}} opening benedictions. the phrase umeivi go'eil ("and brings a redeemer") is changed in Reform Judaism to umeivi ge'ulah ("who brings redemption"), replacing the personal messiah with a Messianic Age. The phrase m'chayei hameitim ("who causes the dead to come to life") is replaced in the Reform and Reconstructionist siddurim with m'chayei hakol ("who gives life to all") and m'chayei kol chai ("who gives life to all life"), respectively. This represents a <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional article of faith that God will resurrect the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion in Barnette {{is considered one}} of the Court's greatest and most sweeping statements about the fundamental freedoms established by the Bill of Rights. After Barnette the Court began to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> belief-action doctrine altogether, creating a religious exemption for believers of different creeds. In Sherbert v. Verner (1963), for example, the Court upheld a Seventh-day Adventist's claim to unemployment benefits even though she declined to make herself available to work on Saturday (her Sabbath) as the law required. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), the Court upheld the right of Amish parents not to send their children to public schools past the eighth grade.|$|E
25|$|The risk would {{probably}} be reduced by improved coaching techniques, such as teaching young batters to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball to avoid errant pitches, according to doctors. Defensive players in lacrosse and hockey are now taught to avoid using their chest to block the ball or puck. Chest protectors and vests are designed to reduce trauma from blunt bodily injury, {{but this does not}} offer protection from commotio cordis and may offer a false sense of security. Almost 20% of the victims in competitive football, baseball, lacrosse and hockey were wearing protectors. This ineffectiveness has been confirmed by animal studies. Development of adequate chest protectors may prove difficult.|$|E

25|$|Guardian is {{designed}} to operate autonomously, without input from the flight crew. An array of sensors detects a missile approaching the aircraft and passes this information to an infrared tracking camera. The system's computer analyses the input signals, {{to confirm that the}} threat is real, and then directs a beam of an eye-safe infrared laser at the incoming object. The laser is intended to introduce a false target into the missile's guidance system, causing it to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. The detect-track-jam process lasts for two to three seconds. The system then automatically notifies the pilot and air traffic control that a threat has been jammed.|$|E

25|$|The arm ball {{has also}} been {{employed}} {{with a great deal}} of success over the years by left arm orthodox bowlers. In this case, the stock ball will <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right handed batsman and the arm-ball would swing in, allowing the bowler to beat the inside edge of the bat and attack the stumps. Hedley Verity in particular was well known for his fast inswinging arm-ball, often bowled at yorker length. Ravindra Jadeja provided an amazing display of arm balls against England and Australia during India's 2016-17 home season. His arm balls were hugely effective on some of the flat pitches where there were little turn, and while playing for that little turn, batsmen got deceived and edged it, In spinning pitches he utilised the rough for his spinning deliveries, occasionally getting an arm ball in to disturb the batsman.|$|E

25|$|Like rural Alberta, Calgary {{has always}} {{gone for the}} most right-wing party on the ballot since the 1993 election, with one exception: Progressive Conservative Joe Clark in Calgary Centre in 2000, with his notability of being a former prime {{minister}} and the controversy of Stockwell Day's stances on same-sex marriage being an issue that caused many voters in that riding to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Alliance candidate Eric Lowther and support Clark instead. With Clark having retired by the next election, Calgary returned to a Conservative sweep in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011. The Conservatives won an outright majority of the votes cast in each Calgary riding from 2004 to 2011, with vote-splitting of the residual minority of the vote among the Liberals, NDP and Greens causing none of the races to even be close.|$|E
500|$|Frank Black and the Catholics {{became the}} first album to be posted to the eMusic service; they claim it is [...] "the first album ever made legally {{available}} for commercial download." [...] Critical reception to the album was mixed, with some writers noting Thompson's seemingly deliberate <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "quirkiness" [...] of the Pixies and his early solo work for a self-consciously straightforward approach, and the [...] "disappointingly straightforward punk-pop" [...] musical style present on the album.|$|E

It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons." [...] Tucker would also describe the show as a [...] "pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family." ...|$|E

Personnel were instructed to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blast, shut their eyes, and cradle their arm across their face for additional protection.

500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is an {{initiation}} story. Nick's father (Dr. Adams) exposes {{his young}} son to [...] childbirth and, unintentionally, to violent death—an experience that causes Nick to equate childbirth with death. Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in [...] "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in [...] "butchery-style" [...] birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when he {{turns away from the}} butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's [...] "heightened awareness" [...] of evil causes him to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> experience. Although Nick may not want to watch the caesarian, his father insists he watch - he does not want his son to be initiated into an adult world without toughness, writes Thomas Strychacz.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} was {{generally}} well received by fans of the show, it is considered {{a turning point in}} the show's history; many fans believe that the television series has declined in quality since the film's release.

[...] After the film's release, fans [...] "began to <b>turn</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show," [...] causing fansites to [...] "bec deserted."
