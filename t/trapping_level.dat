40|$|Interaction of {{internal}} gravity waves with a horizontal shear {{flow in the}} absence of potential vorticity perturbations is investigated making use of closed-form solutions. Localized wave packet trajectories are obtained, the energy growth mechanisms occurring are identified, and the potential role of perturbation growth in wave breaking is assessed. Regarding meridional propagation, the wave packet motion is limited by turning levels where the waves are reflected and trapping levels where the waves stagnate. Regarding perturbation energy amplification, two growth mechanisms can be distinguished: growth due to advection of zonal velocity and growth due to downgradient Reynolds stresses. The three-dimensional perturbations producing optimal energy growth reveal that these two mechanisms produce large and robust amplification of zonal velocity and/or density and vertical velocity, potentially leading to shear or convective instability. For large static stability, amplification of density perturbations in conjunction with vertical orientation of the constant phase lines close to the <b>trapping</b> <b>level</b> potentially leads to a convective collapse of the wave packet near the <b>trapping</b> <b>level,</b> in agreement with existing direct numerical simulation studies. For lower static stability and for waves with phase lines oriented horizontally, growth due to advection of zonal velocity dominates, leading to rapid growth of streamwise streaks within the localized wave packet and potentially to shear instability. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} reduction or ghosting {{mechanism of}} x-ray photoconductor is studied based on Monte Carlo simulation techniques. We have calculated the sensitivity reduction for different detector operating conditions (applied electric field, x-ray spectrum and photoconductor thickness) and for {{different levels of}} carrier trapping. We have analyzed the effect of photoconductor biasing (positive or negative) on ghosting. The following effects {{are taken into account}} in modeling the ghosting phenomena: (i) recombination between trapped and oppositely charged drifting carriers, (ii) trap filling, (iii) nonuniform electric field, (iv) detrapping of trapped holes, and (v) x-ray induced trap generation. Our calculation shows that not only the recombination between trapped and oppositely charged drifting carriers but the x-ray induced trap generation is also responsible for ghosting in photoconductor based x-ray image detectors. Moreover not all the trapped carriers take part in recombination; rather {{only a fraction of the}} trapped carriers are involved in recombination. Electric field also plays an important role in ghosting calculations via the electron hole pair generation mechanism. Trap filling has also non trivial effects on ghosting. The simulation results show that the amount of ghosting strongly depends on the applied electric field. Ghosting increases with decreasing applied electric field and vice versa. It is observed that ghosting is higher at high carrier <b>trapping</b> <b>level</b> than at low <b>trapping</b> <b>level.</b> Again ghosting is more pronounced in chest radiographic detector than mammographic detector. In chest radiographic detector, carrier trapping is high due to greater thickness hence recombination and electric field effects are prominent in chest radiographic detector. Biasing dependent ghosting depends on the carrier mobility lifetime product. For positively biased detectors, ghosting is less if the mobility lifetime product of hole is higher than that of electron and vice versa for negatively biased detectors. It also appears that the use of only recombination to calculate ghosting, as believed the primary source of ghosting in some literatures, will lead to significant error in the calculation of ghosting...|$|E

40|$|In) GaAsN alloys {{with a few}} percent N {{have shown}} {{significant}} promise {{for a wide range}} of applications. However, N incorporation degrades the optical and electronic properties of GaAsN, which has not been sufficiently accounted for by any theory. Thus, the objective of this dissertation is to develop an understanding of the formation of N-related extrinsic and intrinsic point defects and their influence on the electronic properties of InGaAsN alloys. The presence of extrinsic N-related point defect, Si-N complexes, is suggested by a decrease in carrier concentration, n, with increasing N-composition in GaAsN:Si films but not modulation-doped heterostructures. For GaAsN:Te (GaAsN:Si), n increases substantially (minimally) with rapid thermal annealing (RTA) T, suggesting a competition between annealing-induced Si-N complex formation and a reduced concentration of N-related traps. Since Si-N complex formation is enhanced for GaAsN:Si growth with the (2 x 4) reconstruction, which has limited group V sites for As-N exchange, the (Si-N) As interstitial pair is identified as the dominant Si-N complex. Finally, using modulation-doped GaAs(N) /AlGaAs heterostructures, neutral scatterers, likely N interstitials, were identified as the dominant source of carrier scattering in the absence of Si-N complexes. For intrinsic N-related defects, we compared GaAsN films before and after RTA. For as-grown GaAs 1 -xNx films, an onset of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) at a much higher n than that in GaAs is observed, accompanied by a shrinkage of the electron Bohr radius, aB, with increasing x. In addition, the T-dependence of n for T> 150 K suggests the presence of a N-induced electron <b>trapping</b> <b>level</b> below the GaAsN CB edge, accompanied by a persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect. After RTA, a transition occurs in the low T transport mechanism from hopping to extended band conduction, the T-dependence of n is suppressed, and the PPC effect vanishes. Interestingly, NRA reveals an RTA-induced decrease in N interstitial fraction, fint; the corresponding signatures for the reduction in fint are also identified in Raman spectra. Thus, it is likely that N interstitials are responsible for the MIT, the aB shrinkage, the N-induced <b>trapping</b> <b>level,</b> and the PPC effect. Thus, N interstitials are the dominant form of intrinsic N defects in GaAsN...|$|E
