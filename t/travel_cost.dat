He can purchase these products in several cities, but at different prices and not all cities offer the same products. The objective {{is to find a}} route between a subset of the cities, which minimizes total cost (<b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> + purchasing cost) and which enables the purchase of all required products.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 season saw Syrian clubs {{join the}} competition, thus {{increasing}} the number of participating countries to 15, and two years later, following their transfer into the AFC in 2006, Australian clubs were also included in the tournament. Owing to the lack of professionalism in Asian football, many problems still existed in the tournament, such as on field violence and late submission of player registration. Many blamed the lack of prize money and expensive <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> as some of the reasons.|$|E
25|$|The first inter-colonial cricket {{match to}} be played at the MCG was between Victoria and New South Wales in March 1856. Victoria had played Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) as early as 1851 but the Victorians had {{included}} two professionals in the 1853 team upsetting the Tasmanians and causing a cooling of {{relations between the two}} colonies. To replace the disgruntled Tasmanians the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to play any team in the colonies for £1000. Sydney publican William Tunks accepted the challenge on behalf of New South Wales although the Victorians were criticised for playing for money. Ethics aside, New South Wales could not afford the £1000 and only managed to travel to Melbourne after half the team’s <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> of £181 was put up by Sydney barrister Richard Driver.|$|E
40|$|To attract golf patrons, sport {{managers}} {{must understand}} consumption {{patterns of the}} golfer. Importantly, the treatment of <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> must be understood. According to the Alchian-Allen (1964) theorem, golfers treat <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> as bundled costs (third law of economic demand) whereas classical consumer theory indicates that golfers treat <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> as sunk costs (first law of economic demand). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if golf patrons treated <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> as sunk costs or if they treated <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> as a bundled cost. Data from a survey of course patrons in Ohio support the treatment of <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> as bundled costs by golf course patrons, especially those classified as tourists. Managers should utilize geographic segmentation in choosing whom to market their course based upon their product’s price compared to area competitors, as shown by the strong, positive correlation found between distance traveled and cost of green fees. ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike most leagues today, where {{income is}} {{generated}} from sponsors and TV {{in addition to}} ticket sales, the Gauliga teams relied on ticket sales as the exclusive source of income. But while in today's leagues the hosting teams keep the cash from the ticket sales, this was handled differently in the Gauligen. In the regular season, in cup matches or other competitive matches, the money was shared between the German Football Association, who received 5% of the income, the hosting club and the hosted club. In particular, the hosting club received 10% for using their ground and 5% for administrative costs. The remaining 75% of the matchday income were shared between the two clubs. These relations changed for the play-offs for the German championship. Here the matches were usually played on neutral ground, therefore 15% of the income were allotted for renting the ground, administrative cost and <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> for the teams. The remaining income was divided equally between the clubs and the DFB. For the semi-final and final matches, yet another distribution key was applied. In the semi-final, teams received 20% of the net income (that is, after rent, administrative and travel costs had been deducted) and in the final their share was reduced to 15%.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2009, a {{competition}} called the [...] "Up to Now Pub Quiz" [...] was launched on Facebook. Fans {{were required to}} create teams of five, and were posed with ten questions, related to the band's entire career, each week. The team with the most correct answers at the end will fly to London {{to see one of}} the concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, with a certain part of <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> paid. The team will be allotted their own private box at the venue, and will get a chance to meet the band afterward. Along the same lines, a Swiss radio station 20 Minuten hosted a similar competition for listeners. They had a pair of tickets for the concert for the Royal Albert Hall concert of 24 November to give away. All flight and hotel accommodation costs were paid for by the radio station. UK radio station Xfm organized {{a competition}} called [...] "Xfm's Snow Patrol Bad Photoshop Challenge", with ten pairs of tickets were up to win. These tickets would enable fans to see the band rehearse in a yet-unnamed location in Brighton at the eve of the Reworked Tour. The challenge was to associate five photoshopped pictures with Snow Patrol song titles. The competition will end on 10 November 2009. A further fifteen pairs of tickets will be given away on air. Tickets for the intimate acoustic show in London for the promotion of Up to Now could only be obtained via two competitions, one organized on Play.com and the other on the band's official website. Both involved answering a simple question. For the HMV singing and performance, wristbands were available from 9am on 3 December 2009. One band was assigned to one person, however, it was not necessary to have one to see the band perform. The bands were required only {{to gain access to the}} signing. Tickets for the mini-festival at Ward Park will go on pre-sale on 9 December 2009, and on general sale on the 11th, priced at £44.|$|E
