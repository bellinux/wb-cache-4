40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveThe use of {{ultrasound}} for needle correct {{placement and}} local anesthetic spread monitoring helped {{to reduce the}} volume of local anesthetic required for peripheral nerve blocks. There are few studies of the minimum <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of local anesthetic for axillary brachial plexus block. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the minimum <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> (VE 90) of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with epinephrine (1 : 200, 000) for ultrasound guided ABPB. MethodMassey and Dixon's up-and-down method was used to calculate the minimum <b>effective</b> <b>volume.</b> The initial dose was 5 mL per nerve (radial, median, ulnar, and musculocutaneous). In case of blockade failure, the volume was increased to 0. 5 mL per nerve. A successful blockade resulted in decreased volume of 0. 5 mL per nerve to the next patient. Successful blockade was defined as a motor block ≤ 2, according to the modified Bromage scale; lack of thermal sensitivity; and response to pinprick. The achievement of five cases of failure followed by success cases was defined as criterion to complete the study. Results 19 patients were included in the study. The minimum <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> (VE 90) of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine was 1. 56 mL (95 % CI, 0. 99 – 3. 5) per nerve.

These two results are further related by a scaling argument based on Euler 2 ̆ 7 s theorem. The key new ingredient in the constructions is a two-form potential for the static Killing field.

Thus, the main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the volumes of local anesthetics in parasacral and infragluteal-parabiceps sciatic nerve block (SNB). MethodsOne hundred and one patients undergoing infragluteal-parabiceps or parasacral SNB with 0. 5 % ropivacaine or 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 5 μg. mL- 1 of adrenaline were randomly divided into 4 groups. Success was defined as complete sensitive and motor blockades of the sciatic nerve 30 minutes after the administration of the LA. Volumes were calculated by the up-and-down method. ResultsIn the parasacral approach, the mean <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of ropivacaine was 17. 6 mL (95 % CI: 14. 9 - 20. 8) and of bupivacaine it was 16. 4 mL (95 % CI: 12. 3 - 21. 9). In the infragluteal-parabiceps approach, the mean <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> of ropivacaine was 21. 8 mL (95 % CI: 18. 7 - 25. 5), and that of bupivacaine was 20. 4 mL (95 % CI: 18. 6 - 22. 5). Volumes were significantly lower (p < 0. 01) in the parasacral than in the infragluteal-parabiceps approach. In Probit regression, the estimated <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> in 95 % of the patients in the parasacral approach was 21. 8 mL for ropivacaine, and 20. 5 mL for bupivacaine; in the infragluteal-parabiceps approach the volumes were 27. 2 mL for ropivacaine and 25. 5 mL for bupivacaine. The <b>effective</b> <b>volume</b> in 99 % of the patients in parasacral SNB was 24 mL for ropivacaine, and 24 mL for bupivacaine; and in the infragluteal-parabiceps approach, 29. 9 mL for ropivacaine, and 28. 0 mL for bupivacaine.

Four different flow rates (10, 20, 40, and 70 times the <b>effective</b> <b>tank</b> <b>volume</b> per day) were set up in triplicate tanks within each of three rigs with recirculated, UV-radiated, and untreated water, respectively. Each of the 36 tanks was stocked with 200 weaned cod juveniles at a mean weight of 0. 048 g. Fish mortality was recorded daily in all tanks, and growth (wet weight) was determined {{at the end of}} the experiment. The microflora in the rearing water was investigated by means of PCR-DGGE and flow cytometry. Observed mortality was significantly higher at low flow rates while otherwise unexplained mortality (presumed to be due to cannibalism) was lowest in the recirculation system. No correlation was found between survival and growth. Growth was significantly affected by both water exchange rate and treatment, as the juveniles from high flow rates and the UV-treatment showed elevated growth rates. Both growth and survival scaled in accordance with metabolic factors like oxygen saturation and unionized ammonia. Bacterial concentrations increased in all tanks and treatment from the beginning of the experiment to the end. The UV-treated and untreated water started at typical seawater concentrations (0. 5 − 1 × 10 'raised to the sixth power' mLˉ¹) and increased five to tenfold during the experiment. The recycled water tanks started with bacterial concentrations 2 – 5 times higher than the UV- and untreated experiments at the time of fish transfer, and ended up with 10 times higher concentrations in the end. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles separated the recirculation tanks, including the respective inlet water, from the flow-through systems, with one exception (the highest flow rate). Eighty-five% of the sequences clustered within the Gammaproteobacteria, further divided into four distinct clusters.
