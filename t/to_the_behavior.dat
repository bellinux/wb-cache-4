25|$|To {{deal with}} predators such as birds, mammals, amphibians, and spiders, some species glue debris onto their bodies, while many play dead when disturbed. Many species {{practice}} autotomy; they detach their legs, which keep on moving {{for a period}} of time after, presumably to distract predators. Especially long-legged species vibrate their bodies ("bobbing"), probably also to confuse predators. This is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of the similar-looking but unrelated cellar spider, which vibrates wildly in its web when touched. Scent glands emit substances that can deter larger predators, but are also effective against ants.|$|E

25|$|Biocompatibility {{is related}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of {{biomaterials}} in various environments under various chemical and physical conditions.

For example, a material may elicit little or no immune response in a given organism, and {{may or may not}} able to integrate with a particular cell type or tissue. The ambiguity of the term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials interact with the human body and eventually how those interactions determine the clinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker or hip replacement). Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one material—so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility of a specific material.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E
25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of human listeners.|$|E
