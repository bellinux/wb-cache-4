2500|$|His first movie, 12 Angry Men, was an auspicious {{beginning}} for Lumet. It {{was a critical}} success and established Lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures.

[...] "It told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the right path," [...] she said. Fully half of Lumet's complement of films have originated in the theater.|$|E

3000|$|From my own {{observations}} in East Africa {{it seems that}} in many species the killing of apical buds of stems and the main lateral buds, results in development of secondary lateral and adventitious buds, the outcome being the building up of an orchard-like tree or shrub form.

2500|$|Nadezhda von Meck was a professed atheist, {{which was}} not unusual in aristocratic Russia in the 1870s. Her fierce need for independence, on the other hand, was very unusual for {{a woman of the}} time. Her {{division}} between that and concern for her family resulted in contradictions between her beliefs and actions. Her views on affairs of the heart were strictly moral, but she did not believe in marriage as a social institution and regularly professed her hatred of it to Tchaikovsky.
