5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> severed head.|$|E
5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be {{because he was a}} child of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he was a child of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E

5|$|The Draupadi cult {{emphasizes}} another boon: Krishna allows Aravan {{to witness}} the entire duration of the Mahabharata war through <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> severed head. In another 18-day festival, the ceremonial head of Aravan is hoisted on a post {{to witness the}} ritual re-enactment of the Mahabharata war. The head of Aravan is a common motif in Draupadi temples. Often it is a portable wooden head; sometimes it even has its own shrine in the temple complex or {{is placed on the}} corners of temple roofs as a guardian against spirits. Aravan is worshipped in the form of his severed head and is believed to cure disease and induce pregnancy in childless women.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{stood against}} this measure, {{as he had}} against nearly all Reconstruction laws. A lack of {{consensus}} delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame-duck session beginning in December 1874. By that time, disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid-term elections. When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875, the House would have a Democratic majority {{for the first time}} since the Civil War. In the meantime, the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner's civil rights bill; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand-still, hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended. Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill, at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours. In the end, the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes, but not enough to defeat the bill, which passed by a vote of 162 to 100. Despite the defeat, Randall's filibuster increased his prominence in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Democratic colleagues.|$|E

25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister.

25|$|Boromir {{is portrayed}} as a noble {{character}} who believes passionately in the greatness of his kingdom, who would have defended its people to the last. Boromir's great stamina and physical strength, together with a forceful and commanding personality, made him a widely admired commander in Gondor's army: he was made Captain of the White Tower, and quickly became Captain-General, also bearing the title High Warden of the White Tower. He was also heir apparent to the Stewardship. Boromir led many successful forays against Sauron's forces, prior to his journey north to Rivendell, which brought him great esteem in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father, Denethor.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{brilliant}} victory, {{only one}} event could remove {{the stigma of}} usurper completely from <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects — recovery of Constantinople itself. In 1260 Michael personally led an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city. Rumors of reinforcements for the beleagued city forced Michael to sign a one-year truce with the Latin Emperor Baldwin II that August. Realizing that he needed a navy to effectively besiege Constantinople, Michael concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum with Genoa in March of the following year. Genoese help proved to be unneeded when Michael VIII's general Alexios Strategopoulos captured Constantinople from Baldwin II through treachery on 25 July 1261.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E
25|$|Many of the victims' bodies bore {{evidence}} of mutilation {{to the eye}} sockets. Pathologists concluded the injuries were caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims. Chikatilo's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas {{using a variety of}} ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim, such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
500|$|In {{speech in}} Chidambaram, Mahatma Gandhi called Nandanar, a true {{practitioner}} of Satyagraha, {{a means of}} Nonviolent resistance. Gandhi said: [...] "Nanda broke every barrier and won his way to freedom, not by brag, not by bluster, but by the purest form of self-suffering... he shamed them [...] into doing justice by his lofty prayer, by the purity of his character, ... he compelled God Himself to descend and made Him open <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> persecutors".|$|E

500|$|Two weeks later, Wilson {{travelled}} to Salisbury {{to continue}} the talks. The British Prime Minister proposed that future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament might be safeguarded by the revocation of some of Salisbury's self-governing powers, held since 1923. This was a horrific prospect in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Rhodesian opponents, and proved the final straw for Smith's government. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence was signed by the Rhodesian Cabinet on 11 November 1965, to almost unanimous international acrimony. The next day the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 216, which condemned the declaration as an illegal one [...] "made by a racist minority", and called on all member states to withhold diplomatic recognition.|$|E
500|$|If {{the capture}} of Petra {{redeemed}} Bessas in <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries, his subsequent actions tarnished it again: instead of following up his success and capture the mountain passes connecting Lazica with the Persian province of Iberia, he retired west to the Roman provinces of Pontica and busied himself with its administration. This inactivity allowed the Persians under Mihr-Mihroe to consolidate Persian control over {{the eastern part of}} Lazica. The Byzantine forces in Lazica withdrew west to the mouth of the Phasis, while the Lazi, including their king Gubazes and his family, sought refuge in the mountains. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551–552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers conveyed by envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. In 552, the Persians received substantial reinforcements, but their attacks on the fortresses held by the Byzantines and the Lazi were repulsed.|$|E
