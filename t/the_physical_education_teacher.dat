Method The subjects were investigated regarding voice complaint and the VHI was applied.

The three domains of the VHI were correlated with the indices of HRV. Results <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> presented a VHI score much below the standard of the physiological normality.
