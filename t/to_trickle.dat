Henry II bankrolled Guise with a sum of 150,000 écus, likely for bribes, and additional French cardinals began <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> into the conclave: Georges d'Amboise and Philippe de la Chambre on December 28; Jean de Lorraine on December 31; and (the extremely elderly) Louis de Bourbon on January 14.|$|E
5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the refugee crisis could not {{continue}} indefinitely was emphasized in January 1996 when Burundi closed the two camps within its borders and told the refugees that they should return to Rwanda.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to Ballard's earlier novel The Drowned World, The Burning World describes {{a world in}} which water is scarce. After an extensive drought, rivers have turned <b>to</b> <b>trickles</b> and the earth to dust, causing the world's populations to head toward the oceans in search of water. The drought is caused by industrial waste flushed into the ocean, which form an oxygen-permeable barrier of saturated long-chain polymers that prevents evaporation and destroys the precipitation cycle.|$|R

25|$|Stone aqueducts, {{sometimes}} spanning miles, brought {{fresh water}} from a river or spring to the mission site. Baked clay pipes, joined with lime mortar or bitumen, carried the water into reservoirs and gravity-fed fountains, and emptied into waterways where {{the force of the}} water would be used to turn grinding wheels, presses, and other simple machinery. Water brought to the mission proper would be used for cooking, cleaning, irrigation of crops, and drinking. Drinking water was allowed <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> through alternate layers of sand and charcoal to remove the impurities.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, the {{government}} dispatched the Custer Expedition {{to examine the}} Black Hills. The Lakota were alarmed at his expedition. Before Custer's column had returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln, news of their discovery of gold was telegraphed nationally. The presence of valuable mineral resources was confirmed the following year by the Newton–Jenney Geological Expedition. Prospectors, motivated by the economic panic of 1873, began <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> into the Black Hills {{in violation of the}} Fort Laramie Treaty. This trickle turned into a flood as thousands of miners invaded the Hills before the gold rush was over. Organized groups came from states as far away as New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and exhaust steam {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E

25|$|The rarest {{reported}} type of Eucharistic miracle {{is where}} the Eucharist becomes human flesh as in the miracle of Lanciano which some Catholics believe occurred at Lanciano, Italy, in the 8th century A.D. In fact, Lanciano {{is only one of}} the reported cases of Eucharistic miracles where the host has been transformed into human flesh. However, a Eucharistic miracle more commonly reported by Catholics is that of the Bleeding Host, where blood starts <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> from a consecrated host, the bread consecrated during Mass. Other types of purported miracles include consecrated hosts being preserved for hundreds of years, such as the event of the Miraculous Hosts of Siena. Other miracles include a consecrated host passing through a fire unscathed, stolen consecrated hosts vanishing and turning up in churches, and levitating consecrated hosts.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, {{the pace}} of {{structural}} reforms, including fiscal, monetary policies, taxation, privatization and new business legislations, helped Egypt move towards a more market-oriented economy and prompted increased foreign investment. The reforms and policies have strengthened macroeconomic annual growth results which averaged 8% annually between 2004 and 2009 but the government largely failed to equitably share the wealth {{and the benefits of}} growth have failed <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> down to improve economic conditions for the broader population, especially with the growing problem of unemployment and underemployment.

25|$|Over {{the ensuing}} months, because of regular visits {{by the army}} during which they were threatened, harassed, and intimidated, most of the {{survivors}} abandoned the village for the mountains, other towns and villages, or Guatemala City. In 1985, they began <b>to</b> <b>trickle</b> back and were allowed to resettle in Plan de Sánchez and work their land, provided that they served in the PACs and remained subject at all times to military oversight. By 1987, some 20 families were again living in the village, albeit under strict orders from the military not to discuss the massacre. The harassment and threats from the military and paramilitaries continued, and the requirement that they patrol with the PACs was enforced, until the peace accords were signed and the civilian self-defence patrols were dissolved in 1996.|$|E
