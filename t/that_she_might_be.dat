5|$|During Maya's {{final year}} of high school, she worries <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a lesbian (which she equates with being a hermaphrodite), and initiates sexual {{intercourse}} with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which {{on the advice of}} her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school.

5|$|Sanger's goal of {{challenging}} {{the law was}} fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception. Afraid <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.|$|E

5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept {{that this was an}} independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to contrive further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion.

5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition.

The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13.

She took over as Raven's foremost enemy after Bianca left.

25|$|Blunt {{is staying}} in Belvile's house. Florinda enters, sees Blunt and asks him for help.

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 17 July 2008, a woman was {{approached}} by Ghazni Province police officers {{in the city of}} Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor's compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer's suspicion, raising concerns <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan where women are generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy that she said was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy's name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police she was looking for her husband, needed no help, and started to walk away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. (The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after hospitalized and fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.|$|E
