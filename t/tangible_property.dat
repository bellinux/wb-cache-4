25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E
25|$|The {{trespass}} to chattels tort punishes {{anyone who}} substantially {{interferes with the}} use of another's personal property, or chattels. Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff's interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a quantifiable harm to their <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.|$|E
25|$|Sheriffs in Kentucky {{are elected}} for {{four-year}} terms {{and are not}} term limited. Kentucky sheriffs are not the chief law enforcement officials of their respective counties. That title is reserved for the Coroner. Sheriffs and deputies in Kentucky {{have the authority to}} patrol as well as power of arrest in all areas of their particular county, including incorporated cities. Most sheriffs, however, choose to patrol incorporated cities either only on the request of city officials {{or in the case of}} a major emergency. Sheriff's deputies will jointly patrol unincorporated areas of their county with the Kentucky State Police. In addition, sheriffs in Kentucky are responsible for court security, serving court papers and transporting prisoners. They are also responsible for collecting taxes on real estate and <b>tangible</b> <b>property.</b> Also, Kentucky law states that only the county coroner, also an elected peace officer, can serve the sitting sheriff with a state criminal court process or place him/her under arrest (any peace officer, however, can arrest the coroner).|$|E

Buried Cultural Properties were introduced as a new category, separate from <b>Tangible</b> Cultural <b>Properties.</b> In addition, a designation system was established for Important Intangible Cultural <b>Properties</b> and Important <b>Tangible</b> Folk <b>Properties.</b>|$|R

500|$|Alastair Hudson {{wrote that}} [...] "doctrinally, it is {{suggested}} that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon". Firstly, it contradicts an element of property law which requires there be [...] "specific and identifiable property" [...] to be subject to a property right. Secondly, he suggests {{it is difficult to see}} why there should be a dividing line between intangible and <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> since there are some principles which apply to both. 500 ball bearings are tangible, but identical; under Hunter, there is no reason these should also not require separation, so the distinction between tangible and intangible is thus [...] "spurious".|$|E
500|$|This {{is part of}} the [...] "orthodox" [...] or [...] "strict" [...] rule, {{along with}} Re Goldcorp. The {{exception}} to this rule is found in Hunter v Moss, which concerned 50 shares meant to be transferred to an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares were transferred. This was applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> such as wine, and intangible property, such as shares. Intangible property, by its very nature, does not require segregation.|$|E

500|$|Hunter v Moss [...] 1 WLR 452 is an English trusts law {{case from}} the Court of Appeal {{concerning}} the certainty of subject matter necessary to form a trust. Moss promised Hunter 50 shares in his company {{as part of an}} employment contract, but failed to provide them. Hunter brought a claim against Moss for them, arguing that Moss's promise had created a trust over those 50 shares. The constitution of trusts normally requires that trust property be segregated from non-trust property for the trust to be valid, as in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd. On this occasion, however, both Colin Rimer in the High Court of Justice and Dillon, Mann and Hirst LJJ in the Court of Appeal felt that, because this case dealt with intangible rather than <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> this rule {{did not have to be}} applied. Because all the shares were identical, it did not matter that they were not segregated, and the trust was valid. The decision was applied in Re Harvard Securities, [...] creating a rule that segregation is not always necessary when the trust concerns intangible, identical property.|$|E

2500|$|Law professor, {{writer and}} {{political}} activist Lawrence Lessig, {{along with many}} other copyleft and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. Stephan Kinsella has objected to intellectual property {{on the grounds that the}} word [...] "property" [...] implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.|$|E
2500|$|... magine {{the time}} when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, {{this is a good}} idea, and others notice it. They {{naturally}} imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the <b>tangible</b> <b>property</b> (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule {{flies in the face of}} the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.|$|E

It has a practical and constructive air, it deals with impressively enormous amounts of <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> it rests with a comforting effect of solidity upon assumptions that are at once doubtful and desirable. It seems free from metaphysical considerations, and it has none of those disconcerting personal applications, those penetrations towards intimate qualities, that makes eugenics, for example, faintly but persistently uncomfortable. It is indeed an ideal problem for a healthy, hopeful, and progressive middle-aged public man. And, as I say, it deals with enormous amounts of <b>tangible</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
