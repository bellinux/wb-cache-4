40|$|Europe’s passenger-car {{efficiency}} regulation {{has very}} effectively driven down the official average CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption of new passenger {{cars in the}} EU. The 2015 target of 130 grams of CO 2 per kilometer (g/km) was met two years ahead of schedule and manufacturers are making good progress towards the 2020 / 21 target of 95 g/km. But beneath this apparent success there is cause for concern. The basis for the regulation are results obtained under laboratory conditions using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) —the so-called certification or “type-approval” values. To make real progress, however, the results recorded in the laboratory must translate dependably into CO 2 reductions and fuel-consumption savings experienced on the road. This study, which builds on and extends the analysis begun in 2012 and continued in 2013, demonstrates that the year-over-year improvements reported via the <b>type-approval</b> <b>tests</b> are not reliably matched in everyday driving—and that {{the gap between the}} vehicle emissions testing laboratory and the real world of the road is getting wider...|$|R
40|$|Road {{transport}} {{exhaust emissions}} represent the {{main sources of}} atmospheric pollution in urban areas, due to {{the growing number of}} circulating vehicles and travelled distances. In order to re-duce this pollution source, stricter emission standards are periodically set by governments through-out the world. Consequently, the concentrations of gaseous pollutants and particulate mass to be measured during <b>type-approval</b> <b>tests</b> of new vehicles are becoming progressively lower; moreover from 2011, diesel cars have to comply with particle number limit. In order to assess emission le-vels of different technology vehicles and investigate the use of a particulate number measurement technique at the exhaust of very low-emitting vehicles, an experimental activity was carried out on three in-use vehicles: a diesel car equipped with a particulate trap (DPF), a hybrid gasoline-elec-tric car and a bi-fuel passenger car fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG). Cold and hot ga-seous and particulate emission factors and fuel consumption were measured during the execution of real and regulatory driving cycles on a chassis dynamometer.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the state of technology of pollutant emissions from 50 types of motorcycles, and {{on the basis of the}} measurements carried out to estimate the potential for reducing emissions with a view to future limit values. The vehicles tested were distributed between the various categories of vehicle on the basis of the figures for new registrations in the years 1996, 1997 and the first half of 1998 supplied by the Federal Motor Vehicle Office. The vehicle types were selected on the basis amongst other things of the statistics ('league table') of the Industrieverband Motorrad Deutschland e. V (IVM). For the categories light motorcycles and motorcycles the programme of investigation included gaseous emission measurements as per ECE Regulation 40 and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) for passenger cars. Mopeds were tested in accordance with ECE Regulation 47 and at full power. Motorcycles with lambda-regulated catalytic converters were in addition subjected to gaseous emission testing carried out by analogy with the test regulations applying to passenger cars with lambda-regulated catalytic converters. For 10 selected vehicles, evaporative emissions were determined by the SHED test (1 -hour hot soak test and 24 -hour tank breathing test). In one exemplary calculation, a motorcycle was found to have four-and-a-half times the fuel consumption (in relation to its engine size and tare weight) of a small car. Evaporative emissions can be reduced by at least 76 % by the introduction of a limit value of 2 g HC. The introduction of gaseous emission testing for motorcycles would ensure that the CO limit at idling speed applied in the <b>type-approval</b> <b>test</b> would also be maintained in service. Where limit values are exceeded, adjustments to the engine are successful in 97 % of cases. (orig.)

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the evaporative emissions control systems of European passenger cars on the basis of real-world activity data. The study relies on two large datasets of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems, consisting of 4. 5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28, 000 vehicles over one month. Real world evaporative emissions are estimated using a model that associates a carbon canister desorption event to each trip and a fuel vapour generation event to each parking. The mass of volatile organic compounds released into the air is calculated taking into account the hot-soak, permeation and breathing emission mechanisms. The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to evaporative emissions values above the current type approval limit (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle). In July, these numbers increase to 10 out of the 18 scenarios for Modena and to 12 out of the 18 scenarios for Firenze. Looking at the fleet distribution a share of approximately 20 % of the fleet is characterised by evaporative emissions higher than the limit in May, increasing to 48 % in July, with a peak value of 98 %. The emission peak value is estimated to be approximately 4 [g/day] in May and 8 [g/day] in July, while the time-dependent results show emission rates up to nearly 15 [g/s] in Modena and 30 [g/s] in Firenze, with a respective cumulative value in July up to 0. 4 and 0. 8 tons of VOCs per day. The space-dependent results show a value of the emissions in July of approximately 4 -to- 8 [kg/km 2 /day] in the city areas.

40|$|International audienceEuropean {{emission}} {{trends of}} nitrogen oxides since 1880 {{and up to}} present are presented here and {{are linked to the}} evolution of road transport emissions. Road transport has been the dominating source of NO x emissions since 1970, and contributes with 40 % to the total emissions in 2005. Five trend regimes have been identified between 1880 and 2005. The first regime (1880 ? 1950) is determined by a slow increase in fuel consumption all over Europe. The second regime (1950 ? 1980) is characterized by a continued steep upward trend in liquid fuel use and by the introduction of the first regulations on road traffic emissions. Reduction in fuel consumption determines the emission trends in the third regime (1980 ? 1990) that is also characterized by important differences between Eastern and Western Europe. Emissions from road traffic continue to grow in Western Europe in this period, and it is argued here that the reason for this continued NO x emission increase is related to early inefficient regulations for NO x in the transport sector. The fourth regime (1990 ? 2000) involves a turning point for road traffic emissions, with a general decrease of emissions in Europe during that decade. It is in this period that we can identify the first emission reductions due to technological abatement in Western Europe. In the fifth regime (2000 ? 2005), the economic recovery in Eastern Europe imposes increased emission from road traffic in this area. Western European emissions are on the other hand decoupled from the fuel consumption, and continue to decrease. The implementation of strict measures to control NO x emissions is demonstrated here to be a main reason for the continued Western European emission reductions. The results indicate that even though the effectiveness of European standards is hampered by a slow vehicle turnover, loopholes in the <b>type-approval</b> <b>testing,</b> and an increase in diesel consumption, the effect of such technical abatement measures is traceable in the evolution of European road traffic emissions over the last 15 years...|$|R
40|$|European {{nitrogen}} oxides emissions have declined more than 30 % since 1990, but are now increasing in eastern recovering economies. Road transport is the dominating source of NOx emissions since 1970, {{and with a}} 40 % share in 2005. This paper presents the effect of NOx abatement on road traffic emissions in Europe and focuses on the causes behind trends since 1880 and up to present. Trends in road traffic NOx emissions are influenced both by policy and technological constrains and socio-economic development. Five trend regimes are identified in Europe. The first regime (1880 - 1950) is determined by a slow increase in fuel consumption. The second regime from 1950 - 1980 {{is characterized by a}} continued steep upward trend in liquid fuel use, but the changes with respect to the previous period are determined by the introduction of the first regulations on road traffic emissions. Reduction in fuel consumption influences the emission trends in the third regime from 1980 - 1990. During this period, road emissions in Eastern Europe decrease due to recessive fuel consumption. Emissions from road traffic continue to grow in Western Europe from 1980 to 1990 despite the general decline and stabilisation in fuel consumption caused by the oil crisis in the 1970 s. It is argued here that the reason for this continued Western European NOx emission increase is the introduction of measures to improve combustion and fuel efficiency, and to control HC and CO. The fourth regime (1990 - 2000) involves a turning point for road traffic emissions, with general decrease of emissions in Europe during that decade. In Eastern Europe, decrease in emissions is linked to decline in fuel consumption in Former Soviet Republics, and to a reduced share of high NOx emitting vehicles in other eastern European countries. At the same time, the efficiency of technological abatement in Western Europe is instrumental to control road traffic emissions in this region despite the increase in fuel consumption. In the last regime, from 2000 to 2005, the economic recovery in Eastern Europe implies new increases in road traffic emissions in this area. However, emissions in Western Europe continue to decrease, despite the increase in fuel consumption, due to the implementation of strict measures to control NOx emissions. The results indicate that even though the effectiveness of European standards is hampered by a slow vehicle turnover, loopholes in the <b>type-approval</b> <b>testing</b> and an increase in diesel consumption, the effect of such technical abatement measures is still traceable in the evolution of European road traffic emissions over the last 15 years...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} of new passenger cars (PCs) registered in Europe are monitored {{in order to}} meet the objectives of Regulation EC 443 / 2009. This calls for an average CO 2 emission of 130 g/km for new PCs registered in Europe to be met by vehicle measures in 2015. This decreases to 95 g/km in 2020. Similar regulations are gradually promoted for other vehicle categories as well, more prominently for light commercial vehicles (LCVs). CO 2 {{emissions of}} new vehicle types are determined during the vehicle <b>type-approval</b> by <b>testing</b> over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Worries have been expressed that this driving cycle is not representative of real-world driving conditions. It is considered that fuel consumption, and hence CO 2 emissions (and air pollutant emissions), measured over this cycle under-represent reality. This report uses real-world information to compare in-use fuel consumption of PCs with type-approval CO 2. The main objective was to develop functions that may enable prediction of in-use fuel consumption values, based on vehicle specifications. The functions can then be used in inventorying tools, such as COPERT and HBEFA, to correctly allocate fuel consumption to the different PC vehicle types. JRC.

TfL commissioned a programme of laboratory testing {{to better understand the}} in-service emission performance of Euro 6 /VI vehicles over the TfL London Drive Cycle (LDC).

Twelve Euro 6 passenger cars were tested over the entire 140 kms of the LDC from a warm-start. Three HGVs were tested over the suburban sub-cycle (40 kms) in laden and un-laden condition. NOX emissions from the petrol cars were at a low level and below, or at, their type approval limit of 0. 06 g. km- 1. Only one SCR equipped diesel car achieved NOX emissions close to their 0. 08 g. km- 1 type approval limit.
