5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast of San Antonio and about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E

But we've always {{had a lot of}} people in the band so that's why I call the band the 'Large Band' and not the 'Big Band'. But invariably people refer to the band as the 'Big Band' and ... it's not big... you get the idea." ...|$|R

5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> a humid subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood. Local governments compromised with both the Seahawks and Mariners on the location of new ramps over the train tracks that run along the east sides of CenturyLink and Safeco Fields. An overpass for S Royal Brougham Way, the road <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> the south edge of the CenturyLink Field complex, to improve access and safety was completed in May 2010. The stadium has 2,000 parking spaces in its parking garage and 8,400 in the surrounding lots to accommodate automobile traffic. Beginning in December 2011, construction of the Stadium Place mixed-use development project replaced much of the north lot. The developer must replace the 500 lost parking spots and turn over parking revenue to the Public Stadium Authority per an agreement with King County.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood <b>that</b> <b>borders</b> the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} term Borders Railway to describe the reopened line was in a paper by the Corus Rail Consultancy in January 2004, entitled Delivering an innovative Borders Railway, which had been commissioned by the Waverley Route Trust. Previously, the Edinburgh–Tweedbank line had been variously described as the Waverley Railway and the Borders Rail Link. In mid-2014, Transport Scotland considered launching a competition for the public to submit their ideas for a name but the Scottish Borders Council was strongly opposed on the basis <b>that</b> <b>Borders</b> Railway had developed a strong brand identity. The use of Waverley Line or Waverley Route for the line was considered historically inaccurate by the Council and the Campaign for Borders Rail since these names were only ever used for the whole of the original line as far as Carlisle.|$|E
