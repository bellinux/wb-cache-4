5|$|Tech {{continued}} {{to run down}} the clock by running the ball straight ahead for a four-yard gain. Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, and running back Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick {{continued to}} advance the ball with short runs, draining the clock to secure the Tech lead.

5|$|The Seminoles {{returned}} Tech's post-score kick {{to their}} 15-yard line, where Florida State's offense began work again, hoping {{to regain the}} lead for State. Weinke completed a seven-yard pass to Warrick, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. Weinke overcame the loss on the next play with a 19-yard first-down pass. State continued to advance the ball with short passes, as Weinke completed a five-yard throw. Chaney gained three yards on a rush to the right as the final seconds {{of the third quarter}} <b>ticked</b> off the clock, setting up an important third-down play.

5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. <b>Ticked</b> or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that needed only three plays to score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded with a quick touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles needed only six plays, three of them passes from E. J. Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 mark. As the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds <b>ticked</b> off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E

5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time <b>ticked</b> below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by another incomplete pass, and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second <b>ticked</b> off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two major}} groups of ticks: soft <b>ticks</b> and hard <b>ticks.</b> The hard <b>ticks</b> {{comprise}} the prostriate <b>ticks</b> and the metastriate <b>ticks.</b> The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of one species of prostriate <b>tick</b> and two species of metastriate <b>ticks</b> had been sequenced prior to our study. The prostriate <b>tick</b> has the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the two metastriate <b>ticks</b> have rearrangements of eight genes and duplicate control regions. However, the arrangement of genes in the mt genomes of soft <b>ticks</b> had not been studied. We sequenced the mt genomes of two species of soft <b>ticks,</b> Carios capensis and Ornithodoros moubata, and a metastriate <b>tick,</b> Haemaphysalis flava. We found that the soft <b>ticks</b> have the ancestral arrangement of mt genes of arthropods, whereas the metastriate <b>tick,</b> H. flava, shares the rearrangements of mt genes and duplicate control regions {{with the other two}} metastriate <b>ticks</b> that have previously been studied. Our study indicates that gene rearrangements and duplicate control regions in mt genomes occurred once in the most recent common ancestor of metastriate <b>ticks,</b> whereas the ancestral arrangement of arthropods has remained unchanged for over 400 million years in the lineages leading to the soft <b>ticks</b> and the prostriate <b>ticks...</b>|$|R
40|$|When <b>ticks</b> feed, they inject {{numerous}} proteins {{into the}} host that modulate the host?s defense mechanism to <b>tick</b> feeding activity.

Thus immunization of animals with recombinant <b>tick</b> saliva proteins has been proposed. The strategy {{of this research}} is to deliver chimeric <b>tick</b> saliva protein antigens. Three cross-tick species conserved genes that encode for Lone Star <b>tick,</b> Amblyomma americanum <b>tick</b> saliva proteins were identified. cDNA regions that code for putative immunogenic regions were spliced together to make a chimeric <b>tick</b> saliva protein.

25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock <b>ticked</b> down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it.

40|$|The southeastern {{lone star}} <b>tick,</b> Amblyomma americanum, has {{recently}} appeared in our field sweeps. This new <b>tick</b> {{in our area}} brings the potential for diseases, such as ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and Southern rash illness borreliosis. Favorable habitats are indicated by excreta of <b>ticks</b> that are already established, with the excreta acting as an assembly pheromone that retains <b>ticks</b> in areas with proper temperature, moisture, and suitable hosts. Our hypothesis is that excreta from different <b>tick</b> species may function as an assembly pheromone for lone star <b>ticks,</b> which may have contributed toward lone star <b>ticks</b> establishing here. Clustering responses by lone star <b>ticks</b> on excreta of <b>ticks</b> from different <b>tick</b> species was tested using six-sector Petri dish attraction bioassays with an added relative humidity component. Dry 33 % RH conditions elicited greater clustering (higher speed, more <b>ticks</b> involved) than under humid 93 % RH, mostly by female adults and nymphs {{and only a few}} larvae.
