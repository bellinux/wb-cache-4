40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} a detailed {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> municipalities and regions with focus on four particular municipalities and one region in a practical part. From the year 2001 to 2015 the share <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes and their development are evaluated as a part of total incomes. The theme is highly topical due to ongoing discussions among lawmakers {{on the subject of}} budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> The law determining the budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> is modified frequently, that is why knowing the impact of changes on particular municipalities or regions is helpful. This knowledge can be useful base for planning new adjustments of budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> In the theoretical part there are mentioned expert opinions on financial management of municipalities and regions that arise from their functions and positions. The emphasis is put on incomes of municipalities and regions, especially on tax incomes. Particular changes from 2001 to 2015 in law regulating budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> are described here with their impacts on municipalities and regions. Incomes and management of selected municipalities representing various size categories and Liberec region are analysed in the practical part. Financial self-sufficiency is evaluated here. In general municipalities are more financial self-sufficient than regions. This thesis is further dealing with individual tax incomes and impacts of changes in budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> on their size. Making models of theoretical incomes is used to simulate effects of diverse law adjustments. Results of the analysis show that <b>tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> municipalities and regions are generally increasing. During the observed period there was tendency to lower the growth <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> large cities, to increase the growth <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> small municipalities and to straighten the level <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> medium municipalities thanks to changes in budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes.</b> <b>Tax</b> incomes <b>of</b> regions were increased thanks to changes in budgetary allocation <b>of</b> <b>taxes</b> despite <b>of</b> partial decrease in particular segments <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> incomes after 2012...|$|R

This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous and honest {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a <b>tax</b> <b>of</b> one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems.
