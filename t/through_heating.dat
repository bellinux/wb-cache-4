25|$|A {{condenser}} is a {{piece of}} apparatus or equipment {{that can be used to}} condense, that is, to change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state; in the laboratory, it is generally used in procedures done with organic liquids brought into gaseous state <b>through</b> <b>heating</b> or application of vacuum (lowered pressure), though processes often involve at least trace amounts of the common inorganic component water, and can involve other inorganic substances as well. Condensers can be applied at various scales, from micro-scale (very few microliters) to process-scale (many liters), using laboratory glassware and occasionally metalware that accomplishes the cooling of the vapor generated by boiling (<b>through</b> <b>heating</b> or application of vacuum).|$|E
25|$|This is an {{experimental}} method that employs {{a number of}} vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located {{at the base of}} the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (<b>through</b> <b>heating)</b> the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD.|$|E
25|$|Reflectors {{can also}} be used to {{selectively}} reduce or eliminate unwanted thermal emission. Incandescent lamps produce light <b>through</b> <b>heating</b> of the filament, while arc lamps produce light through the heating and ionization of a gas. In either case, this heat is also emitted from the lamp as infrared light. The thermal energy is often projected onto the stage with the visible light, and thousands of watts of incandescent lighting can be uncomfortably hot for the actors on stage. Specially designed reflectors are able to absorb and dissipate infrared at the fixture before the visible light reaches the stage.|$|E

25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual polynucleotide strands <b>through</b> <b>heating.</b> Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable Taq polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E
500|$|Coandă's 1910s-era patents {{describe}} the inline piston engine's exhaust gases as being routed <b>through</b> <b>heating</b> channels or heat exchangers {{in contact with}} the central air flow, then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow. The turbo-propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating [...] of thrust. The powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms: a turbine without propellers, turbo-propulseur, ducted fan or a suction turbine.|$|E
2500|$|A {{condenser}} is {{an apparatus}} or {{item of equipment}} used to condense (change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state). In the laboratory, condensers are generally used in procedures involving organic liquids brought into the gaseous state <b>through</b> <b>heating,</b> with or without lowering the pressure (applying vacuum)—though applications in inorganic and other chemistry areas exist. While condensers can be applied at various scales, in the research, training, or discovery laboratory, one most often uses glassware designed to pass a vapor flow over an adjacent cooled chamber. In simplest form, such a condenser consists of a single glass tube with outside air providing cooling. A further simple form, the Liebig-type of condenser, involves concentric glass tubes, an inner one through which the hot gases pass, and an outer, [...] "ported" [...] chamber through which a cooling fluid passes, to reduce the gas temperature in the inner, to afford the condensation.|$|E

2500|$|To {{some extent}} the Rashaida {{alleviate}} these discrepancies by processing milk {{that is not}} needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into storable products. Unprocessed camel milk remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into {{two different types of}} product with practically unlimited [...] "shelf-life" [...] by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. <b>Through</b> <b>heating,</b> zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as cooking fat or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The other milk product described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun-dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed.|$|E

In this work, simple-to-use equations, which are easier than currently available models and involve a fewer number of fitted parameters, requiring less complicated and shorter computations, are formulated to arrive at an appropriate prediction of maximum shell-side vapour velocities <b>through</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers for wide range of conditions {{as a function of}} molecular weight and pressure. The proposed fitted equations accurately estimate the maximum shell-side vapour velocities <b>through</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers for pressures up to 7500 kPa(abs), and molecular weights up to 400. The values calculated here are maximum for reasonable operation. In order to reduce pressure drop, velocities must be well below the maximum values. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 3. 9 %. The fitted equations developed in this study can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the maximum shell-side vapour velocities <b>through</b> <b>heat</b> exchangers at wide range of conditions without opting for any experimental measurements. In particular, chemical and process engineers would find the simple equations to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|R
