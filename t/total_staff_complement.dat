40|$|Natural science {{collections}} are accepted globally as critical research assets. A total of 71 zoological collections in South Africa, consisting of over 15 million specimens housed at 22 institutions, were assessed {{to determine their}} current status and to make recommendations for their future security. The two greatest challenges to the sustainability of the {{collections are}} (1) that natural science museums report to departments with an arts and culture rather than a science mandate and (2) staffing. The <b>total</b> <b>staff</b> <b>complement</b> within these 22 institutions is 115, with many collections understaffed or not staffed, {{and the loss of}} a single staff member often leaves a collection neglected and unused. Consolidation of collections so that there is a critical mass of staff is essential to address understaffing and would also allow {{for the establishment of a}} more dynamic research and curation environment. Consolidation under an appropriate department would also enable concentration of resources rather than dilution across all institutions, which would improve the storage environment (currently 28 %of collections have reliable temperature control and only 8 % (five collections) have humidity control), and increase the efficiency of the use of available funds (the curation budget was R 1. 08 million in 2009 / 2010 for all 71 collections).

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Public Relations Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 2004 This {{research}} paper {{is aimed at}} formulating a corporate communication strategy for a medium- sized organisation, Highbury Solutions, operating in the computer software ' industry.

Highbury Solutions had a tumover of approximately R 25 million over the past financial year (2004).

This strategy will be based on sound research principles of both the organisation and its stakeholders and will be based on the model for Corporate Communication Strategy in Steyn & Puth (2002 : 62).

40|$|Objectives: No {{research}} data exists on forensic psychiatric service {{provision in the}} Eastern Cape, Republic of South Africa. The objective {{of this research was}} to assess current forensic psychiatric service provision and utilisation rates at Fort England Hospital. This is important in improving and strengthening the service. A related objective was to develop a model for a provincial prison mental health service. Methodology: This study is a situational analysis of an existing forensic psychiatric service in the Eastern Cape. The design of the study was cross sectional. An audit questionnaire was utilised to collate quantitative data, which was submitted to Fort England Hospital, Grahamstown. A proposed prison mental health service was developed utilising prevalence rates of mental illness among prisoners to calculate bed and staff requirements for an ambulatory and in-patient service. Results: During the study period a total of 403 remand detainees were admitted to the forensic psychiatry division of Fort England Hospital. The average length of stay was 494 days and the bed utilisation rate was determined at 203. 54 %. We estimate that to provide a provincial prison mental health service to treat psychotic illnesses and major depression the province requires a 52 bedded facility and a <b>total</b> <b>staff</b> <b>complement</b> of approximately 31. Conclusions: Forensic psychiatric services include the assessment, management and treatment of mentally disordered persons in conflict with the law and prisoners requiring psychiatric assessments. The Eastern Cape Province does not have plans or policies to assess and manage mentally ill offenders, resulting in an increased load on available services. We recommend that an inter-departmental task team, which includes Health, Justice and Constitutional Development and Correctional Services, should be established in the province, to develop a strategy to assist in the development of an effective and efficient forensic psychiatric service. This should be driven by the provincial Department of Health...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (DTech (Public Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008. The {{research}} investigates {{trends in}} the employment of people with disabilities within the Provincial Government of the Western Cape (PGWC) and develops a normative model to address the matter of low employment and progression rates of people with disabilities within the PGWC. The advent of democracy in 1994 in South Africa witnessed the enshrinement of the fundamental human rights of all citizens, particularly within previously disadvantaged groups. Yet, in spite of rights being legislated for people with disabilities, such people within the public service represented only 0. 15 % of the <b>total</b> <b>staff</b> <b>complement</b> of the public service nationwide, as at December 2004, compared to the 2 % target legislated in 1995. The research examines a philosophical and theoretical approach to managing the employment and retention of people with disabilities within the public service in Chapter Two, before providing a synopsis of the existing constitutional and legislative framework that supports access to employment for people with disabilities. The subsequent Chapters examine {{trends in the}} employment of people with disabilities within the PGWC, in conjunction with a situational analysis of disability in South Africa. The recruitment and selection practices within the PGWC are then examined in order to determine whether specific disability actions have been incorporated into the documentation. Finally, key recommendations follow a description of the research methodology and the presentation of the most salient findings of the study. The proposed normative model incorporates eight sets of criteria jointly derived from the literature and the empirical survey. The sets of criteria must be put in place for the achievement of a sustained increase {{in the employment of}} people with disabilities. The findings on disability employment in the PGWC are generalised to the remaining eight provinces in the country on the basis that the same policy and procedure documents are regulatory in all nine provinces...|$|E
