5|$|The men at <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River {{settlement}} waited {{overnight and}} then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode. He ordered a militia {{party to the}} settlement to secure the it {{and make sure the}} attackers were dealt with accordingly. When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of bullet holes from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
5|$|Many {{trees have}} flowers rich in nectar which are {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas {{of the developing world}} where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus spp.) can be candied. Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
5|$|Thomson {{suggested}} that atoms were divisible, {{and that the}} corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> pudding model as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, <b>the</b> <b>Plummer</b> House {{was moved}} to the grounds of the Leonis Adobe Museum. <b>The</b> <b>Plummer</b> House was built in 1874 in Plummer Park, West Hollywood. It was known as the [...] "Oldest House in Hollywood" [...] and was {{designated}} as a California Historic Landmark #160 in 1935. It fell into disrepair and was the victim of vandalism and fires. The Leonis Adobe Association in conjunction with the Los Angeles Conservancy arranged with the county to move the front part of <b>the</b> <b>Plummer</b> House to its current location on the Leonis Adobe grounds. <b>The</b> <b>Plummer</b> House has been restored and is used as the visitor center and gift shop for the Leonis Adobe Museum.|$|R

5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the wall {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Plum</b> River raid was a bloodless {{skirmish}} {{that occurred}} at present-day Savanna, Illinois, on May 21, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. Most of the settlement's inhabitants, except for a few defenders, had fled for Galena, Illinois, before the raid happened. A small band of Native Americans, either Sauk or Fox, attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present. The men who were present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour, after which the attackers withdrew. No one was killed or injured during the attack, but in its aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to Savanna. They returned to Galena without incident and the settlement at Savanna was temporarily abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} European forts and settlements {{were established}} by traders {{beginning in the}} 1680s. Almost none of these ephemeral early historical sites have been located archaeologically. Julien Dubuque’s Mines of Spain settlement and adjacent Meskwaki village occupied in the late 18th century and early 19th century, {{has been the subject}} of numerous archaeological surveys. Fort Madison (1808–1813), the first American settlement and the first American fort in Iowa, was partially excavated in 1965. American settlement began in earnest in the 1830s, and the official removal of American Indians from Iowa was completed by 1852. Several of these historical sites have been excavated, including Gilbert’s Trading Post. and Fort Atkinson. Archaeologists have also studied historical American settlements, including excavations at <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> Grove Historic House, the Buxton African-American community, and the Bowen’s Prairie community.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and Horseshoe Bend {{was filled with}} war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. In {{the week before the}} Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Colonel Henry Dodge of the western Michigan Territory militia was busy {{responding}} to various incidents across the region. On the afternoon of June 8, 1832, Dodge and his men, including James W. Stephenson, proceeded to Kellogg's Grove and buried the victims of the St. Vrain massacre. That night Stephenson returned to Galena, Illinois, while Dodge moved to Hickory Point where he remained overnight. The next morning Dodge set out for Dixon's Ferry, where he camped with General Hugh Brady.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and the Battle of Apple River Fort {{was filled with}} war-related {{activity}} and events. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. The week preceding the Battle of Apple River Fort was an important turning point for the militia: between June 16–18 two key battles, one at Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bend, {{played a key role}} in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt {{only served}} as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County {{for about three}} months because, in November, Democrat Shibell ran for {{re-election}} against Republican challenger Bob Paul. The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win. Republican Wyatt expected he would continue in the job. Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing, everyone expected {{that it would be}} split off into its own county soon with Tombstone as its seat. Wyatt hoped to win the job as the new county sheriff and continue receiving <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> 10% of all tax moneys collected. Southern Pacific was the major landholder, so tax collection was a relatively easy process.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound {{was filled with}} war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. The week before the Battle of Apple River Fort (on June 24) was an {{important}} turning point for the settlers: between June 16 and 18 two key battles, one at Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bend, {{played a role in}} changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run. The Battle of Apple River Fort occurred five days before the Sinsinawa Mound raid; the fight was a 45-minute gun battle between defenders garrisoned inside Apple River Fort and Sauk and Fox warriors led by Chief Black Hawk himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of <b>the</b> <b>Plum</b> River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick it out on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plum</b> blossom, {{which is}} known as the meihua (梅花), {{is one of the most}} beloved flowers in China and has been {{frequently}} depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries. <b>The</b> <b>plum</b> blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring. The blossoms are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, exuding an ethereal elegance, while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life. In Confucianism, <b>the</b> <b>plum</b> blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue. More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.|$|E

Thomas. The second wing was added in 1936 when additional financing was made available. The town continued to grow rapidly over the following decades, resulting {{the construction of the}} adjacent school buildings and the eventual conversion of this building to a junior high school.
