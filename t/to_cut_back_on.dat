When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981.

He decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the club's youth coaching spending, {{and as a result}} Wrexham's youth structure was downgraded from an Academy to a Centre of Excellence. He signed goalkeeper Marius Røvde, midfielder Jim Whitley, and gave striker Hector Sam his debut, but failed to keep Wrexham away from the relegation zone. With relegation confirmed, new signing Lee Jones scored all five goals in a 5–0 win over Cambridge United, leaving cause for optimism at the Racecourse Ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. <b>To</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E

5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the gifts {{given to the}} Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of}} the relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E

Second, if an individual bank undertakes excessively risky investments and suffers high losses as a consequence, it {{will be forced to}} recapitalize substantially.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new requirement for bank capital: banking-on-the-average rules. Under these rules a bank’s required level of equity capital is monotonically increasing in the realized equity capital of its peers. In a simple model we illustrate the workings of banking-on-the-average rules. We show that in booms these rules can prevent banks from taking excessive risks. Moreover, they alleviate the socially harmful procyclicality of conventional equity-capital rules, which may induce banks <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> excessively <b>on</b> lending. Finally, we argue that under these rules prudent banks can impose prudency on other banks. In addition, banking-on-the-average rules ensure the build-up of bank equity capital in booms and thus avoid excessive leverage. banking crisis; banking on the average; banking system; equity-capital requirements...|$|R
