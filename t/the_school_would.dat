5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Schwester Selma {{founded the}} Shaare Zedek Nursing School. The idea was {{initially}} opposed by Dr. Wallach, who worried that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> emphasize theory over practical nursing, but Schwester Selma's curriculum proved him wrong. Examinations following the three-year {{course of study}} were administered by doctors from the British government hospital in Jerusalem. Schwester Selma taught all the practical nursing classes in the school's early years. After her death, the school instituted a Schwester Selma Award, which is bestowed on each year's outstanding graduate.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 Glenn {{helped found}} the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at Ohio State University to {{encourage}} public service. On July 22, 2006, the institute merged with OSU's School of Public Policy and Management to become the John Glenn School of Public Affairs; Glenn held an adjunct professorship at the school. In February 2015, {{it was announced that}} <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> become the John Glenn College of Public Affairs in April.|$|E
50|$|On June 8, 2007, it was {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> discontinue <b>the</b> regular-season series.|$|R
50|$|On December 8, 1926, <b>the</b> two <b>school</b> presidents {{agreed to}} {{temporarily}} suspend athletic relations between <b>the</b> <b>schools.</b> <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> not compete {{against each other}} in any athletic event for the next four years. Baylor and Texas A&M would not meet in football again until 1931.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be {{inspected}} by Her Majesty's Inspectors of <b>Schools,</b> <b>would</b> have {{one third of}} their governing bodies appointed by the LEA, and would require {{the approval of the}} Secretary of State to raise fees or carry out building work.|$|R
5|$|Overall, the Dartmouth {{football}} program went 23–23–2 in Wurtenburg's {{five years of}} coaching. The 1898 season was the final Triangular Football League championship <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> win; the conference would become defunct in 1901, two years later. Following Wurtenburg's departure, Frederick E. Jennings, a player under Wurtenburg, would take over the program, leading it to a 2–4–2 record in one year of coaching. Another former player, Walter McCornack would coach the program starting in 1901, and led the team to a 15-win record in two years. Wurtenburg's tenure as coach has occasionally been remarked {{as the beginning of}} Dartmouth's acceptance as a major team.|$|E
5|$|The 1879 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1879 college football season. The team {{was the first}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as it was entirely student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played just a single game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> not have another football squad until 1882.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 season brought Navy's overall win–loss {{record to}} an even 3–3–1. It also brought the Academy's record against Johns Hopkins to 2–2 tie. The season {{marked the first time}} a team for the Naval Academy would play a multiple-game season. In 1886, their {{schedule}} was expanded from three games to five, and continued to grow through subsequent years. It was the worst single-season record for the Academy until 1888, when they went 1–4. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
50|$|Southwest Baptist {{rejoined the}} MIAA in {{football}} for the 2013 football season, {{which meant that}} <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> then play an 11-game conference football schedule with no non-conference games.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} that Ryde <b>School</b> <b>would</b> continue to run Bembridge as a separate unit, although the successful Dyslexia Department and <b>the</b> Pre-Prep <b>School</b> <b>would</b> cease to function, and <b>the</b> Junior <b>school</b> <b>would</b> no longer operate as a separate entity. By {{the end of the}} term, many parents had withdrawn their children.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, {{with the}} end of the shuttle program and the {{subsequent}} loss of jobs in the area, officials have been concerned that a quarter of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> fall below 70% enrollment capacity.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at <b>the</b> <b>school,</b> <b>would</b> be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|A strict {{conflict}} of interest policy was enacted, and researchers were {{forced to choose between}} the two entities; the initial investors had all kept their faculty jobs, and most returned to them. After the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out {{all but one of the}} original investors and paid them each back their original $100. Robinson left EES and became president and CEO of the new company, which was renamed Scientific Atlanta. Boyd stayed on as a member of the board of directors; Robinson's friend Larry Clayton, previously involved in Robinson's radio business and now having graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in physics, became the head of the new company's research and development. Years later, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> promote Scientific Atlanta's origins at Georgia Tech, and Scientific Atlanta has been a longtime financial contributor to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into a mental health institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> two <b>schools</b> federated in January 2011 {{to become}} a Converter Academy. [...] In Spring 2011, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> work together as one school due to Clarendon House being under-subscribed and Chatham House being over-subscribed.|$|R
50|$|In July 2014 it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be split from Barnfield College to form their own multi-academy trust. The college would then focus on further and higher education provision. In 2015 <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> split from Barnfield and formed the Shared Learning Trust.|$|R
5000|$|Outside the Senate, <b>the</b> Catholic <b>schools</b> {{threatened}} {{to close down}} if the bill was passed; Recto countered that if that happened, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be nationalized. Recto {{did not believe the}} threat, stating that <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> were too profitable to be closed. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> gave up <b>the</b> threat, but {{threatened to}} [...] "punish" [...] legislators in favor of the law in future elections. A compromise was suggested, to use the expurgated version; Recto, who had supported the required reading of the unexpurgated version, declared: [...] "The people who would eliminate the books of Rizal from <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> blot out from our minds the memory of the national hero. This is not a fight against Recto but a fight against Rizal", adding that since Rizal is dead, they are attempting to suppress his memory.|$|R
5|$|The Midshipmen's {{loss was}} the first in school history, and ended the team's shutout streak at two seasons. The Naval Academy would not get another shutout until the 1886 season, when they {{defeated}} Johns Hopkins 6–0. The 1883 season continued a seven-season, eight-game long rivalry with Johns Hopkins, which Navy would win, five games to four. The 1883 game {{was the first}} win for Johns Hopkins, which had officially started playing football in 1881. 1883 is considered to be the first season played by the Naval Academy, according to the school athletic department. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. <b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
5|$|By August, the {{prospect}} of Alabama fielding a football team for the 1943 season was in doubt. On August 17, coach Thomas spoke to a civic group in Birmingham and stated {{he did not think}} <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> field a team in 1943 due to the unwillingness of the Army to change their policy that prohibited their cadets from participating in intercollegiate athletics. On August 23, 1943, the University Physical Education and Athletics Committee officially canceled the 1943 season. The decision was made at that time because only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad. As the season was canceled, coach Thomas spent his time leading war bond drives and serving as president of the Tuscaloosa Exchange Club during the time the season was originally scheduled. The cancellation marked only the third time since 1892 that Alabama did not field a football team. The only other seasons the Crimson Tide did not field teams were in 1898 due to University policy that prohibited athletic teams from traveling off campus to compete and again in 1918 due to the effects of World War I.|$|E
5|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, the John Herron Art Institute placed an {{emphasis}} on professionalism and growth in collections. Wilbur Peat, director of the museum from 1929 until 1965, acquired significant portions of the collection. Peat also made connections with benefactors such as Dr. George H. A. Clowes, Booth Tarkington, and Eli Lilly. Caroline Marmon Fesler, president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, gave a number of artworks in the 1940s, including 20th-century modern artworks and Post-Impressionist works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Seurat. After years of debate surrounding expansion and relocation of the museum and school, the great grandchildren of Eli Lilly, J.K. Lilly III and Ruth Lilly, donated the family estate, Oldfields, to the Art Association of Indianapolis in 1966. One year later {{it was decided that}} <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> become a part of Indiana University's Indianapolis campus in an effort to assist with accreditation. That same year it was confirmed that the museum would relocate to Oldfields, with the new Krannert Pavilion opening to the public in October 1970. In 1969, prior to moving to the new site, the Art Association of Indianapolis officially changed its name to the Indianapolis Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the {{ministry}} of education in Quebec ordered unlicensed private evangelical Christian schools to start teaching evolution and sexual education, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be closed. In Ontario, private schools {{are not required to}} teach either evolution or sex education.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, the Cal-UCLA rivalry {{was played}} on [...] "Cal Week". During the same week, UCLA and Cal would play {{each other in}} the other sports in season, and <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> host festivals celebrating the {{achievements}} of the UC System.|$|R
50|$|In 1770 Pergen {{was mainly}} {{responsible}} for education reform, {{under which the}} state itself should take responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>school</b> system. In contrast the clergy would lose its role in teaching and be replaced by laity, or at least secular priests. In addition, most subjects in <b>the</b> secondary <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be taught in German. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> develop curricula, and teacher training should be established. This would be financed from an endowment fund. This was anti-clerical and represented the reforms of the Enlightenment, which proved difficult to implement {{in the face of}} resistance from Maria Theresa and conservative-minded circles in the court.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} be {{absorbed by the}} Rinzai school later in the Song. The lineage still lives on to this day through Chan Master Hsu Yun (1840–1959).|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} that from 1993 <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> admit both genders. The last all girl year group left in 1997 and the school was renamed to Chamberlayne Park Secondary School after the Chamberlayne family who donated the land for the school to be built on.|$|E
25|$|The Chaplain School ceased {{activities}} in Newport August 21, 2009 for its move to Fort Jackson, and its name was changed on October 1, 2009 to the Naval Chaplaincy School and Center (NCSC), {{to reflect the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> no longer only train chaplains, but would now include training for Religious Program Specialists, as well.|$|E
50|$|In 2016 {{enrollment}} at Jenner {{was down}} to 239. In August of that year the discussions on how to merge <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> resumed, and in December of that year CPS confirmed {{that the process of}} merging <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> begin. <b>The</b> merger would take place at least in <b>the</b> 2018-2019 <b>school</b> year.|$|R
50|$|On May 15, 300 police officers, {{including}} at least 60 in plainclothes, cordoned off <b>the</b> <b>school</b> (making five arrests), effectively breaking the parent blockade and allowing the teachers to return. The city's Board of Education and the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board both announced {{on the same day}} that <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> close.|$|R
50|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>school's</b> songs <b>would</b> be sung in {{important}} ceremony.|$|R
25|$|The town's Parish Church {{was used}} as the first school house. Until 1893, Lanark Grammar was a fee-paying school and until 1884 it was for boys only. From its {{beginnings}} in the Parish Church, <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> usually have only two teachers at a time until 1884. The only recorded exception to this was in the 1770s when Robert Thomson is reported to have a second assistant.|$|E
25|$|King's Ely {{also has}} many sports facilities, {{including}} an artificial turf pitch, swimming pool, tennis courts, sports hall and several outdoor pitches. In June 2002, the Principal Richard Youdale aroused media interest and criticism with an announcement that <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>would</b> be phasing out rugby. The school reinstated {{the sport in}} 2005. The Principal, Richard Youdale cited, among other reasons, the increasing popularity of football.|$|E
25|$|St. Michael's School was {{a private}} Catholic primary school that serves grades 1 through 8 as well as kindergarten. The {{original}} building was built around 1918, when the school was founded, and the school was administered by Saint Michael's Catholic Parish. The school was in the former Hudson Catholic High School building. In May 2011 the church announced <b>the</b> <b>School</b> <b>would</b> close {{at the end of}} the school year; it has since been closed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> area primary <b>schools</b> <b>would</b> be Lockport Lower and Lockport Upper Elementary Schools in Lockport, and {{the area}} junior high school is Lockport Middle <b>School</b> in Lockport.. <b>The</b> area high <b>school</b> <b>would</b> be Central Lafourche High School.|$|R
50|$|In 1980 the {{decision}} was made to merge both <b>schools</b> and <b>the</b> name changed to Purcell Marian High School. Purcell High School and Marian High School merged beginning with <b>the</b> 1981-82 <b>school</b> year. <b>The</b> name of <b>the</b> new <b>school</b> <b>would</b> be Purcell Marian High <b>School.</b> It <b>would</b> be located at the Purcell site and begin with <b>the</b> 1981-82 <b>school</b> year. <b>The</b> mascot <b>would</b> be the Cavalier, and <b>the</b> <b>school's</b> colors <b>would</b> be Crimson, Blue and Gold.|$|R
