5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Fischer and Born, 2009, {{previous}} knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks {{that would have to}} be replicated at a later time. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A control group was not given any knowledge of a reward. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.|$|E

40|$|Among {{philosophical}} {{approaches to}} <b>the</b> notion of <b>subject,</b> {{at least three}} main historical stages may be distinguished: at the metaphysical stage, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> that of a substance; at the transcendental stage (Kant and Fichte), <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> viewed as a unifying polarity of horizons; at the psychoanalytical stage, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> defined as a gap structure. <b>The</b> transcendental <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> a structure for the world, whereas <b>the</b> psychoanalytical <b>subject</b> {{needs to have a}} structure in itself to structure its own ontological lack.

25|$|What {{made this}} trial novel was that <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> {{randomly}} allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, {{based on the}} order in which they presented for treatment. This practice could be biased, because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).|$|E
25|$|In {{the study}} How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (2010) the {{researchers}} criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate {{for the study}} of cognitive dissonance.

That there are other reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> indifferent between choices.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each school could offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects.

25|$|Considered to be {{a mental}} {{workspace}} enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E

Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Adriaen Brouwer (1605 or 1606–1638) {{typically}} painted small {{scenes of}} ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour.
