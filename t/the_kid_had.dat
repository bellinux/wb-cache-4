2500|$|On March 1, 1879, after {{previous}} {{efforts to}} restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty, Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with the Kid, who had witnessed {{the murder of a}} Lincoln County lawyer named Chapman. Wallace wanted the Kid to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> killed others and wanted Wallace's protection from the outlaw gang and amnesty for his crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for the Kid to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds." [...] On March 20, the Kid agreed to testify against others involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for the Kid's arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. After the Kid testified in court on April 14, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. The Kid escaped from jail and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. The Kid was shot and killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|E

5000|$|He overhears Tonia tell Sandridge {{that she}} heard <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> was in <b>the</b> area, {{and that she}} assumes <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> will visit her soon. She says she will send Sandridge word of <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> {{whereabouts}} by Gregorio, [...] "the small son of old Luisa," [...] in time for Sandridge to ride off with a posse, find <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> and kill him. Sandridge departs and shortly <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> appears, pretending he <b>has</b> just arrived. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> {{sends a message to}} Sandridge through Domingo Sales, who claims that Gregorio is [...] "too ill of a fever to ride". The message says that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>has</b> arrived and explains that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>has</b> exchanged clothes with Tonia to foil pursuers. Sandridge returns to Tonia's home and sees two figures in the moonlight: one in men's clothing and the other in women's. The one in men's clothing rides away. Assuming this to be Tonia, Sandridge ambushes and shoots the remaining figure. The victim is Tonia, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>having</b> tricked Sandridge into killing his girlfriend.|$|R
60|$|One night, {{many weeks}} later, Malemute Kid and Prince fell to solving chess {{problems}} from the torn page {{of an ancient}} magazine. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> just returned from his Bonanza properties and was resting up preparatory to a long moose hunt.|$|E
60|$|But in {{this affair}} <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> not felt the grim thirst for {{encounter}} that usually urged him on to battle. It {{had been a}} purely chance row, born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> rather liked the slim, haughty, brown-faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood. And now he wanted no more blood. He {{wanted to get away}} and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face. Even a Mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood.|$|E

60|$|Freddie, {{dear old}} chap, was rather slow at getting {{on to the}} fine points of the idea. When I appeared, {{carrying}} the kid, and dumped him down in our sitting-room, he didn't absolutely effervesce with joy, {{if you know what}} I mean. <b>The</b> <b>kid</b> <b>had</b> started to bellow by this time, and poor old Freddie seemed to find it rather trying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I own I {{was badly}} rattled. You see, if <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>had</b> not held fast, I'd have gone {{right down the}} rock face and don't know where I'd have stopped. Perhaps it's strange, but I remembered I'd got five hundred dollars of his and the thing bothered me. To know I'd played a {{straight}} game didn't comfort me much." ...|$|E
60|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> grown {{large enough}} to knock out his father he had been {{compelled}} to learn the plumber's art. So now back to this honorable and useful profession he returned. But it was as an assistant that he engaged himself; {{and it is the}} master plumber and not the assistant, who wears diamonds as large as hailstones and looks contemptuously upon the marble colonnades of Senator Clark's mansion.|$|E

60|$|The {{shepherd}} {{could hardly}} believe his eyes {{when he returned from}} seeking the sheep and found that <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>had</b> vanished. He was afraid to go home and tell the same tale that he had told yesterday; so he searched the wood through and through till night was nearly come. Then he felt that there was no help for it, and he must go home and confess to his master.|$|E
60|$|Nor was he wrong. Tarzan {{pushed him}} roughly into the cage, {{and in another}} moment Rabba Kega understood. Cold sweat broke from every pore of his body--he trembled as with ague--for the ape-man was binding him {{securely}} in the very spot <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>had</b> previously occupied. The witch-doctor pleaded, first for his life, and then for a death less cruel; but {{he might as well}} have saved his pleas for Numa, since already they were directed toward a wild beast who understood no word of what he said.|$|E
60|$|The promptitude and {{despatch}} {{with which}} <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> attended to the gentleman with the black-jack {{had not been}} without {{its effect on the}} followers of the stricken one. Physical courage is not an outstanding quality of the New York gangsman. His personal preference is for retreat when {{it is a question of}} unpleasantness with a stranger. And, in any case, even when warring among themselves, the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks of hand-to-hand fighting. Their chosen method of battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot.|$|E

5000|$|Round 2 This round varies but {{comes in}} the form of a {{physical}} challenge. E.g., <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> to paint How Clean is Your House? star Kim Woodburn, or guess the songs performed by <b>the</b> What Do <b>Kids</b> Know? mini maestros ...|$|R
60|$|With the {{springing}} roan {{under him}} he felt little care or uneasiness. After a five-mile gallop he drew {{in to the}} plainsman's jogging trot, and rode northeastward toward the Nueces River bottoms. He knew the country well--its most tortuous and obscure trails through the great wilderness of brush and pear, and its camps and lonesome ranches where one might find safe entertainment. Always he bore to the east; for <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> never seen the ocean, {{and he had a}} fancy to lay his hand upon the mane of the great Gulf, the gamesome colt of the greater waters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on! We gotta get him," [...] he cried, as he {{ran from}} the barn after the fugitive. The others, all but Dopey Charlie, {{followed}} {{in the wake of}} their leader. The wounded man, his audience departed, ceased screaming and, sitting up, fell to examining himself. To his surprise he discovered that he was not dead. A further and more minute examination disclosed the additional fact that he was not even badly wounded. The bullet of <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> merely creased the flesh over the ribs beneath his right arm. With a grunt that might have been either disgust or relief he stumbled to his feet and joined in the pursuit.|$|E
60|$|The promptitude and {{despatch}} {{with which}} <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> attended to the gentleman with the black-jack {{had not been}} without {{its effect on the}} followers of the stricken one. Physical courage is not an outstanding quality of the New York hooligan. His personal preference is for retreat when {{it is a question of}} unpleasantness with a stranger. And, in any case, even when warring among themselves, the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks of hand-to-hand fighting. Their chosen method of battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot. This is more suited to their physique, which is rarely great. The gangsman, as a rule, is stunted and slight of build.|$|E

6000|$|... "It hasn't {{given him}} much {{excitement}} so far, poor chap," [...] said Billy Windsor. [...] "He's {{in the championship}} class, and here he has been pottering about New York for a month {{without being able to}} get a fight. It's always the way in this rotten East," [...] continued Billy, warming up as was his custom when discussing a case of oppression and injustice. [...] "It's all graft here. You've got to let half a dozen brutes dip into every dollar you earn, or you don't get a chance. If <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>had</b> a manager, he'd get all the fights he wanted. And the manager would get nearly all the money. I've told him that we will back him up." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had only}} whistled {{a few bars}} of [...] "My Little Irish Rose," [...] and had barely got into {{the first page of}} his story of life on the prairie, when Kid Brady appeared. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> come to pay a {{farewell}} visit. He had not yet begun training, and he was making the best of the short time before such comforts should be forbidden by smoking a big black cigar. Master Maloney eyed him admiringly. The Kid, unknown to that gentleman himself, was Pugsy's ideal. He came from the Plains, and had, indeed, once actually been a cowboy; he was a coming champion; and he could smoke big black cigars. There was no trace of his official well-what-is-it-now? air about Pugsy as he laid down his book and prepared to converse.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} in old Justo Valdos's gambling house. There was a poker game at which sat {{players who were}} not all friends, as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot Folly as she gallops. There was a row over so small a matter {{as a pair of}} queens; and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>had</b> committed an indiscretion, and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder. For, the unfortunate combatant, instead of being a Greaser, was a high-blooded youth from the cow ranches, of about the Kid's own age and possessed of friends and champions. His blunder in missing the Kid's right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman.|$|E

50|$|The {{first round}} {{was a test}} of knowledge. Host Clark asked <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> a series of {{multiple}} choice questions. <b>The</b> <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> 10 seconds to lock in their answers on a keypad in front of them. After 10 seconds, Clark revealed the correct answer and the home audience saw percentages of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> who correctly answered the question {{and those who did}} not.|$|R
50|$|As of March 2015, <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>has</b> {{earned a}} rare 100% perfect rating on film review {{aggregate}} website Rotten Tomatoes and an 8.4 user rating on the Internet Movie Database, placing it at number 95 {{on the latter}} site's Top 250 Titles.|$|R
