5|$|Travers also {{visited the}} home of Thomas Crozier, hoping to meet with him, but the latter {{did not come to}} <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> {{presently}} resides near Craigavon. James McDowell lives in Lurgan, and John James Somerville became an evangelical minister in Belfast. The UVF had cut all ties with Somerville after he had opposed the 1994 ceasefire. In January 2015 he was found dead in his Shankill Road flat. Aged 70, he died of cancer of the kidney.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Sally Sparrow enters Wester Drumlins, an {{abandoned}} house, {{to look for}} subjects to photograph. Instead she finds eerie statues and {{a message from the}} Doctor behind peeling wallpaper addressed to her, warning her about the Weeping Angels. Sally returns the next day with her friend Kathy Nightingale to explore further but Kathy disappears {{at the same time a}} young man knocks at <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> claims to be Kathy's grandson and delivers a letter to Sally. The letter, written by Kathy, explains that she suddenly found herself in the 1920s in Hull. She settled down with a husband and led a peaceful life and requests that Sally tell Kathy's brother Larry of her disappearance. Sally sees a Yale key hanging from the hand of one of the statues and takes it before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> stares at the thin slot and grins.|$|E

5|$|The final {{enemy is}} Lorenzo, {{who seemed to}} be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several {{different}} forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1876, Hickok {{was playing}} poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened {{up at the}} table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok {{encouraged}} McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Though McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted. The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat {{with his back to}} a wall so he could see the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him twice, but Rich refused.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} ceremony the candidate, often a ploughboy, {{was told to}} come to the barn where the ceremonial procedures were to take place, normally held between 11pm and 1 am. Once at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>he</b> was blindfolded and taken before the master of ceremonies, who was often an elder ploughman. As in Masonic rituals there was then a prearranged and established exchange of questions and answers that was to be given. In the case of the Horseman's Word and the Miller's Word this exchange was often a parody of catechism. After this was completed the inductee was then asked to seal the pact and shake hands with the devil, which would often be a branch or pole covered in animal fur.|$|E

25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E
25|$|The given probabilities {{depend on}} {{specific}} assumptions {{about how the}} host and contestant choose their doors. A key insight is that, under these standard conditions, there is more information about doors 2 and 3 that was not available {{at the beginning of}} the game, when the door 1 was chosen by the player: the host's deliberate action adds value to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>he</b> did not choose to eliminate, but not to the one chosen by the contestant originally. Another insight is that switching doors is a different action than choosing between the two remaining doors at random, as the first action uses the previous information and the latter does not. Other possible behaviors than the one described can reveal different additional information, or none at all, and yield different probabilities.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
50|$|Alexander VII died in 1667 and was memorialised in a {{spectacular}} tomb by Bernini. It {{is famous for}} the skeleton holding a gilded hourglass, just above <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>He</b> was succeeded by Pope Clement IX (1667-69).|$|R

25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{continued to}} escalate as a superior {{court ruled that}} neither Alonzo or Robertson should be seated until situation was resolved. They then forwarded {{the case to the}} Indiana Supreme Court who ruled in favor of Robertson. On the morning of February 24, Robertson entered the Senate chamber to take his seat, but as soon as he walked through <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> was attacked by several Democratic Senators who rushed him and beat him to the floor. The Senate leader ordered him removed from the chamber by guards, who then locked him out. The Republicans immediately went wild, attacking their nearest Democrat. The fight continued for several minutes until one Democrat pulled a gun and fired it into the ceiling threatening to start killing Republicans, ending the fight but making the rest of the building aware of it. The brawl soon spread to the House of Representatives and throughout the building as Republicans began to attack Democrats. Unlike the Senate, the rest of the building had a strong Republican majority, and the Democrats were soon overwhelmed. Six-hundred Republicans then beat down the door of the Senate Chamber and dragged out the Democratic Senators, threatening to kill them. Gray ordered police and other officials to break up the fight, which ended after nearly a full four hours of fighting.|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 am on {{the morning}} of June 21, 1957, Fisher {{answered}} {{a knock on the door}} to his room, Room 839. Upon opening <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> was confronted by FBI agents who addressed him as [...] "colonel" [...] and stated that they had [...] "information concerning [...] involvement in espionage." [...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the {{inscription}} over <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> believes that they used caves as a Dionysian oracular temple, based upon Dashwood’s reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais. [...] Sir Nathaniel Wraxall in his Historical Memoires (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay. Gerald Gardner and others such as Mike Howard say the Monks worshipped [...] "the Goddess". Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself {{and even if the}} underground version followed its public model precisely.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding {{the back door of the}} house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{wakes up}} in a cell in the , where Juliet gently interrogates him. [...] At one point Jack attacks her and {{attempts}} to escape, holding an improvised weapon at her throat.

[...] Jack throws Juliet away, and then opens the door. As Ben dashes back through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>he</b> came in, water starts rushing into the hallway. [...] Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to push a button which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies. [...] He does so and she knocks him unconscious. When he awakes, she shows Jack a file which she says contains documents about his entire life. [...] Juliet asks Jack if he has any questions about Sarah. [...] After a pause, he asks, [...] "Is she happy?" [...] Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done.|$|E

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>he</b> opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall with dark hair. The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>He</b> then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she leans against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E
