Along with this, two chapters were released prior to the book's launch: one was put on Riordan's website and another read out by Riordan on Percy's birthday, August 18.|$|E

In March 2005, during a local radio show, Wang apologized on air to the Beijing public for an ongoing natural gas supply shortage in the city. The action won praise {{in the media and}} was said to have decreased the perceived distance between government officials and the public. Wang was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> and responsible.|$|E
50|$|Some Romans {{at least}} did {{consider}} the Chamavi <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Franks.</b> On the Peutinger map, which dates to {{as early as}} the 4th century, is a brief note written in the space north of the Rhine, generally interpreted as Hamavi qui et Pranci which is translated as The Hamavi, who <b>are</b> <b>Franks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of parts of present-day Upper and Middle Franconia, who were not {{under the control of}} Würzburg, probably also considered themselves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Franks</b> at that time, and certainly their dialect distinguished them from {{the inhabitants}} of Bavaria and Swabia.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Hammerschmidt {{continues}} to investigate Zoe's death, and is given information {{by an unknown}} leaker within the White House. Major document dumps are made available to Hammerschmidt, which, among other charges, prompts an impeachment hearing against Frank. In response, the Underwoods set up extensive surveillance on all White House personnel. Eventually, the leaker makes a voice-modulated call to Hammerschmidt, implicating Doug in Zoe's murder. The Underwoods convince Doug to take the fall for killing Zoe, and the leaker is revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Frank</b> himself.|$|E
25|$|Cooper and the FBI {{surround}} Dunning's mansion. Cooper {{tries to}} negotiate Frank's surrender, and Frank tells {{him about the}} Vice President's treachery. The terminally ill Joe pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Frank,</b> walks outside, and is killed by sniper from the Vice President's personal hit squad. The confusion, as well as Victoria's cover fire, buys the team enough time to leave the mansion, but Sarah is captured. They escape {{with the help of}} Ivan, who is Victoria's old flame. Frank calls Cooper from his family's phone and warns him against harming Sarah.|$|E
25|$|Winter {{wrote that}} Edmonds did not canvass {{the opinion of}} veterans, which was untrue—some volumes were sent to 1,000 or more {{officers}} for their comments, {{as well as being}} checked against unit diaries down to battalion level—in some cases entire chapters were rewritten (or in the case of Passchendaele, the volume was rewritten several times in the 1940s, during disputes about the roles of Haig and Hubert Gough, who was still alive). Winter quoted, out of context, Edmonds' advice to his researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in his study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be jogged by the draft narrative and that senior officers were more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> if approached informally. Winter doubted that Haig had passed out of Sandhurst top of his year or been awarded the Anson Sword but this was refuted by S. A. Anglim, who consulted the Sandhurst records.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} {{character}} Adrian Monk have been positive. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times called Monk [...] "TV's most original sleuth ever". In {{a review of}} the show's pilot, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle stated: [...] "With his history and his sympathetic but funny 'problems', he [...] becomes one of television's most likable characters and floats a show that is, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> riddled with improbability and simplicity". Monk is ranked number 99 on Bravo's list of The 100 Greatest Television Characters of All Time. He was named one of TV's Smartest Detectives by AOL.|$|E
500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally from The Bronx, New York, Frank was the {{intended}} pilot of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, which crashed {{on an island}} in the South Pacific. He is first encountered in The Bahamas, ringing the NTSB to state that the body of the pilot of Flight 815 shown on the sea bed, on the Television news, is not who it is claimed <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Frank</b> is later recruited as a pilot on behalf of Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who is chartering a freighter destined for the island upon which Flight 815 crashed. Frank reveals himself to be a conspiracy theorist who believes there are still survivors of Flight 815. He goes on to pilot a helicopter from the freighter to the island, which malfunctions on approach. His team—consisting of Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) and Miles Straume (Ken Leung)—parachute to safety, and Frank is able to land the helicopter without incurring significant damage. Lapidus identifies Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) as a [...] "local" [...] and in response to the return of Charlotte, who was being held hostage by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), flies Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) to the freighter.|$|E

He had been studying abroad in Germany for a time, and comes back to where Efs story takes place. Shuichi is a neighbor of Renji's and is good friends with him despite the age difference. Shuichi knows Yu Himura and Chihiro as well, but she forgets Shuichi due to her condition. He meets the main heroine from the fourth chapter of the story named [...] after being introduced by Renji's mother. She goes to an affiliated school and admires Kei greatly {{as someone who is}} older than she is; in fact, Mizuki is also on her school's girls' basketball team. She greatly enjoys reading shōjo manga. She has a straightforward attitude and likes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank</b> towards others, especially to Kei. She initially comes to Otowa to visit her older cousin Renji, and this is when she meets Shuichi. Shuichi keeps to himself that he is dying of a special case of neurosis, of which Mizuki is aware of, but even though she tries to get closer to him, he forcibly pushes her away and rejects her affections. Mizuki becomes depressed and obtains Chihiro's diary. Casually reading it, she finds Yu's name which she recognizes from her past. Mizuki goes to the church to find Yu, but the chapter ends shortly after.|$|E
500|$|Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer was {{critical}} of Batgirl's characterization, calling it a [...] "bland, no-frills reading of the character, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance." [...] Wilson also lamented that the emphasis on Batgirl's hacking abilities proved {{to be no more}} than a simple extension of Arkham Knights remote hacking environmental puzzles. She offered words similar to Stapleton's on how the lack of additional challenge maps confines the Batgirl character model to only the DLC. Wilson was skeptical as to whether the future season pass DLC would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety. Carter gave the DLC a 6.5 out of 10, reacting positively to the confinement to the [...] "good bits" [...] of Arkham Knight, more specifically the lack of the Batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle-solving - he also compared it favorably to the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews. In contrast to Stapleton, Carter felt that not many of the environments were particularly memorable, and also felt the length was sufficient compared to the game's previous story packs. Carter pointed out that a benefit to the game would be a free-roaming option involving the downloadable characters. Meanwhile, Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the DLC should have been provided free of charge, remarking on the campaign's shortness and calling it [...] "straightforward" [...] and [...] "lackluster". He also criticized Warner Bros. for their marketing campaign with Arkham Knight and its DLC, commenting on their sacrificing quality over quantity to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content.|$|E

2500|$|Communist {{leaders and}} intellectuals took many {{different}} positions on LGBT-rights issues. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels said very {{little on the}} subject in their published works. Marx in particular commented rarely on sexuality in general. Norman Markowitz, writing for politicalaffairs.net, writes that: [...] "Here, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>frank,</b> one finds from Marx a refusal to entertain the subject, and from Engels open hostility to the individuals involved." [...] This is because, in private, Engels criticized male homosexuality and related it to ancient Greek pederasty, saying that [...] " [...] fell into the abominable practice of sodomy [...] and degraded alike their gods and themselves with the myth of Ganymede"; Engels {{also said that the}} pro-pederast movement [...] "cannot fail to triumph.
