5000|$|Just {{five days}} after <b>the</b> <b>bombing,</b> on May 29, while Bari was still in hospital, Mike Geniella of the Santa Rosa Press Democrat {{received}} a letter claiming responsibility for placing <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> Bari's car and at the Cloverdale mill. It was written in an ornate, biblical style with heavily misogynistic language and signed [...] "The Lord's Avenger," [...] stating further that the letter writer's motivation was outrage at Bari's offense against his religious sensibilities during an anti-abortion protest at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Ukiah, California in December 1988. The letter also described the construction of <b>the</b> two <b>bombs</b> <b>in</b> great detail. <b>The</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cloverdale sawmill included a pipe bomb {{and a can of}} gasoline, but it failed to ignite and did no damage. <b>The</b> other <b>bomb</b> was <b>in</b> Bari's vehicle. [...] The letter focused suspicion on Bill Staley, a former professional football player and self-styled preacher who had been at the demonstration. Staley was eventually cleared of suspicion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bombing.</b> <b>The</b> detailed description of <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> tied <b>the</b> letter's author to the construction of <b>the</b> <b>bomb,</b> however, <b>the</b> author's explanation of when and where <b>the</b> <b>bomb</b> was placed <b>in</b> Bari's car was found to be implausible.

In June 1980, Israeli agents are said to have assassinated Yehia El-Mashad, an Egyptian atomic scientist working on the Iraqi nuclear program.

25|$|In July 1994, the Jewish {{community}} center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires was bombed, killing 85 people and wounding more than 200.

In 2006, Argentine Justice indicted seven high-ranking former Iranian officials and one senior Hezbollah member, charged with participating in the planning and execution of the AMIA bombing. In 2007, Interpol ordered a red notice to capture the Iranian fugitives. Since then, the Argentine government has requested that Iran extradite the Iranian citizens accused for the attack in order to be judged by an Argentine or a foreign court, but Iran has refused. In response to the deadly attack, Miguel Ángel Pichetto, Senator from the Front for Victory (FpV) said that “real Argentines and Jewish Argentines” were killed, a saying reflecting the attitude towards Jews in the country in those days.|$|E
