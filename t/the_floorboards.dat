5|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, Michael (Tyler Mane) {{continues}} making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts {{to move on}} with his life and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael kills the sanitarium employees and escapes from Smith's Grove. He kills a truck driver for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> the night he killed his sister.|$|E
5|$|Hindley hired {{a vehicle}} {{a week after}} Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, {{apparently}} {{to make sure the}} burial sites had not been disturbed. In February 1964 she bought a second-hand Austin Traveller, but soon after traded it for a Mini van. Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964. His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions. Detectives searched under <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.|$|E
5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through <b>the</b> <b>floorboards.</b> Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{methods for}} {{mitigating}} the blast effects on <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> of passenger vehicles {{due to the}} detonation of explosives buried in water saturated sand underneath vehicles. <b>The</b> effects on <b>floorboard</b> acceleration of adding a vehicle hull, several types of <b>floorboard</b> bracing, <b>the</b> use of foam {{to fill the gap}} between <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> and hull, and the use of foam to isolate <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> from <b>the</b> hull. In addition, several tests have been conducted to examine how the distance of <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> from <b>the</b> ground affects the acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> after <b>the</b> detonation. Testing showed that the addition of a hull to a vehicle, the hulls geometry, bracing of <b>the</b> <b>floorboard,</b> and increasing ground clearance all are able to help reduce floorboard accelerations. However, <b>floorboard</b> bracing had <b>the</b> potential to make accelerations much higher it is hit by the hull during testing. Foam filling between <b>the</b> hull and <b>floorboard</b> as well as a foam frame to isolate <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> from <b>the</b> hull did not have positive results. The primary method of investigation is differentiating a velocity profile found with the use of bar magnet velocity gages on the small scale model floorboard. Several other possible methods of investigation are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Inevitably, the {{accumulated}} bodies beneath his floorboards attracted insects {{and created a}} foul odour — particularly throughout summer months. On occasions when Nilsen disinterred victims from beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards,</b> {{he noted that the}} bodies would be covered with pupae and infested with maggots; some victims' heads had maggots crawling out of eye sockets and mouths. Although Nilsen placed deodorants beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> and sprayed insecticide about the flat twice daily, both the odour of decay and the presence of flies remained.|$|E
25|$|Fox, Henderson took {{possession}} of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of the finished building. More than 5000 navvies worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2000 on site at one time during the peak building phase.|$|E
25|$|Inside, the house's decor {{reflects}} later Victorian stylings, {{due to the}} era {{in which}} it was rebuilt. The walls are plaster on lath; <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> are thin oak.

50|$|Panicked and terrified, Nathalie quickly stores Kent’s naked lifeless {{body in a}} food cellar under <b>the</b> <b>floorboard.</b> When George {{returns from}} his fishing trip, she tries her best to conceal the night’s events and act normal. As the two talk, George notices <b>the</b> loose <b>floorboard</b> that is {{situated}} under the dining table. This is where the food cellar is located and Kent’s head is making <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> protrude outward. George stomps on <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> and corrects <b>the</b> problem. As Nathalie’s panic grows more desperate, George finds flowers and chocolate that Kent gave to Nathalie that night. Questioning her, Nathalie admits to Kent being present in the house the night of his fishing trip. When she reveals his location, George, believing him to be still alive, taunts him. When Nathalie reveals that he is dead, George comes to understand the true desperation of the situation. Taking his body to the nearby tool shed they debate over what course of action to take. The situation is further complicated because Kent’s clothes are missing and his neck was broken by George stomping on the cellar door. George's being a prominent judge and Nathalie's history (as it is now revealed) of early legal trouble for a pill addiction leave them little legal option but {{to dispose of the}} body themselves. Although Nathalie still insists that the authorities should be notified and the situation explained, George insists that it is not possible.|$|R
5000|$|Helm {{described}} {{the start of}} the fire in an interview to the Express newspaper: [...] "a man over from Australia visiting his son got two tickets to the game. He lit a cigarette and when it {{was coming to an end}} he put it down on to <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> and tried to put his foot on it to put it out. It slipped through a hole in <b>the</b> <b>floorboard.</b> A minute later he saw a small plume of smoke so he poured his coffee on it and so did his son. It seemed to put it out. But a minute or so later there was suddenly a bigger whoosh of smoke so they went to get a steward. By the time they got back, the whole thing had taken off." ...|$|R
25|$|February: Unidentified. Murdered {{sometime}} in February 1981. Nilsen recalled little about this victim, {{other than the}} fact he was originally from Belfast, was slim, approximately 5ft.9in. tall, and was aged in his early 20s. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a tie and his body subsequently placed beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traces of red nylon carpet fibres {{were found}} on Tiernan's clothing, which the FSS {{described}} as very distinctive, due to the unusual {{way in which the}} fibre had been dyed. When police searched Taylor's home, they discovered that he had recently removed all carpeting from the house and burned it, but small traces of fibres matching those on the body were found caught on nails in <b>the</b> <b>floorboards.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upstairs {{from the}} main floor, the garret is used for bedrooms. Its {{ceilings}} were built {{at the height of}} the rafter collars. A slight break in the height of <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> corresponds with the masonry seam on the west wall, showing where the original house was added to. There is also evidence of the earlier smoke hood for the larger downstairs fireplace, and the north bedroom shows evidence of the stairway that once existed on that side of the house.|$|E

5000|$|It {{turns out}} that the family that was killed in the 1980s were John Smith's parents. They had an Indian servant who hid John in <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> of <b>the</b> station and told the Indians that he was dead too. The servant was part of a rival Native tribe [...] "The Hopi". The mask really belonged to her tribe and The Chief stole it from her.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} day, Nilsen {{purchased a}} Polaroid camera and photographed Ockenden's body in various suggestive positions. He then lay Ockenden's corpse spreadeagled above {{him on his}} bed as he watched television for several hours, before wrapping the body in plastic bags and stowing the corpse beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards.</b> On approximately four occasions over the following fortnight, Nilsen disinterred Ockenden's body from beneath his floorboards and seated the body upon his armchair alongside him as he himself watched television and drank alcohol.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{survivors}} {{to explain}} exactly {{what had happened}} in the Dom Kultura. Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this atrocity. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys. It could also be established that explosives and machine guns had been used. Human remains and personal possessions were found under the stage, where blood had dripped down through <b>the</b> <b>floorboards.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 19, Edison {{moved to}} Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an {{employee}} of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.|$|E

50|$|A common {{example of}} riding the clutch {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal instead of on <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure {{is not enough to}} allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs. This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.|$|R
50|$|On December 8, a {{customer}} at the Lowe's {{grocery store in}} Clovis spotted who they believed to be Louis Chavez in the store and notified police. As police officers pulled into the store's parking lot, they saw Chavez and another male enter a vehicle.

25|$|The Radza family {{sought refuge}} with a Polish Catholic family, Stephania and Jozef Macugowski. Jozef {{was an old}} friend of Louis Radza's, and had {{previously}} offered assistance if the family ever required it. To hide the Radza family, the Macugowskis dug a secret trench beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of their home. The crawlspace was no more than 5 feet wide, 7 feet long, and 20 inches deep.

25|$|The {{first person}} Christie {{admitted}} to killing was Ruth Fuerst, a 21-year-old Austrian munitions worker who supplemented her income by occasionally engaging in prostitution. Christie {{claimed to have}} met Fuerst while she was soliciting clients in a snack bar in Ladbroke Grove. According to his own statements, on 24 August 1943, he invited Fuerst to his home to engage in sex (his wife was visiting relatives at the time). Afterwards, Christie impulsively strangled her on his bed with a length of rope. He initially stowed Fuerst's body beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of his living room, and buried her body in the back garden the following evening.|$|E

25|$|One famous bakeneko {{story is}} about a man named Takasu Genbei, whose mother’s {{personality}} changed completely after his pet cat went missing for many years. His mother avoided the company {{of friends and family}} and would take her meals alone in her room. When the family peeked in on her, they saw a cat-like monster in the mother's clothes, chewing on animal carcasses. Takasu, still skeptical, slew what looked like his mother, and after one day his mother's body turned back into his pet cat that had been missing. Takasu then tore up <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of his mother's room to find her skeleton hidden there, her bones gnawed clean of all flesh.|$|E

25|$|John Reginald Halliday Christie (8 April 1899 – 15 July 1953), {{known to}} his family and friends as Reg Christie, was an English serial killer active during the 1940s and early 1950s. He murdered at least eight people – {{including}} his wife, Ethel – by strangling them in his flat at 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London. Christie moved out of Rillington Place during March 1953; soon afterward the bodies of three of his victims were discovered hidden in a wallpaper-covered alcove in the kitchen. Two further bodies were discovered in the garden, and his wife's body was found beneath <b>the</b> <b>floorboards</b> of the front room.

50|$|Analysis of {{the bomb}} by FBI experts {{determined}} that the explosive device was a pipe bomb with nails wrapped to its surface for shrapnel effect, {{and that it was}} equipped with a timer-armed motion trigger to ensure that it would explode only when the car was driven. The bomb was also placed on <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> directly under <b>the</b> driver's seat, not on <b>the</b> <b>floorboard</b> behind <b>the</b> seat as the Oakland Police Department had claimed. That evidence pointed to the bomb being an anti-personnel device placed with the intent of killing the driver of Bari's car. Despite that evidence, the FBI investigation remained focused on the theory that the explosion was an accidental detonation of a device knowingly transported by Bari, with attempts to match roofing nails transported in Bari's car to finishing nails used with the bomb. After seven weeks of continual news stories citing repeated police claims that all evidence pointed to Bari and Cherney as culprits, the Alameda County District Attorney announced that he would not file any formal charges against the pair due to insufficient evidence against them. Law enforcement agencies never followed through on the evidence that the bombing was an attempt on Bari's life and the crime would go unsolved.|$|R
