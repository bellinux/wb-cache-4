Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist.

It reported to <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg.

5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E
5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature enacted a corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> education were named as defendants in the case.|$|E

5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal money, {{and the relative}} prosperity of the state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; {{by the time he}} left office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven to eight months. Counties were also allowed to double their school tax rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who had been denied admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, M.A.C. {{expanded}} its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it {{changed its name}} to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Agriculture, John A. Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, {{with the help of the}} 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, {{the mayor}} of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> health, informing them that yellow fever had reached {{epidemic}} levels {{in the city and}} requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to disinfect the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E

5|$|Texas has a plural {{executive}} branch system limiting {{the power of}} the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some {{executive branch}}es split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When Republican President George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education, and the Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time as his gubernatorial {{campaign}} began, Blackburn appeared before the Kentucky General Assembly to advocate measures to protect the state against disease outbreaks, including the creation of a state board of health and the construction of quarantine centers in the state's border towns. To a large degree, his pleas fell upon deaf ears, with the exception of his proposal for <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>board</b> <b>of</b> health, which was created in March 1878. Soon after, news came that yellow fever had appeared in the lower Mississippi Valley earlier than usual; by August 1878, it had reached epidemic proportions. Blackburn advocated implementing quarantines to deal with the influx of people fleeing north to escape the disease, but many of the state's doctors did not believe yellow fever could survive as far north as Kentucky. Some towns in the Jackson Purchase region attempted to implement crude quarantines, but the city of Louisville completely ignored Blackburn's advice and welcomed refugees from the South. Blackburn temporarily halted his gubernatorial campaign and traveled to Louisville to help treat those who arrived there already suffering from the disease.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt did not fare as well {{in state}} politics. He ardently {{supported}} Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks, but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, and supported a $300,000 loan from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, and the railroad was not completed until 1851. Breathitt was {{also part of the}} temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high murder rate in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.|$|E
