5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in the stained glass, and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; the stained glass of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E

50|$|Invisibility Glasses: When used, these glasses force all {{hunters to}} ignore the {{contestant}} for two minutes. If, due to a hunter's forward momentum, the hunter tags the player while <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> active, that capture is nullified. In addition, once removed, <b>the</b> <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> deactivated, regardless of remaining invisibility time.|$|R

25|$|In outside vapor {{deposition}} or vapor axial deposition, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{formed by}} flame hydrolysis, a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H2O) in an oxyhydrogen flame. In outside vapor deposition <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short seed rod is used, and a porous preform, whose length {{is not limited}} {{by the size of}} the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous preform is consolidated into a transparent, solid preform by heating to about 1,800K (1,500°C, 2,800°F).|$|E
25|$|Former: The major {{component}} of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> silica, which during the Roman period was sand (quartz), which contains some alumina (typically 2.5%) and nearly 8% lime. Alumina contents vary, peaking around 3% in glasses from the western Empire, and remaining notably lower in glasses from the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{differences}} {{across the surface}} of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight, but can also occur due to thermal differences {{along the edge of the}} glass where it is secured to the frame, which acts as a heat sink.|$|E

25|$|The 'calcine' {{generated}} is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented glass. The resulting {{glass is}} a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into stainless steel cylindrical containers ("cylinders") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies ("vitrifies") into the glass. After being formed, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> highly resistant to water.|$|E
25|$|The Lady chapel forms a bright, spacious part of {{the church}} dating from the 13th century. It is an {{extension}} of the north transept. The interior carving around the windows and arches features ball-flower motif of the Decorated Period. The present windows and the windows of the north transept are good examples of curvilinear tracery, typical {{of the first half of}} the 14th century, although <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> from a later period.

25|$|Trinitite, {{also known}} as atomsite or Alamogordo glass, is the glassy residue left on the desert floor after the plutonium-based Trinity nuclear bomb test on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} composed of arkosic sand composed of quartz grains and feldspar (both microcline and smaller amount of plagioclase with small amount of calcite, hornblende and augite in a matrix of sandy clay) that was melted by the atomic blast. It is usually a light green, although color can vary. It is mildly radioactive but safe to handle.|$|E

25|$|The {{new house}} {{features}} {{a set of}} automatically operated blinds that prevent it overheating {{when the sun is}} too hot for the plants together with a system that blows a continuous stream of cool air over the plants. The main design aim of the house is to allow maximum light transmission. To this end <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> of a special low iron type that allows 90 per cent of the ultraviolet light in sunlight to pass. It is attached by high tension steel cables so that no light is obstructed by traditional glazing bars.|$|E
25|$|High vacuum inside glass-walled {{cathode ray}} tubes permits {{electron}} beams to fly freely—without colliding into molecules of air or other gas. If <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray {{at high speed}} in all directions. The implosion energy {{is proportional to the}} evacuated volume of the CRT. Although modern cathode ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have epoxy-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{glass inside}} a {{cylinder}} {{is usually a}} black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

25|$|Canterbury Cathedral retains more ancient glass {{than any}} other English cathedral except York. Much of it is appears to be {{imported}} from France and some is very early, dating from the 11th century. Much of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{in the style of}} Chartres Cathedral with deep blue featuring as the background colour in most windows. There are wide borders of stylised floral motifs and small pictorial panels of round, square or diaper shape. Other windows contain rows of apostles, saints and prophets. These windows, including the large west window have a predominance of red, pink, brown and green in the colours, with smaller areas of blue. Most of the glass in this remarkable window is older than the 15th-century stone tracery that contains it, the figure of Adam being part of a series of Ancestors of Christ that are among the oldest surviving panels in England.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> full.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{descriptions}} of Theophilus and Agricola, the only depiction of an early forest glasshouse is from Bohemia in abpproximately 1380 (The Mandeville Miniature). This shows a furnace where all the high temperature processes of glassmaking were performed in the one structure containing several ovens whose varying temperatures might be controlled to the necessary extent by constant attention. The raw materials are mixed at a pit nearby and carried down in pans to be fritted {{in one of the}} ovens, optimum temperature up to 1100°C. The frit is melted at high temperature up to 1400°C in crucibles in a second oven, and when ready, <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> being blown into objects. These are placed in the annealing oven to cool. The whole structure is enclosed in a wooden building, and it is likely that wood was stored and dried above the furnace. Remains of a similar structure from the late fifteenth century have been found in Eichsfeld in Germany. Another design found archaeologically from the seventeenth century is the 'butterfly furnace'. These furnaces were made from stone and the crucibles from imported, highly-refractory clay. They differ in style from the Islamic furnaces of the east, and those of southern Europe, the 'beehive' style where the annealing chamber is above the main oven rather than on the same level.|$|E
