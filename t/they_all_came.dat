25|$|Makdisi states Islamic {{law also}} {{parallels}} the legal scholastic {{system in the}} West, which {{gave rise to the}} modern university system. He writes that the triple status of faqih ("master of law"), mufti ("professor of legal opinions") and mudarris ("teacher"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms magister, professor and doctor, respectively, although <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> to be used synonymously in both East and West. Makdisi suggests that the medieval European doctorate, licentia docendi was modeled on the Islamic degree ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta’, of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term ifta’ (issuing of fatwas) omitted. He also argues that these systems shared fundamental freedoms: the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning.|$|E

[...] In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein {{produced}} several [...] "fantasy drama" [...] paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as Drowning Girl, Hopeless and In the Car. [...] These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent [...] "girls next door" [...] in a variety of tenuous emotional states. [...] "In Hopeless and Drowning Girl, for example, the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs, with one displaying helplessness... and the other defiance (she would rather drown than ask for her lover's help)." [...] Drowning Girl, the aforementioned works and Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But... are among those tragedies that make the author a popular draw at museums.|$|E

In the book, [...] "Millett writes about the situation—her mother's distance and imperiousness, her family's failure to recognize the humanity of the old and the insane—with brutal honesty. Yet she also describes moments of forgiveness, humility and admiration."

2500|$|... “The Council of State of {{the first}} Arab {{government}} in Mesopotamia since the (thirteenth century) Abbasid’s” as Bell described it, met on Tuesday, 2 November 1920. Along with Sassoon as Minister of Finance, Jafar Pasha al-Askari as Minister of Defence and six other ministers including Sayid Talib as Minister of the Interior. The {{next step was to}} choose a King to unite the tribally fractured country. Sassoon had already offered his opinions on the matter as was recounted again by Miss Bell: “I had a long and interesting talk with Sasun Eff. the other day—I went to call on his sister in law and found all the men there eager to embark on talk. Sasun Eff. said he felt sure that no local man would be acceptable as head of the state because every other local man would be jealous of him. He went on to throw out feelers in different directions—one might think of a son of the Sharif, or {{a member of the family}} of the Sultan of Egypt, if there was a suitable individual, or of the family of the Sultan of Turkey? I said I for my part felt sure that Sir Percy didn't and couldn't mind whom they selected except that I thought the Turkish family was ruled out—it ought to be an Arab prince. Sasun Eff. said [...] "If they think you are backing S. Talib they will all agree outwardly to S. Talib, whatever they think of him. I remember when once I happened to be on the same boat with him coming back from Constantinople —it was when S. Talib was a deputy. Almost without exception the people of Basrah hated and feared him, and if you'll believe me <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> down to Muhammarah to welcome him! and the ones that hated him most gave him the most cordial reception. They were afraid of him. So it would be now." [...] I again insisted that we could find no interest or advantage in backing anyone; it was entirely a matter for the people themselves to decide, but whether he believed me or not I can't say. He had, however, hit on the root of the matter. Anyone they think we're backing they will agree to—and then intrigue against him without intermission. It's not an easy furrow to plough!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Kuroda pitched 6 1/3 {{innings and}} allowed three runs, {{including}} {{a two-run homer}} to pitcher John Lannan as the Dodgers lost 7-2 to the Washington Nationals at Dodger Stadium on July 23. Rafael Furcal hit a walk-off double to beat the Nationals the next day as the Dodgers came from three runs behind to win 7-6. Chad Billingsley overcame a shaky first inning to retire 21 of the last 22 batters he faced, striking out 10 in seven innings as the Dodgers picked up a rare series win with a 3-1 victory. Rookie pitchers Rubby De La Rosa and Javy Guerra led the Dodgers to an 8-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on July 25. De La Rosa threw a career-high 113 pitches, allowing just three hits and a run in six innings. After the bullpen faltered in the ninth, Guerra came in {{with the bases loaded}} and retired the Rockies four and five hitters for the save. The Dodgers won their fourth straight the following day, as Kershaw picked up his 12th win of the season with a 3-2 victory. With the trading deadline approaching and much speculation about the possibility of him being traded, Hiroki Kuroda took the mound for the Dodgers on July 27. Kuorda pitched well, allowing only one run in six innings but was saddled with his 13th loss when the Dodgers offense again failed to hit, scoring only 1 run in the 3-1 defeat. Kuroda, despite pitching well all season, became the first Dodger pitcher with back to back 13 loss seasons since Orel Hershiser in 1992 and 1993. Matt Kemp homered and knocked in five runs in the Dodgers 9-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 29. Chad Billingsley walked five batters in 5 2/3 innings and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>came</b> around to score as the Dodgers dropped a game to the Diamondbacks 6-4. Meanwhile, Kuroda exercised the [...] "no trade clause" [...] in his contract to ensure he would remain with the team {{for the remainder of the}} season. The Dodgers did make a move though, trading injury prone shortstop Rafael Furcal to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor league outfielder Alex Castellanos. The Dodgers month came to a close when Rubby De La Rosa allowed back-to-back home runs to the Diamondbacks in the second inning and the team limped to a 6-3 defeat, finishing off yet another month with a losing record.|$|E
