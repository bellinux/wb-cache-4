5|$|Princess Elsa of Arendelle {{possesses}} cryokinetic magic, often {{using it}} to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen,</b> rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa’s magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Peace Prize banquet {{is held in}} Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel {{after the}} award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the President of the Storting, the Prime Minister, and, since 2006, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.|$|E
5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out of her room. Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E

5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E

5|$|The {{trip was}} {{intended}} to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public {{with regard to the}} developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> were enthusiastically received by the public. The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled. They visited the 1939 New York World's Fair and stayed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House and at his private estate at Hyde Park, New York. A strong bond of friendship was forged between <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.|$|E

5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E
5|$|In late 1910, he {{accompanied}} the Duke of Connaught to South Africa, {{and the next}} year went with King George V to India for the Delhi Durbar, where he had the opportunity to photograph the King on a tiger hunt as well as in more formal contexts. After returning from India he left the royal household to open a studio on Buckingham Palace Road in central London, meanwhile continuing to describe himself as the Official Photographer to <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided {{to add a}} new chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood {{in the context of}} its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1938, a {{state visit}} to France by <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> was {{postponed}} {{for three weeks}} because {{of the death of}} the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{between the end of}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1912 and Italy's entry into the First World War in 1915, Amalfi is {{mentioned}} in several news accounts that offer hints of her peace-time activities. In June 1913, Amalfi escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife, Queen Elena, on the royal yacht Trinacria to the annual regatta at Kiel, Germany. While there, Victor Emmanuel met with Kaiser Wilhelm II, to discuss—it was speculated in a contemporary news report—the ongoing Balkan War. After departing from Kiel, Amalfi escorted <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> on Trinacria to their next stop at Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E

5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, the remains of <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand {{at the corners of}} the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E
5|$|Hungerford Crewe {{never married}} {{and on his}} death in 1894, the barony became extinct. The hall was {{inherited}} by his nephew, Robert Milnes, Baron Houghton (1858–1945), the son of Annabella Hungerford Crewe; he adopted the name Crewe, to become Crewe-Milnes. The Crewe title was revived as an earldom for him in 1895, and he later became the Marquess of Crewe. A Liberal politician and poet, Crewe-Milnes held several key Cabinet positions between 1905 and 1916, and was a trusted aide to Asquith. He was also a friend of George V, and <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> Mary stayed at the hall for three days in 1913, while touring the Staffordshire Potteries.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Downes began {{a tour of}} {{military}} and other medical centres in India, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Canada. While in London, he arranged for Doris and Valerie to be formally presented to <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen</b> at Buckingham Palace by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Downes foresaw a major war, fought in the islands {{to the north of}} Australia. While in London, he took steps to obtain the services as consultants of two eminent Australian physicians, the surgeon Sir Thomas Dunhill and Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical diseases. The outbreak of the Second World War caused Downes to curtail the North American leg of his tour, and return to Australia in October 1939.|$|E

Several guests are in attendance, including Rapunzel's birth parents, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>Queen,</b> the pub thugs and the Stabbington Brothers, while their animal friends Pascal, a chameleon, and Maximus, a horse, serve as the Flower boy and ring bearer respectively. Just as a brown-haired Rapunzel, accompanied by her father, completes her journey down the aisle to unite with Eugene, Maximus, who is carrying the wedding rings on a pillow in his mouth, has a reaction to one of Pascal's flower petals and sneezes, expelling the rings {{down the aisle and}} out onto the city streets.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Ophelia {{rushes to}} her father, {{telling him that}} Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and {{behaving}} crazily. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>queen</b> finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through a portion of Denmark to get there.|$|E
