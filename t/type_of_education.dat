African Americans were offered a basic education that enabled them {{to return to their}} communities and support themselves within the system. Washington feared that if a colored school challenged the politics of the day, white citizens might refuse to allow it to open or would later shut it down. This was not the classical <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> offered to many white students in the north. Highly educated African Americans such as W. E. B. Du Bois thought the Tuskegee model was too limited and did not support it. Born in Massachusetts and educated in the North, including a doctorate at Harvard University, he argued for ensuring that the most talented students could get a full academic education, to advance the race.|$|E
500|$|In The Demands of Liberal Education, Meira Levinson {{sets out}} to write a [...] "coherent liberal {{political}} theory of children's education" [...] that establishes how education can mutually satisfy the conflicting interests {{of the state and}} its diverse citizenry. [...] "Liberal education" [...] is defined as the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> that follows from a liberal society's values. Levinson writes that the intent of liberal education is to maximize individual autonomy in successive generations, particularly by [...] "cultivating the 'capacity' to exercise liberty". Autonomy and its cultivation is the primary moral aim of liberal education. Levinson argues from a liberal political philosophy rather than from a philosophy of education, and contends that a broad liberal education best equips for individual autonomy and thus creates the best republic.|$|E

Interpellations led to a debate in the City Council, mainly between Steinholt and County Cabinet leader Odd Eriksen. She believed it would be disrespectful towards workers to deprive them the right of a dignified work age, feeling that forcing them to quit their jobs at the age of 62 is too early.|$|E

40|$|Few, if any, {{previous}} studies of the determinants of literacy and numeracy in Ghana and elsewhere have examined the impact <b>of</b> <b>education</b> reform on literacy and numeracy production and have mostly also been limited to considering the proficiency in only one language and numeracy and to considering only skills impacts from more traditional <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> Examining the impact of traditional schooling, technical-vocational education and training, and adult literacy programs on literacy and numeracy in Ghana, this paper addresses all three issues. A comparison of outcomes {{before and after the}} 1987 Education Sector Reform indicates that, consistent with the objective of the Reform, the productivity <b>of</b> primary <b>education</b> in terms <b>of</b> literacy and numeracy increased, while the productivity of other levels and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> decreased. Additionally, large skills differentials in Ghana related to gender, ethnicity, rural/urban location and region of residence are established.

2500|$|After the Revolution, Rush {{proposed}} {{a new model}} of education for elite women that included English language, vocal music, dancing, sciences, bookkeeping, history, and moral philosophy. He was instrumental to the founding of the Young Ladies' Academy of Philadelphia, the first chartered women's institution of higher education in Philadelphia. [...] Rush saw little need for training women in metaphysics, logic, mathematics, or advanced science; rather he wanted the emphasis on guiding women toward moral essays, poetry, history, and religious writings. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> for elite women grew dramatically during the post-revolutionary period, as women claimed a role in creating the Republic. And so, the ideal of Republican motherhood emerged, lauding women's responsibility of instructing the young in the obligations of patriotism, the blessings of liberty and the true meaning of Republicanism.

40|$|September 2014 {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of a new law proclaiming inclusive education for all Dutch children. The goal <b>of</b> inclusive <b>education</b> is to have education in which all children can develop optimal cognitive, social and emotional skills. Currently, the selection <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> special <b>education</b> for children with a handicap and/or behavioral problems is based on the diagnosis of the developmental disabilities of the child. In inclusive education, the educational needs of the child constitute the starting point. Teachers favor these changes, but are afraid that the amount of children with behavioral problems in the classroom will increase. The principle <b>of</b> inclusive <b>education</b> will result in a different distribution of children with a behavioral problem in the three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> for children with educational needs: primary education, special primary education and specific needs education. Children with diagnosed ADHD will also be part of this redistribution. To be able to serve children with ADHD well, it is important to know what children with ADHD in special education programs need. This research aims to contribute to this by investigating the differences in psychosocial skills among children with ADHD in the three before mentioned <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in Holland. The variables measured are: psychosocial skills, level of ADHD-symptoms, cognitive development, and family and demographic characteristics. The random sample consisted of 93 children aged 4 - 12 with (the presumption of) ADHD in the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in Holland. The results show that the psychosocial skills of children with ADHD are good predictors <b>of</b> the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> the children with ADHD will get. The less well-developed the psychosocial skills are, the more specialized the level <b>of</b> special <b>education</b> is. The educational level of the wage-earner in the family en the gender of the child also are important predictors. What is striking, is that there is no difference in ADHD-symptoms between the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> It is concluded from the research that inclusive education must focus on the psychosocial skills of children with ADHD and support the development of these skills in primary education to optimum achieve the goals <b>of</b> inclusive <b>education...</b>|$|R

Then in 1740, Canon György Foglár founded a Faculty of Law and in 1754 bishop Barkóczy set up a school of philosophy. In 1769 the first medical school of Hungary was opened by the direction of Ferenc Markhot, but it was closed in 1755. Unfortunately the university of Eger could not begin its work because of appoint ... the monarch'. In the building which was marked out for the university we can find the Archdiocese's Library (the most beautiful baroque library in Hungary), and an astronomical museum with original equipment, which was the second museum of this type in Europe. Between 1946 and 1948 there were several more efforts to found a university in Eger all of which also ended in failure.|$|E
