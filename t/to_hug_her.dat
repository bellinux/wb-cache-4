25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E
2500|$|Silva {{asked him}} where he shot the picture and was looking around to take the photo too. Carter pointed to a place [...] away. Then Carter {{told him that he}} had chasing the vulture away. He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He lit a cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> when I get home." [...] A few minutes later they got into the small UN plane and left Ayod for Kongor.|$|E
2500|$|She was {{required}} to begin her jail term on June 5, and entered the Century Regional Detention Facility (a women's prison in Lynwood, California) after attending the 2007 MTV Movie Awards on June 3. On June 7, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca signed an order resentencing Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition. Baca said, [...] "My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities {{more than the average}} American is not justice." [...] He added, [...] "The special treatment, in a sense, appears to be because of her celebrity status... She got more time in jail". Judge Michael Sauer summoned her to reappear in court the following morning (June 8), since her original sentence specified imprisonment: [...] "No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring." [...] At the hearing, Sauer declined a briefing in chambers by Hilton's attorney on her medical condition and sent her back to jail to serve the original 45-day sentence. When she heard the decision, Hilton shouted [...] "It's not right!" [...] Screaming, she asked <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> mother. Hilton was moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, and returned to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on June 13.|$|E

5000|$|Baby (voiced by Charlotte Nicdao) is {{the sweetest}} member of HJ5. She is loving and carefree, though {{sometimes}} this gets her in trouble. She adores everything {{that she thinks}} is cute, and also loves <b>to</b> give <b>hugs.</b> <b>Her</b> signature color is pink, and she represents cuteness.|$|R
50|$|After the trashing {{early in}} the novel, Jane feels bad about arguing with her sister. A lot of {{thoughts}} come to her about her relationship with Karen. The incident {{in the house and}} Karen's coma make Jane’s behaviour change. She feels less comfortable in her home. Then she goes out with Buddy Walker. She allows him <b>to</b> kiss <b>her,</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> and caress her. She thinks that when she is with Buddy everything is wonderful and her troubles go away, but {{he was one of the}} trashers.|$|R
60|$|He said {{he would}} often fly in to see her. The first thing he would do would be <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b> No, he would alight on the water-jug first, and have a drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is just lovely, I think," [...] said Faith. [...] "Just {{as nice as}} Mrs. Blythe--but different. I felt as if I wanted <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b> She did hug ME--such a nice, velvety hug. And {{she called}} me 'dearest.' It THRILLED me. I could tell her ANYTHING." ...|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Keith leant {{over the}} back of her chair and silently watched, but the scene was not quite what they expected. Violetta was sitting in her [...] "slantingdicular" [...] {{position}} on her chair placed on a bench, and her little mistress knelt down before her, took her in her arms, and began <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{event that}} {{generated}} the allegation of rape was later clarified by Sister Maurina herself. According to her, a tall, blonde officer once entered her cell and started <b>to</b> passionately <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> {{saying that he}} had not seen his wife for a long time. The Sister claims that she told him to back down, and then he picked up a pistol and wanted her to hold it, in order to get her fingerprints on the gun.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{protested that}} Mrs Buggins {{was a stupid}} woman,--the stupidest woman she had ever heard or seen; and then hurried up into <b>her</b> own room <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> herself in <b>her</b> joy, and teach herself to believe that what so many people said must at last come true.|$|R
50|$|Rule 1: Matthew must sit and eat {{to tell a}} lie.Matthew {{can tell}} that Sheena is upset with something. So he implores Sheena to tell him. She says that there is trouble with their marriage, and that she wishes someone would talk <b>to</b> Adam. Matthew <b>hugs</b> <b>her,</b> just as Carrie walks in, and Carrie is mad at the fact of Matthew hugging Sheena.|$|R
60|$|The senator's son and Phil had {{accompanied}} Dave to Crumville, and all {{had received a}} warm reception {{at the hands of}} those who were waiting for them. Mr. Wadsworth was delighted to get back the jewels, and thanked Dave over and over again for what he had done. Dave's father and his uncle were also happy, and as for Laura, she had <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> brother over and over again. Jessie wanted to hug him, too, but her maidenly modesty prevented this, but she gave Dave a look and a hand squeeze that meant a good deal, for our hero was her hero, too, and always had been.|$|E
6000|$|Parting {{with her}} {{after four years}} under her was a real grief. Even Griff was fond of her; when once emancipated, he used <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> and bring her {{remarkable}} presents, and she heartily loved her tormentor. [...] Everybody did. It remained {{a great pleasure to}} get her to spend an evening with us while the elders were gone out to dinner; nor do I think she ever did us anything but good, though I am afraid we laughed at 'Old Newton' as we grew older and more conceited. We never had another governess. My mother read and enforced diligence on Emily and me, and we had masters for different studies; the two boys went to school; and when Martyn began to emerge from babyhood, Emily was his teacher.|$|E
60|$|Jo {{looked up}} then, quite {{unconscious}} of anything but her own {{pleasure in the}} prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled {{the fact that she}} might find Laurie more than a 'best friend', and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina on her knee. She didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child was moved <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her,</b> so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he said cordially...|$|E
5000|$|... “Wilde… paints an odalisque {{wrapped in}} tendrils of a {{strawberry}} plant, echoing Botticelli’s ‘The Birth of Venus’, veiled in her golden hair. A strawberry is what covers Wilde’s woman, but the strawberry she <b>hugs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> breast is huge, {{half the size}} of her torso.” ...|$|R
50|$|Having {{finally had}} second-thoughts, Alex does not recite her {{original}} speech, instead giving a sincere, but halting speech that simultaneously quotes motivational songs and praises her grade. Afterward, Alex {{is invited to}} a graduation party and goes there, much to Phil and Claire's growing dismay, but Haley responds {{that she could have}} lunch with her parents, <b>to</b> which they <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> effusively, embarrassing her in front of the entire school.|$|R
60|$|I led {{him without}} any delay into Mrs. Bunter's private sitting-room. After she had dropped a tear over the late cannibal, given a <b>hug</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Winston, {{and told him}} that he must grow his {{moustache}} again, the dear lady tucked her feet upon the sofa, and I got out of Bunter's way.|$|R
60|$|It {{continued}} to rain {{so hard that}} our young lady's private dream of explaining the Continent to their visitor had to contain a provision for some adequate treatment of the weather. At the table d'hôte that evening she threw out a variety of lights: {{this was the second}} ceremony of the sort she had sat through, and she would have neglected her privilege and dishonoured her vocabulary--which indeed consisted mainly of the names of dishes--if she had not been proportionately ready to dazzle with interpretations. Preoccupied and overawed, Mrs. Wix was apparently dim: she accepted her pupil's version of the mysteries of the menu in a manner that might have struck the child as the depression of a credulity conscious not so much of its needs as of its dimensions. Maisie was soon enough--though it scarce happened before bedtime--confronted again with the different sort of programme for which she reserved her criticism. They remounted together to their sitting-room while Sir Claude, who said he would join them later, remained below to smoke and to converse with the old acquaintances that he met wherever he turned. He had proposed his companions, for coffee, the enjoyment of the salon de lecture, but Mrs. Wix had replied promptly and with something of an air that it struck her their own apartments offered them every convenience. They offered the good lady herself, Maisie could immediately observe, not only that of this rather grand reference, which, already emulous, so far as it went, of her pupil, she made as if she had spent her life in salons; but that of a stiff French sofa where she could sit and stare at the faint French lamp, in default of the French clock that had stopped, as for some account of the time Sir Claude would so markedly interpose. Her demeanour accused him so directly of hovering beyond her reach that Maisie sought to divert her by a report of Susan's quaint attitude on the matter of their conversation after lunch. Maisie had mentioned to the young woman for sympathy's sake the plan for her relief, but her disapproval of alien ways appeared, strange to say, only to prompt her <b>to</b> <b>hug</b> <b>her</b> gloom; so that between Mrs. Wix's effect of displacing her and the visible stiffening of her back the child had the sense of a double office and enlarged play for pacific powers.|$|E

50|$|Horrified, {{she watches}} as Jack collapses, while Lugov enters and prepares to shoot her. Before {{he can do}} so, Jack pulls out the knife and flings it across the room, burying it in Lugov's throat. He then readies his gun and shoots through the wall into the {{adjacent}} garage, killing the other guard outside. Jack goes over <b>to</b> Renee and <b>hugs</b> <b>her,</b> noticing the state of Laitanin's body, while she begins to cry.|$|R

"Dr. X. {{told me that}} in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs {{took refuge}} in a great cave in the {{mountains}} about 90 miles north of Johannesburg, and the Boers blocked up the entrance and smoked them to death.

60|$|Then {{there was}} a splash, and, behold! the girl at his side had sprung into the swiftly running river. Though its waters, {{reaching}} to her neck, washed her down the stream, she <b>hugged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> young breast that great, slippery fish, yes, and gripped its back fin between her teeth, till {{with the aid of}} his reed rod he drew them both to land.|$|R
