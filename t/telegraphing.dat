5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such <b>telegraphing</b> to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

25|$|The title First Among Sequels was {{met with}} stiff {{resistance}} from Fforde's publishers because it had 'sequel' in the title, and {{it was felt that}} <b>telegraphing</b> the 'sequelness' of the book might be a bad move. It was decided, however, to capitalise on {{the fact that this was}} a series - a sort of 'Have you discovered Thursday Next yet?' approach to marketing.|$|E

In 1934, Imperial and International Communications, formerly the Eastern <b>Telegraph</b> Company (the amalgamation of those 32 <b>telegraph</b> companies), became Cable & Wireless. The new name {{was designed to}} more clearly reflect the combined radio and cable services which it offered, {{without reference to the}} Empire. Cable & Wireless is one of the world's leading international communications companies. It operates through two standalone business units. International and Europe, Asia & U.S.|$|R
25|$|A leap-frogging tactic {{was also}} {{employed}} to maintain momentum. Spearhead units would sometimes deploy quickly to tackle opposition, while follow-on echelons bypassed such engagements to strike deeper. Infiltration units like sappers also assisted the push by seizing bridges, road junctions {{and other key}} points ahead of the main forces. Deception measures were also widely used, with diversionary operations across a broad area, and troop movements timed until the last minute, to avoid <b>telegraphing</b> the main points of attack. Such methods for example, enabled quick conquest of towns like Ban Me Thuot and their surrounding highways, and {{paved the way for}} further operations towards Saigon.|$|E
25|$|Counter punchers are slippery, {{defensive}} style {{fighters who}} often {{rely on their}} opponent's mistakes {{in order to gain}} the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid <b>telegraphing</b> one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Stanton {{worked to}} create an {{effective}} transportation and communication network across the North. His efforts focused on the railroad system and the telegraph lines. Stanton worked with Senator Wade to push through Congress {{a bill that would}} codify the ability of the President and his administration to forcibly seize railroad and telegraph lines for their purposes. Railroad companies in the North were accommodating to the needs and desires of the federal government for the most part, and the law was rarely used. Stanton also secured the government's use of telegraph. He relocated the military's <b>telegraphing</b> operations from McClellan's army headquarters to his department, a decision the general was none too pleased with. The relocation gave Stanton closer control over the military's communications operations, and he exploited this. Stanton forced all members of the press to work through Assistant Secretary Watson, where unwanted journalists would be disallowed access to official government correspondence. If a member of the press went elsewhere in the department, they would be charged with espionage.|$|E

Towns often booked Sunday meetings informally, sometimes by sending a delegation to hear him preach and then <b>telegraphing</b> him while he was holding services somewhere else.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy {{admired the}} [...] "outstanding" [...] script, calling it ambitious and deceptively simple. He said Eastwood {{respected}} the script by not {{playing to the}} melodramatic aspects and not <b>telegraphing</b> the story's scope from the start. Honeycutt wrote that due to its close adherence to the history the drama sagged at one point, but that the film did not feel as long as its 141 minutes because the filmmakers were [...] "good at cutting to the chase". Ansen said Straczynski's dialogue tended to the obvious, but that while the film lacked the moral nuance of Eastwood's others, the well-researched screenplay was [...] "a model of sturdy architecture", each layer of which built audience disgust into a [...] "fine fury". He said, [...] "when the tale is this gripping, why resist the moral outrage?" ...|$|E

At this time Rockhampton was the main <b>telegraph</b> traffic centre for central and north Queensland and was the largest <b>telegraph</b> office outside Brisbane.|$|R
500|$|While {{shooting}} the first subway scenes, D'Onofrio's performance was over-the-top and bombastic. Yoshimura {{asked him to}} act a little calmer during the earlier scenes and save the energy for the later scenes, because [...] "if he did go up right away, there was nowhere else {{for him to go}} after that". D'Onofrio agreed and modified his performance accordingly. Fleder also clashed with MacVittie over his portrayal of the Biedron character. Fleder felt that the character appeared too crazy in earlier scenes, and that the actor was <b>telegraphing</b> the twist in which MacVittie {{would turn out to be}} a murderer. MacVittie approached Yoshimura about the criticism, but Yoshimura agreed with Fleder's interpretation. After MacVittie toned down the character's behavior, Fleder said that he was extremely pleased with the end result.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{this show}} of bravado, McClellan {{continued}} his cautious line. After <b>telegraphing</b> {{to the president}} at noon on September 13, rather than ordering his units to {{set out for the}} South Mountain passes immediately, he ordered them to depart the following morning. The 18 hours of delay allowed Lee time to react, because he received intelligence from a Confederate sympathizer that McClellan knew of his plans. (The delay also doomed the federal garrison at Harpers Ferry because the relief column McClellan sent could not reach them before they surrendered to Stonewall Jackson.) In the Battle of South Mountain, McClellan's army was able to punch through the defended passes that separated them from Lee, but also gave Lee enough time to concentrate many of his men at Sharpsburg, Maryland. The Battle of South Mountain presented McClellan with an opportunity for one of the great theatrical moments of his career, as historian Sears describes: ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without <b>telegraphing</b> their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once the Civil War {{was over}} the task of reconstructing the Confederate <b>telegraph</b> lines began. [...] The U.S. {{government}} required {{that all of the}} major communication lines were to be repaired and controlled by the U.S. Military <b>Telegraph</b> Corps. [...] Due to the lack of funds, the Confederate <b>telegraph</b> lines were in bad shape when the war ended and the operators of the U.S. Military <b>Telegraph</b> Corps faced a mountain of work. [...] But these men rose to the challenge and on February 27, 1865 an order by the Quartermaster General transferred the Union control of <b>telegraph</b> lines in the South to commercial <b>telegraph</b> companies under the supervision of U.S. Military <b>Telegraph</b> Corps Assistant Superintendents [...] [...] Furthermore, this order relinquished control of all lines seized by the government in the North and sold the lines constructed by the U.S. Military <b>Telegraph</b> Corps to private <b>telegraph</b> companies. [...] Once control of the <b>telegraph</b> lines were turned over to the <b>telegraph</b> companies, the operators were discharged one by one. [...] The only office that remained was the original <b>telegraph</b> office in the War Department.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>Telegraph</b> Act of 1860 {{called for}} the {{facilitation}} of communication between {{the east and west}} coasts of the United States of America. Hiram Sibley of the Western Union <b>Telegraph</b> Company won the contract. In 1861, Benjamin Franklin Ficklin joined Hiram Sibley in helping to form the Pacific <b>Telegraph</b> Company of Nebraska. At the same time, Jeptha Wade was asked by Hiram Sibley to consolidate smaller <b>telegraph</b> companies in California. While the Pacific <b>Telegraph</b> Company built west from Omaha, Nebraska, the Overland <b>Telegraph</b> Company of California was thus formed and built east from Carson City, Nevada. With their connection in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 24, 1861, the final link between the east and west coasts of the United States of America was made by <b>telegraph.</b> The First Transcontinental <b>Telegraph</b> lead to the immediate demise of the Pony Express.

2500|$|Ca. 1890, British {{archeologist}} Alfred Percival Maudslay came to Guatemala, {{and traveled}} the Verapaz; he described Tactic as follows: «Towards evening {{we reached the}} ugly little wind-swept hamlet of Tactic, the usual resting-place for travelers between Cobán and the port of Panzós. Travelers must often fare badly, for one small inn, containing a single bedroom, was all the accommodation the village appeared to afford and but for Mr. Thomae's forethought in <b>telegraphing</b> to secure this room for us, we might have had to share the verandah for the night with native travellers, arrieros, and dogs, and probably have gone supperless to bed. At Tactic we left the cart-road leading to Panzos, which, after surmounting the divide, strikes {{the source of the}} Rio Polochic, and follows its banks to the eastward." ...|$|E

[...] The army withdrew that night to fortified positions in Chattanooga. Bragg had not succeeded in his objective to destroy the Army of the Cumberland, but the Battle of Chickamauga was nonetheless the worst Union defeat in the Western Theater. Thomas urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted {{to prop up the}} morale of his general, <b>telegraphing</b> [...] "Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. If I was to suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you."

2500|$|On September 10, 1876, General Crook Crook ordered Frank Grouard, his trusted Chief Scout, {{to carry}} dispatches to Fort Laramie announcing the battle and victory at Slim Buttes. [...] Grouard’s strict orders were {{to see that}} the {{official}} dispatches were telegraphed first, then followed by the dispatches from the war correspondents. The next morning, Grouard left in company with Captain Anson Mills, Lieut. Bubb and about seventy-five mounted troopers riding ahead to the Black Hills mining camps to purchase provisions for Crook’s starving command. At Crook’s request, Captain Jack joined Mills’s party, accompanied by war correspondents Robert E. Strahorn and Reuben Briggs Davenport. [...] Unknown to Grouard, Davenport wanted an exclusive for the New York Herald and offered to pay Captain Jack five-hundred dollars if he could beat Grouard to the telegraph in Fort Laramie. [...] <b>Telegraphing</b> news of the victory of Slim Buttes thus became a race between Frank Grouard and Captain Jack Crawford.

2500|$|When buying {{gold and}} bonds, Boutwell placed all his orders through Daniel Butterfield in New York. To reduce {{the temptation of}} illicit dealing, Boutwell, at Butterfield's recommendation, {{publicly}} announced his orders by <b>telegraphing</b> the news to the Associated Press. Over {{the next few months}} Treasury gold began to flood the market while Boutwell began buying back wartime bonds. By September 1, Boutwell had reduced the national debt by $50 million. He continued this practice at an accelerated rate while Grant, having closely followed Boutwell's dealings, began to express reservations and sent him a letter from Washington, Pennsylvania criticizing that driving the price of gold down would hurt farmers. Many brokerage firms collapsed while trade volume and agriculture prices plummeted, causing a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. An indignant Boutwell saw little merit in either Grant's (or Gould's) arguments, feeling that the government had no place in manipulating the market regardless of who benefited. However, not wanting to go against the President, Boutwell ordered Butterfield to halt semi-weekly September government gold sales. Believing he now had a [...] "green light" [...] from Grant, Gould began buying gold through brokers at an accelerated rate while his gold account grew from $10 to $18 million in specie.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{withdrew the}} {{remainder}} of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw while his commander and peers fled earned him the nickname Rock of Chickamauga, derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, [...] "Thomas is standing like a rock." [...] Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that [...] "our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full." [...] Although the troops were tired and hungry, and nearly out of ammunition, he continued, [...] "I believe we can whip them tomorrow.
