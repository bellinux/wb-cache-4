5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very <b>tight</b> <b>for</b> two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

25|$|Archdale won the toss {{and chose}} to bat. England did not fare {{as well as}} in the earlier matches, though, and were only able to make 162, with Maclagan top-scoring on 50. Peggy Antonio took 6 for 49. Australia then made 31 for the loss of 1 wicket before stumps on the first day. The second day saw them to 150, just 12 behind England. 59 of these runs, however, were made for the ninth and tenth wicket. Without these, Australia {{probably}} would have slumped to a third consecutive defeat. As it was, however, England were <b>tight</b> <b>for</b> time, declaring on 153 for 7. Australia were made to face 57 overs, but were able to hang on, being eight down when the match ended. England therefore won the series two-nil.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{separator}} theorem of {{this type}} is shown, {{it can be used}} to produce a separator hierarchy for n-vertex planar graphs that again does not depend on the graph structure: the tree-decomposition formed from this hierarchy has width O(√n) and can be used for any planar graph. The set of all pairs of vertices in this tree-decomposition that both belong to a common node of the tree-decomposition forms a trivially perfect graph with O(n3/2) vertices that contains every n-vertex planar graph as a subgraph. A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, where the constant hidden in the O notation depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (or even for trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O(n3/2) upper bound is <b>tight</b> <b>for</b> universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.|$|E
