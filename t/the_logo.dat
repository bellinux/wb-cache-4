5|$|Three {{months after}} {{receiving}} the All-Star Game, the Hurricanes unveiled <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> for the 2011 game. <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> was designed with some homage to the host team and city hidden within it. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> {{is similar to the}} Hurricanes primary logo, along with the team colors of red, black and silver. The banners at {{the top and bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> are inspired by the state flag of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|The image {{illustration}} and logo {{design was}} done by Yoshitaka Amano, who was brought on {{at the beginning of}} the game's production and designged <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> based on the game's themes. Several pieces of Amano's original artwork were retained and used in promotion when the game changed from Versus XIII to XV. In contrast to other major parts of the game, <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> artwork survived almost unchanged aside from its coloring. Amano also designed a new version of <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> that faded in during the game's ending, collaborating with the development team on its use. According to Tabata, the new logo signified the beginning of a new journey, and also representing the game's development since it was known as Versus XIII.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> Jesus Christ is God in self-revelation (Light) and {{redemption}} (Life). He is God {{to the extent}} that he can be present to man and knowable to man. <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is God, ... Yet <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> is in some sense distinguishable from God, for [...] "the Logos was with God". God and <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> are not two beings, and yet they are also not simply identical. ... <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is God active in creation, revelation, {{and redemption}}.|$|R
50|$|Plato's Theory of Forms {{was located}} within <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> also acted {{on behalf of}} God in the {{physical}} world. In particular, the Angel of the Lord in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was identified with <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> by Philo, who also said that <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> was God's instrument {{in the creation of}} the universe.|$|R

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, <b>the</b> term <b>logos</b> meant <b>the</b> {{principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to}} the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b>|$|R

5|$|The team's {{original}} alternate logo was {{the foot}} of a Sasquatch/Bigfoot and was seen on the shoulders of the Avalanche's home and away jerseys. <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, {{prior to the start of}} the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme. <b>The</b> <b>logo</b> will be featured on a patch located on the shoulders of the team's uniforms, along with a 20th anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.|$|E

5|$|To further complicate this controversy, {{many feel}} that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of {{stereotyping}} varies depending upon {{the name of the}} team, <b>the</b> <b>logo,</b> the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when <b>the</b> <b>logo</b> and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series of}} {{statements}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> at <b>the</b> {{very beginning of}} the Gospel of John build on each other. The statement that <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> existed [...] "at the beginning" [...] asserts that as Logos Jesus was an eternal being like God. The statement that <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> was [...] "with God" [...] asserts the distinction of Jesus from God. The statement that <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> [...] "was God" [...] states the unity of Jesus with God, thus stating his divinity.|$|R
50|$|Photinus {{denied that}} <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> as <b>the</b> Wisdom of God had an {{existence}} {{of its own}} before the birth of Christ. For Socinus, Christ was <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> but he denied His pre-existence; He was the Word of God as being His Interpreter (interpres divinae voluntatis). Nathaniel Lardner and Joseph Priestley considered <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> a personification of God's wisdom.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is <b>the</b> {{rational}} creative {{principle that}} permeates the universe. Since God eternally manifests himself, <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> is likewise eternal. He forms {{a bridge between}} the created and uncreated, and only through him, as the visible representative of divine wisdom, can the inconceivable and incorporeal God be known. Creation came into existence only through <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> and God's nearest approach to the world is the command to create. While <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> is substantially a unity, he comprehends a multiplicity of concepts, so that Origen terms him, in Platonic fashion, [...] "essence of essences" [...] and [...] "idea of ideas".|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{concept of}} <b>Logos</b> in Sufism {{is used to}} relate the [...] "Uncreated" [...] (God) to the [...] "Created" [...] (man). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be {{possible}} without <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is [...] "unique" [...] within each region. Jesus and Muhammad are seen as the personifications of <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> {{and this is what}} enables them to speak in such absolute terms.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>the</b> term <b>Logos</b> is not {{retained}} as a title {{beyond the}} prologue, the whole book of John presses these basic claims. As <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> Jesus Christ is God in self-revelation (Light) and redemption (Life). He is God {{to the extent}} that he can be present to man and knowable to man. <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is God, as Thomas stated: [...] "My Lord and my God." [...] Yet <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> is in some sense distinguishable from God, for [...] "the Logos was with God." [...] God and <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> are not two beings, and yet they are also not simply identical. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> God can be conceived (in principle at least) also apart from his revelatory action─although we must not forget that the Bible speaks of God only in his revelatory action. The paradox that <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> is God and yet it is in some sense distinguishable from God is maintained in the body of the Gospel. That God as he acts and as he is revealed does not [...] "exhaust" [...] God as he is, is reflected in sayings attributed to Jesus: [...] "I and the Father are one" [...] and also, [...] "the Father is greater than I." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is God active in creation, revelation, and redemption. Jesus Christ not only gives God's Word to us humans; he is the Word. [...] He is the true word─ultimate reality revealed in a Person. <b>The</b> <b>Logos</b> is God, distinguishable in thought yet not separable in fact. This was decreed at the First Council of Constantinople (381).|$|R

5000|$|Post-apostolic Christian writers {{struggled}} {{with the question of}} the identity of Jesus and <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> but <b>the</b> Church’s doctrine never changed that Jesus was <b>the</b> <b>Logos.</b> Each of <b>the</b> first six councils defined Jesus Christ as fully God and fully human, from the First Council of Nicea (325) to the Third Council of Constantinople (680-681). Christianity did not accept the Platonic argument that the spirit is good and the flesh is evil, and that therefore the man Jesus could not be God. Neither did it accept any of the Platonic beliefs that would have made Jesus something less than fully God and fully human at the same time. The original teaching of John’s gospel is, [...] "In the beginning was <b>the</b> <b>Logos,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> was with God, and <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> was God.... And <b>the</b> <b>Logos</b> became flesh and dwelt among us." [...] The final Christology of Chalcedon (confirmed by Constantinople III) was that Jesus Christ is both God and man, and that these two natures are inseparable, indivisible, unconfused, and unchangeable.|$|R
