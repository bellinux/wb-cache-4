5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is punctuated by a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello.

5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score to match <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>of</b> the Schubert Mass, {{in order for}} the music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, {{after taking}} up his post as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, Bach set {{the text of}} the Magnificat in a twelve {{movement}} composition in <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>of</b> E-flat major. For a performance at Christmas he inserted four hymns (laudes) related to that feast. This version, including the Christmas interpolations, was given the number BWV 243a in the catalogue of Bach's works.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the general}} method {{to compute the}} inverse square root was to {{calculate}} an approximation for , then revise that approximation via another method until it came within an acceptable error range of the actual result. Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>of</b> the fast inverse square root was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the square root with another method and calculating the reciprocal via floating point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit floating point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other floating point specifications.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Cantillon became {{involved}} with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract <b>The</b> <b>Key</b> <b>of</b> Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply {{would lead to the}} employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the Banque Générale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance their debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque Générales virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the tonic or dominant, but in the subdominant. The second, B part, {{continues}} to modulate by ascending fourths, until it reaches <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>of</b> D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local subdominant (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first in the major mode, then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the tonic and the opening section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the tonic minor in the sonata.|$|E
