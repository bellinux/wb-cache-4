5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging.

5|$|A 16th-century water gate in {{the eastern}} wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to {{the shore of the}} loch. The {{adjacent}} buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.|$|E

5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|CR115 {{begins at}} the Tioga County line {{in the town of}} Caroline, where it connects to Tioga County's CR33. The county highway passes a {{mountain}} to the west and the Owego River's west branch to the east as it heads northward. It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville, a small community located on top of a mountain. Here, CR115 turns to the northwest to run along <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> valley surrounding Boyer Creek. The creek reaches its source at an intersection with Yaple Road; however, CR115 continues northwestward to serve the hamlet of Caroline Center.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
50|$|Bactrosaurus was {{originally}} described as lacking a crest, {{which would be}} typical for an iguanodont, but anomalously primitive for a lambeosaurine like itself. However subsequent study of Bactrosaurus remains uncovered pieces of {{what appear to be}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incompletely preserved crest.|$|R
50|$|E. hardeniana {{trees have}} pale lichen covered bark {{typical of many}} species in the Warm Temperate Rainforests. Often <b>a</b> ring <b>of</b> coppice shoots {{surrounds}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult tree, coppice and seedling leaves have spiny marginal teeth, while adult leaves have no teeth.|$|R
50|$|Alluvial placers {{are those}} formed in river or stream sediments.

5|$|During a 12-day {{trade mission}} in Asia, Daniels visited Indiana {{soldiers}} {{serving on the}} border of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. On the 56th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, he laid a bouquet of white flowers at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plaque listing 900 soldiers from Indiana who died in the war. During the visit he met with Asian auto executives and successfully promoted the expansion of facilities in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E

5|$|NY210 commences at the New York–New Jersey {{state line}} {{in the town of}} Warwick, where it connects to CR511 in Passaic County, New Jersey. Like CR511 in New Jersey, NY210 is the primary lakeside roadway along Greenwood Lake, an interstate lake located roughly equally in New Jersey and New York. NY210 heads north from the state line along the western edge of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep valley {{surrounding}} the lake to a community known as Indian Park, entirely situated on the steep incline leading away from the lake. The route continues on to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, located at the northern tip of the lake.|$|E
5|$|NY333 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with CR11 and CR24 in Risingville, an isolated hamlet within the Steuben County town of Thurston. It headed eastward, following Michigan Creek along <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> valley surrounding the waterway. Due to {{the terrain of}} the area, NY333 intersected {{only a handful of}} roads, one of which was Cranberry Lake Road (CR2), a north–south highway that met NY333 midway between the hamlets of Risingville and Thurston. The route continued onward, turning northeastward toward Thurston Pond and the small hamlet of Thurston at {{the eastern edge of the}} small lake. Here, NY333 curved back to the east as it met Savona–Thurston Road (CR12) in the western half of the community.|$|E
5|$|NY380 {{began at}} the modern {{intersection}} of NY60 and CR44 in the Ellicott community of Kimball Stand. The route proceeded west along modern CR44 {{to what is now}} CR380, where it turned north to join the current alignment of CR380. NY380 left the vicinity of Kimball Stand and headed northwest along <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> valley surrounding Cassadaga Creek to the hamlet of Towerville, where it intersected with CR59 and CR48. After leaving Towerville, Route380 went northward into the town of Ellery. Here, it intersected CR52 and CR66 in Redbird, a community in the extreme northeastern corner of the town.|$|E

5|$|Past Richburg, NY275 {{continues}} on a northeasterly track through the rural town of Wirt, running along <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narrow, largely undeveloped valley surrounding Little Genesee Creek as East Notch Road. The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting {{with the western}} terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on its way toward East Notch, a gap between two large hills that serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
