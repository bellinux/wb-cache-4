5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said <b>that...</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking at the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, on March 26, 2011, Gingrich said, [...] "I {{have two}} grandchildren—Maggie is 11, Robert is 9. I am {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not decisively win {{the struggle over}} the nature of America, by the time they're my age {{they will be in}} a secular atheist country, potentially one dominated by radical Islamists and with no understanding of what it once meant to be an American." [...] He referred to his decision to seek office again, pointing to a 2002 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the phrase [...] "under God" [...] in the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional, saying, [...] "I had been watching the courts grow steadily more secular and steadily more anti-religious starting with the 1963 school prayer decision. But for some reason this particular decision struck me as so blindingly stupid, so profoundly un-American." [...] He added, [...] "Bravery will come from our churches, our synagogues, everyday folks. It won't come from the elites. It won't [...] those currently in power because if it could have come from them, it would have." ...|$|E

5000|$|We in TRADOC...decided {{to put the}} TOW on the MICV because <b>we</b> {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not put the TOW on the MICV, {{we would}} probably never have a MICV. General Don Starry, Army magazine, 1987.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not lay hands on him before that given hour, {{that he will}} be on the ramparts at the Angelus to-morrow," [...] said Chauvelin emphatically.|$|E
60|$|And we have {{to follow}} her, knowing, if we are {{experienced}} children, that the chances are that we shall never come that way to-morrow; or <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> the roses will be dead.|$|E

60|$|I {{pointed out}} that Oro had said we must obey at the peril of our lives; indeed that he had put it even more strongly, using words to the effect <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not he would kill us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean it, señor. Maria and I {{are quite}} agreed that we don't want any larger house {{than we have}} got; and I know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> want a big one, there would be all sorts of {{questions}} as to where I had got the money from." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening the}} trader started {{on his return}} journey to the coast, leaving us in charge of King Jambai, who promised earnestly to {{take good care of}} us. We {{immediately}} put his willingness to fulfil his promise to the test by begging him to furnish us with men to carry our goods into the interior. He tried very hard to induce us to change our minds and remain hunting with his tribe, telling us that the gorilla country was far far away from his lands; that we should never reach it alive, or <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> should certainly be killed by the natives, who, besides being cruel and warlike, were cannibals; and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> meet in with gorillas we should all be certainly slain, for no one could combat successfully with that ferocious giant of the monkey tribe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{are going}} to leave them in the care of the captain, with a note saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not turn up again before Ladysmith is relieved, they are to be handed over to the poor beggars there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only, Baas, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to be killed in this place from which there is no escape, it is {{necessary}} that you should find out exactly on what day and at what hour Dogeetah is going to arrive." ...|$|E
6000|$|But it {{is equally}} true <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not love them, we shall never {{understand}} them.

2500|$|In her review, Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "The Vietcong {{are treated}} in the {{standard}} inscrutable-evil Oriental style of the Japanese in the Second World War movies... The impression a viewer gets is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> some bad things there <b>we</b> <b>did</b> them ruthlessly but impersonally; the Vietcong were cruel and sadistic." ...|$|R
6000|$|I protested <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{it was our}} clear duty to pay a small rent; but Mrs. Evelegh brushed that aside.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} I {{hope and}} believe," [...] Rupert said. [...] "Well, Easton, {{how do you like}} the Guards, and how do you like campaigning? I see that you have given up white shirts, like the rest of us.

At any rate, it is pretty certain <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> fall, it will be with odds against us; but of course, as aides-de-camp our chance is a good deal better than that of regimental officers.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady!" [...] cried Mr Crimble, as if shocked, [...] "is it wise {{to attempt}} it? It must be admitted, of course, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not take {{advantage}} of the benefits bestowed upon us by Providence in a Christian community, we cannot escape His displeasure. The absence from His Love." ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{we do not}} {{understand}} our fellow-creatures we shall never love them. And it is equally true, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not love them we shall never understand them.

6000|$|... "We {{have our}} duty to do in Ireland, {{and we have been}} too long away from it already. My husband has his business, and I have my home, and they are both going to rack and ruin. Besides," [...] she added slyly, [...] "it is just {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> come to the States we might not find you there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of <b>that.</b> But, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> had better wait until to-morrow morning. You can't see much in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So Mamma thought,' said Elizabeth; 'but {{then she}} recollected <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> and not Harriet, Mrs. Hazleby would be mortally offended; {{and when we}} came to reckon, it {{appeared}} that there would be thirteen without us, and then Papa and I persuaded her, that it would be much less uncivil to leave out all the Misses, than to take one and leave the rest. You know Anne and I are both under seventeen yet, so that nobody will expect to see us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt the}} {{work will be}} dangerous, as well as hard but, as we know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not succeed all our lives are forfeited, we can face the danger. Everyone of us will take his share in turn; I shall do so, myself, and shall direct the work in general. What {{do you think of}} the plan?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{conception}} {{they will}} have of that purpose will necessarily determine their ethical scheme. It follows manifestly <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> really believe in Almighty God, the more strenuously and successfully we seek in ourselves and His world to understand the order and progress of things, and the more clearly we apprehend His purpose, the more assured and systematic will our ethical basis become.|$|E
60|$|But still, I cannot {{but believe}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{go on in}} prosperity, {{careless}} and unthankful, we are running into danger; {{we are likely to}} bring down on ourselves some sorrow or anxiety which will teach us, which at least is meant to teach us--from whom all good things come; and to know that the Lord has given, when the Lord has taken away.|$|E
6000|$|STRANGWAY. We're told otherwise. But come here! [Drawing {{him to the}} window] Look! Listen! To {{sleep in}} <b>that!</b> Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> it won't be so bad, Jack, will it? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could <b>do</b> a 400 cc {{bike that}} was 18 percent lighter, {{we should be}} able to do the same with a 750", recalls Mr. Yokouchi.|$|R
40|$|As {{early as}} the {{beginning}} of the 1970 s, during the first moves towards normalisation, when a whole series of institutional platforms in the church and in public life were being liquidated, and when it was becoming taboo to talk about political issues, Jan Capek reminded us that it was our duty not to abandon our responsibility for public life. He was afraid <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> it would harm the very basis of our faith, and the positions which we had held up till then would be discredited. He realised <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> ignore this responsibility, then it would also mean that our intellectual work would gradually waste away and the universal perspective of our responsibility would be lost, because theological debate, if confined purely to church circles, would gradually take on the character of a private interest. This warning was a serious one, which remained relevant in the years that followed. Were we {{going to be able to}} find a sense of direction in a period when, after the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops, prospects for the eastern type of civilisation reforming itself seemed quite minimal? Was there still any point in trying to improve conditions in a country which, after the promising reform movement of the 1960 s...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it was British {{impatience with}} other people's regulations. In a way, we are rather an arrogant lot, and it flatters our self-importance to know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{get into trouble}} our Consuls will {{probably}} save us from the punishment we deserve. You cannot lock up a drunken British sailor without inquiries being made. Don Arnoldo's people {{are proud of their}} army, but our fleet is ubiquitous." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the good}} old man {{received}} his present, he was much affected. [...] "I will accept what you offer me," [...] he said; [...] "for if I did not, I know your feelings would be wounded. But you must keep one of the nuts for yourselves. And, more than <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not find Apple Island {{in the course of}} the coming year, I invite you all to spend Christmas before last over again, with me at my son's house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> but hold together, we need not be afraid of this big bully. If we all declare {{to each other and}} swear that, the first time he strikes one of us, we will all set upon him; my faith on it, we shall be able to master him, big as he is. We are all of good size, and in two years will think {{ourselves}} men; therefore it would be shame, indeed, if the four of us could not master one, however big and sturdy he may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|Weighed {{in such a}} sacrilegious balance, Thomas {{was found}} wanting, of course: the idea of driving three or four miles farther to see an old tower, {{supposed}} to have belonged {{to a man who}} is supposed to have existed and to have been carried off by a supposititious Queen of the Fairies into Elfland, was too absurd for reasonable people; in fact, I made believe myself that I did not care much about it, particularly as the landlady remarked, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not get home by five o'clock [...] "the chops might be spoiled." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{advice was}} so {{reasonable}} {{that we all}} approved of it; and accordingly we calculated {{that we were able}} to carry provisions for forty-two days, but that we could not carry water for above twenty days, though we were to suppose it to stink, too, before that time expired. So <b>that</b> <b>we</b> concluded <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not come at some water in ten days' time, we would return; but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> found a supply of water, we could then travel twenty-one days; and, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> saw no end of the wilderness in that time, we would return also.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 May 2011, Dorries {{appeared}} {{to suggest that}} a lack of awareness of abstinence as a sexual choice among young girls is linked to rates of child sexual abuse. Dorries stated: [...] "If a stronger 'just say no' message was given to children in school, there might be an impact on sex abuse, because a lot of girls, when sex abuse takes place don't realise until later that was a wrong thing to do... I don't think people realise <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> empower this message into girls, imbued this message in school, we would probably have less sex abuse".|$|R
