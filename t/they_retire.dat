5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

25|$|All British police dogs, {{irrespective}} of the discipline they are trained in, must be licensed to work operationally. To obtain the license they have to pass a test {{at the completion of}} their training, and then again every year until <b>they</b> <b>retire,</b> which is usually at about the age of 8. The standards required to become operational are laid down by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) sub-committee on police dogs and are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that training and licensing reflects the most appropriate methods and standards.|$|E

25|$|The burrows of a {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombat can have air temperatures around of 14°C in midwinter to 26°C in midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to around 2°C in Winter and up to 36°C or above during Summer. Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the wombat. A wombat retires deep in the burrow after foraging. The next night, the wombat moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again. In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, <b>they</b> <b>retire.</b>|$|E
25|$|In theory, the National Command of {{the party}} is the {{embryonic}} government for the entire Arab nation. The body comprises 21 members, half of whom are Syrian. In practice, the Syrian Regional Command is the more powerful institution inside the party. The Syrian Regional Command is the real political leadership in Syria; {{the power of the}} National Command has become more symbolic than real. A seat in National Command has become a sinecure, an honorary post given to Syrian politicians as <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> from active political life. Hafez al-Assad rarely had time to attend National Command meetings. Instead, he appointed Vice President for Party Affairs Zuhayr Mashariqa or Abd al-Halim Khaddam to represent him at National Command meetings. In theory, the National Command could conduct proselytism and form new Regional Commands across the Arab world and support weaker Regional Commands, but Syrian policymakers have curtailed that capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Pandavas, who {{had ruled}} their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> to the Himalaya and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with them. One {{by one the}} {{brothers}} and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishthira gives the rest the reason for their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of their looks, and Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhishthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja), and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining {{the nature of the}} test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.|$|E

25|$|Hawkeye remains {{with the}} Avengers for {{numerous}} adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar {{to defeat the}} Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership {{of the first generation}} of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, Graviton, and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house. Brian gets the final word — [...] "Hey, I fucked your dad." [...] — and angrily slams the door shut.|$|E

Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day.

[...] Their homes are [...] "coral caves underneath the waves" [...] to which <b>they</b> <b>retire</b> at sunset and rising tide, {{as well as in}} anticipation of storms. When one mermaid tries to pull Wendy into the water and drown her, Peter intervenes and hissesrather than crowsat them and they quickly dive into the water and disappear.

The Mermaids' Lagoon is a favourite [...] "adventure" [...] for the children, and where they take their [...] "midday meal". Peter gives Wendy one of the mermaid's combs as a gift.|$|E
