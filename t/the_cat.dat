5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E

5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to <b>the</b> <b>cat,</b> promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> in the Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> leave. <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

30|$|All {{teachers}} used {{at least}} 11 out of 13 CATs in their practice. They all made changes in <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> {{and did not}} do exactly what was suggested in the teacher guide of <b>the</b> <b>CATs.</b> <b>The</b> reason for this was that they already had lesson plans for each lesson in Chapter 1 before the first meeting took place. These lesson plans were very detailed. For example, they described the number of exercises the teachers should do in each class and the time {{it would cost to}} do these exercises. Because the teachers had already a very clear picture of {{what they were going to}} do in class, they had to merge <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> into their lesson plans. They did this very carefully in order to complete their pre-arranged activities and at the same time benefit from trying out <b>the</b> <b>CATs.</b> One of <b>the</b> changes the teachers reported most often was reducing the number of tasks in <b>the</b> <b>CATs.</b> <b>The</b> teachers considered some tasks in <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> to be redundant and did not like to repeat a “similar” task. A second change the teachers often made was carrying out <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> in a time slot before or after class, like in morning reading sessions or self-study lessons, instead of during class. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> would not take “precious” time from the mathematics class. The teachers were very concerned about the shortage of time in class. Adding extra instruction or help during carrying out <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> was a third change often made by the teachers. Also, it was found that the teachers from the same school made the same changes in <b>the</b> <b>CATs,</b> which was not such a surprise because in the meetings the teachers discussed with each other how to use <b>the</b> <b>CATs.</b>|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{teachers}} did not use <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> for informed decision-making about their further teaching, they were quite positive in their evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> as a way to reveal their students’ understanding of division. They found <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> helpful for knowing more about their students’ learning and difficulties because the questions differed from those in the textbook. Particularly, the teachers valued <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> with <b>the</b> red/green cards format for the opportunity they provide to quickly obtain information about students’ understanding and engage students. Moreover, the teachers acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> gave them insight in what content and skills their students should learn and how to teach these.|$|R

30|$|To {{inform the}} {{teachers}} about <b>the</b> <b>CATs,</b> a teacher guide was developed describing for each CAT its purpose, {{how and when}} {{it can be used}} in class, and issues on which teachers can focus when observing and checking students’ responses. The teacher guide of <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> also provided some general background information about formative assessment and <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>CATs.</b> Although detailed instructions were given for using <b>the</b> <b>CATs,</b> <b>the</b> teacher guide of <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> was not meant as a fixed recipe for what to do in class. Instead the teachers could adapt <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> to their own needs, which is in line with the finding of Lee and Wiliam (2005) that having teachers decide for themselves about the use of assessment techniques is crucial for the success of their use. Thus, to enhance the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>CATs</b> and stimulate ownership, the teachers could freely decide which CATs to use, when, and in what way.|$|R
