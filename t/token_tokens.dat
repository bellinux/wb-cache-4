The first application “FILES ” – Fully Integrated Linguistic Environment for Syntactic and Functional Annotation- is a prototype for a fully integrated linguistic environment for syntactic functional annotation of corpora. It takes as input tagged and disambiguated tokenized texts, a file containing the same text split into sentences, and a files containing the morphosyntactic and semantic features associated to each tagged <b>token.</b> <b>Tokens</b> may be aither single words, polywords, abbreviations or punctuation marks. An as yet separated module of “FILES ” is the syntactic constituency annotation environment which uses a shallow parser on the same tagged files and produces a fully bracketed output where each sentence is a record. Files contaning bracketed sentences are given as input to Syntactic Constituency Annotation Tool “SCAT” for manual verification. ...|$|E

Data from naturally-occur-ring conversations by 56 children and adults of both sexes are analyzed within Myers-Scotton’s (1993 [1997], 2002) Matrix Language Frame model. Eight language types were identified, including monolingual Spanish and English turns, codeswitched turns, and turns showing convergence (morpheme strings from one language with some grammatical structure from the other). An instance of each language type per turn was counted as a token of that language type. Each sentence of a multisentence turn was counted as a separate <b>token.</b> <b>Tokens</b> of each type were counted per informant.

40|$|Abstract — There is {{widespread}} agreement that {{a higher level}} programming model for sensor networks is needed. A variety of models have been developed, but the community is far from consensus. We propose an intermediate language {{to speed up the}} exploration of this design space. Our language, called the Token Machine Language (TML) can be targeted by compilers for higher level systems. TML provides a layer of abstraction for a lower-level runtime environment, such as TinyOS. TML is intended to capture coordinated activity in a sensor network. Notable features of TML are its atomic action model of concurrency, and its unification of communication, control, and storage around the concept of a <b>token.</b> <b>Tokens</b> are small objects, typically under a hundred bytes, and can be disseminated across the network. A token causes computation upon its arrival at a site by invoking a token handler. The effect of the computation is to atomically change the token’s own state as well as the state of shared variables at the site. I...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen girls (ages 4, 6, 9, and 12) {{performed}} on concurrent-chain schedules of reinforcement. The initial links were variable-interval 10 -s schedules, and the terminal links offered a long delay (20, 30, 40, or 50 s) {{followed by two}} tokens or a short delay (10 s) followed by one <b>token.</b> <b>Tokens</b> were used to buy toys and sweets. The effect of increasing the delay to the large reward differed significantly across age groups. Whereas 6 - and 9 -year-olds maintained a strong preference for the larger, more delayed reward under all delay conditions, half of the 4 -year-olds and all the 12 -year-olds showed increasing preference for the small reward as the delay to the large reward increased. The results suggest a two-stage account {{of the development of}} self-control. In the first stage, behavior is increasingly controlled by reward size, as children learn how to wait for delayed rewards, and in the second phase behavior is increasingly controlled by reward rate, as children learn when it is in fact profitable to wait...|$|E
40|$|OAuth {{enables a}} {{third-party}} application to obtain {{limited access to}} a protected resource, either {{on behalf of a}} resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This document defines how an application client uses credentials obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to access a protected resource at a resource server. Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols. Clients typically store the user’s long-term credential. This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks. A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a shared secret with higher entropy, i. e., the <b>token.</b> <b>Tokens</b> typically provide limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user’s long-term password.

40|$|An ad-hoc {{sensor network}} is {{a network of}} {{numerous}} wireless nodes where each node has sensing, storage, computation, communication and possibly actuating resources. Each node has a limited power source that determines the lifetime of the node. Therefore, energy is the most critical factor in sensor networks {{in all of its}} design levels (i. e. hardware, network layers and applications). Numerous studies in sensor networks have already demonstrated that communication between nodes is the dominating source of energy consumption. While traditional wireless network architecture has been based on systems of static base stations, it appears that a multi-hop network, where each node communicates with a few close nodes, is most efficient in terms of energy savings and bandwidth reuse. In multi-hop networks, each node communicates with other geographically distant nodes using intermediate nodes to build a communication path. The goal of this research introduces and evaluates new power saving techniques for wireless ad-hoc sensor networks. In order to present the flow of the algorithms within the network, we introduce the notion of a <b>token.</b> <b>Token(s)</b> defines a node that is currently active and is executing the algorithm. The procedures involve electing the next active node and giving the control of the algorithms (token...|$|E
