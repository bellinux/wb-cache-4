25|$|When he debuted, he sang {{old school}} pop and {{acoustic}} R ballads. Starting from Revolution (公轉自轉), Wang began to test out R pop music, but quickly jumped to a quirky style of dance-pop for Impossible <b>to</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>You</b> (不可能錯過你). Starting from Forever's First Day (永遠的第一天), he began composing rock songs with heavy electric guitar melodies and {{less emphasis on}} dance-pop. Nonetheless, he still concentrated in light R music. The One and Only (唯一) became his only fully produced rock album.|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} his studies by attending Berklee College of Music's Professional Music program, with voice as his principal instrument. In 1999, Wang released his sixth album Impossible <b>to</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>You,</b> which combined the catchy pop melodies of Revolution with a quirky style of new-found dance-pop. It became his then best-selling album, selling over 1 million copies. All of the album's promotional singles topped KTV charts and yearly music charts, including the upbeat [...] "Julia" [...] and the ballad [...] "Crying Palm". His album also attracted international attention–Wang won three Best Male Vocalist awards at three different award ceremonies {{and was also}} awarded for his musical merit in the album at the 1st annual Asia Chinese Music Awards.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{lift your}} hat and come away, while you receive Lou's cheery [...] "See you again," [...] and the sardonic, sweet smile of Nancy that seems, somehow, <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>you</b> and go {{fluttering}} {{like a white}} moth up over the housetops to the stars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I don't like <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>you,</b> {{even for}} a day.

6000|$|He had stopped, {{leaving his}} friend to wonder a little what point {{he wished to}} make; and this it was that enabled Strether {{meanwhile}} to make one. [...] "Oh we've never pretended to go into detail. We weren't in the least bound to THAT. It was 'filling out' enough <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>you</b> as we did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't often {{give these}} festivities," [...] he went on, [...] "but you don't come home once in twelve years every day, Annie.

She {{wanted me to go}} with her; but I could not bring myself to go with her to-day. It's useless for the body to go out, when the heart still remains at home. Don't you find it so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother would}} have wished it," [...] she said, [...] "and she sent {{me as soon as}} she knew who it was. You mustn't be distressed," [...] she entreated, with a pathetic smile.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Victor dubiously; [...] "it {{seems to}} me rather hard {{to give up my}} chance of the first grizzly I've ever seen.

6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] the Marquis murmured, {{ringing the}} bell. [...] "You {{will return to}} lunch, of course? I shall take no denial.
