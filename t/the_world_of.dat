5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Continent at the base, <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Ocean on the 5th floor, <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Sky on the 10th, and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Continent's older races.|$|E
