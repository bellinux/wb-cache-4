40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several {{clinical}} studies have {{given rise to}} optimism about low-dose steroid treatment in patients with sepsis. It reduces time to shock reversal and may even {{have a positive effect on}} mortality. The pathophysiology of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome has not yet been determined, and the usefulness of basal and stimulated cortisol levels in diagnosing this syndrome is still uncertain. This review will examine recent evidence to elucidate these questions. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies performed in more than 1000 patients in intensive care show convincingly that in general serum cortisol levels are increased. Basal or stimulated cortisol levels are at best useful to predict mortality in patients in intensive care, not to decide which patients to treat or when <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> treatment. <b>Measuring</b> free cortisol concentrations rather than total cortisol concentrations in critically ill patients may lead to new research strategies to identify the mode of action of low-dose steroid treatment. SUMMARY: It has been shown that low-dose corticosteroid administration to catecholamine-dependent patients in septic shock results in shock reversal. There seems to be a relative shortage of cortisol, because low-dose hydrocortisone administration resulting in cortisol levels as much as four times the already increased levels results in shock reversal. Strong evidence for a positive effect on mortality is still lacking, perhaps because of the relatively low number of patients investigated. A very important topic in interpreting studies is that total (free plus protein-bound) cortisol has been measured. Future studies should also measure free cortisol concentrations, which could add to our knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome. On the basis of current knowledge, there is no evidence to support a treatment strategy based on a random or stimulated cortisol level. At the moment, rapid hemodynamic improvement of catecholamine-dependent patients after the administration of low-dose corticosteroids still seems the best available clue to diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{preprocessing}} circuit for ISFETs (Ion-sensitive field-effecttransistors) {{to measure}} hydrogen-ion concentration in electrolyte is presented. A modifiedflip-flop {{is the main}} part of the circuit. The modification consists in replacing the standardtransistors by ISFETs and periodically switching the supply voltage on and off. Concentration of hydrogen ions <b>to</b> be <b>measured</b> <b>discontinues</b> the flip-flop value symmetry,which means that by switching the supply voltage on the flip-flop goes to one of two stablestates, Ã¢Â€Â˜oneÃ¢Â€Â™ or Ã¢Â€Â˜zeroÃ¢Â€Â™. The recovery of the value symmetry can be achieved by changing abalanced voltage, which is incorporated to the flip-flop, to bring the flip-flop to a 50 %position (probability of Ã¢Â€Â˜oneÃ¢Â€Â™ equals to probability of Ã¢Â€Â˜zeroÃ¢Â€Â™). Thus, the balanced voltagereflects the measured concentration of hydrogen ions. Its magnitude is set automatically byusing a feedback circuit whose input is connected to the flip-flop output. The preprocessingcircuit, as the whole, is the well-known ÃŽÂ´ modulator in which the switched flip-flop servesas a comparator and a sampling circuit. The advantages of this approach in comparison tothose of standard approaches are discussed. Finally, theoretical results are verified bysimulations with TSPICE and a good agreement is reported...|$|R

30|$|Our {{results showed}} that the women most likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> any {{endocrine}} therapy before five years were those who did not undergo chemotherapy or mastectomy. This finding remained after adjusting for treatment by a medical oncologist. Previous studies have reported that women not undergoing chemotherapy or mastectomy are more likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> therapy early. A large observational study of 8769 women followed for 4.5  years found that women undergoing chemotherapy before commencing endocrine therapy were significantly less likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> than other women, and those who had undergone mastectomy were less likely <b>to</b> <b>discontinue</b> than those who had a lumpectomy (Hershman et al. 2010). A shorter-term study (1  year follow-up) of > 13, 000 women also reported that women with pre-endocrine therapy mastectomy had nearly half the probability of non-adherence compared with women without mastectomy (Sedjo and Devine 2011). It may be that women who undergo more ‘aggressive’ treatments perceive their condition as more serious and their need for endocrine therapy greater, than other women.|$|R
