5|$|Folding@home {{is one of}} the world's fastest {{computing}} systems, with a {{speed of}} approximately 70 petaFLOPS. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 139 scientific research papers {{as a direct result of}} Folding@home. Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than the culmen, whereas it was four <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The family Balaenidae {{contains}} two genera and four species. All the Balaenidae whales have no ventral grooves; a distinctive head shape with a strongly arched, narrow rostrum, bowed lower jaw; lower lips that enfold {{the sides and}} front of the rostrum; long, narrow, elastic baleen plates (up to 9 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than wide) with fine baleen fringes; and fused cervical vertebrae rendering the head immobile.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, {{development}} {{was under way}} to create pixellated camouflage patterns for battledress like the Canadian Forces' CADPAT, issued in 2002, and then the US Marines' MARPAT, rolled out between 2002 and 2004. The CADPAT and MARPAT patterns were somewhat self-similar (in the manner of fractals and patterns in nature such as vegetation), being designed to work at two different scales; a genuinely fractal pattern would be statistically similar at all scales. A target camouflaged with MARPAT takes about 2.5 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> to detect than older NATO camouflage which worked at only one scale, while recognition, which begins after detection, took 20 percent longer than with older camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{can use the}} {{parallel}} computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in {{the same amount of}} time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> {{than most of}} their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic {{element of the}} alkali metal group, with a standard atomic weight of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties {{similar to those of}} other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, 85Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive 87Rb, with a half-life of 49billion years—more than three <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than the estimated age of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this probably has made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E

5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the movie, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and John Bruno {{were in charge}} of the project, which contained 400 effects shots. ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr., and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than those in the Predator films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E

5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his military career in the United States, and while he did not keep an ongoing record, he estimated that he had flown 89 combat missions. This number was disputed by the records of the Army Air Corps {{and other members of the}} 394th Bomber Squadron. For example, one pilot in the same bomb group as Roddenberry flew eighty missions, but took three <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than Roddenberry had claimed to do so. In October, he was assigned to Fort Worth, Texas and then the 18th Replacement Wing at Salt Lake City. He was subsequently moved to the Office of Flight Safety based in Oakland, California. In February 1944, he moved back to March Field and was promoted to Captain and subsequently flew all over the United States in his role as a plane crash investigator. During this time he was in another accident as a passenger on a military flight that crashed and caught fire. Roddenberry pulled three men to safety. During his military career, he was awarded the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 <b>times</b> <b>longer</b> than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
