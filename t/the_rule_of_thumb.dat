5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so unusual for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper {{provides}} {{the rationale for}} the Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs) for fat, saturated fat and other nutrients that appear on food labels in the UK. These GDAs are provided voluntarily by manufacturers and retailers and were developed to help people make better use of nutrition labelling [...] the format of which is prescribed by the European Union's nutrition labelling directive. The paper also describes the basis to some <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> for what counts as 'a lot' or 'a little' of fat, saturated fat and other nutrients, in an individual food. DESIGN: The paper gives the background to, and purpose <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> GDAs and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> and explains how they were calculated. It briefly describes their subsequent usage by food producers and others. RESULTS: Both GDAs and <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> first appeared in a leaflet developed by the authors and published in 1996 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. GDAs for fat, saturated fat and energy were adopted subsequently by the Institute of Grocery Distribution and then by many retailers and some manufacturers. <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> for fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium have recently been republished in some leaflets published by the Food Standards Agency in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: GDAs and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> may provide useful ways of helping consumers make sense of nutrition labelling.

40|$|Abstract: With {{foundations}} {{in scientific}} argumentation/discourse literature and transfer literature, this study describes {{the potential of}} a new ritualized and repeated classroom activity, <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> practice, in developing the conceptual understanding, scientific reasoning, and transfer ability of physical science students in project-based inquiry classrooms (e. g., Learning By Design). Teachers employ an experimental <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> practice with more or less fidelity to develop student science talk (defined as the skill or act of communicating and explaining, both in written and/or verbal form, the science concepts and principles within a context in an abstract, generalized form) using scaffolded, iterative instructional practices.

This paper {{presents the results of}} that analysis. <b>The</b> experimental <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> practice, which explicitly has students connect experienced phenomena with scientific explanations and then publicly iterate on the explanations, seems to have a positive effect in developing conceptual understanding, scientific reasoning, and transfer ability.

25|$|Passenger {{vessels in}} excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as cruise ships, pay a rate {{based on the number}} of berths, that is, the number of {{passengers}} that can be accommodated in permanent beds.

25|$|The same is true, up to a point, of the {{chemical}} reactions of living things.

The general {{aim was to}} explore and describe <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and to analyse the management of respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTI and UTI) in general practice in Sweden. The results are based upon focus group interviews concerning <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and a prospective diagnosis-prescription study concerning the management of patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI or UTI. In addition unpublished data are given from structured telephone interviews concerning specific <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> in acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. GPs were able to verbalize their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> which could be called tacit knowledge. A specific set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> was used for rapid assessment when emergency and psychosocial problems were identified. Somatic problems {{seemed to be the}} expected, normal state. In the further consultation <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> seemed to be used in an act of balance between the individual and the general perspective. There was considerable variation between <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>of</b> different GPs for patients with acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. In their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>the</b> GPs seemed to integrate their medical knowledge and practical experience of the consultation. A high number of near-patient antigen tests to probe Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A tests) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests were performed in patients, where testing was not recommended. There was only a slight decrease in antibiotic prescribing in patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI examined with CRP in comparison with patients not tested. In general, the GPs in Sweden adhered to current guidelines for antibiotic prescribing. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was the preferred antibiotic for most patients allocated a diagnosis of respiratory tract infection. In conclusion, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> might explain why current practices prevail in spite of educational efforts. One way to change practice could be to identify and evaluate <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> used by GPs and disseminate well adapted <b>rules.</b> <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> diagnostic tests in patients with infectious illnesses in general practice needs critical appraisal before introduction as well as continuing surveillance. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> by GPs might be one explanation for variation in practice and irrational prescribing of antibiotics in patients with infectious conditions.

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{has been}} {{employed as a}} means of assaying copper(II) samples, since the evolved I2 can be analyzed by redox titration. [...] The reaction in itself may look rather odd, as using <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> for a proceeding redox reaction, [...] Eooxidator−Eoreductor>0, this reaction fails. The quantity is below zero, so the reaction should not proceed. But the equilibrium constant=10^{(nox*nred/0.0591)*(Eooxidator−Eoreductor)} which in itself is easily derived from the Nernst equations for the specific half reactions. Using Eoox=EoCu2+/Cu+ = 0.15; nox = 1 for copper; Eored=EoI−/I2 = 0.52; nred = 2 for iodine for the reaction is 1.38*10−13. By using fairly moderate concentrates of 0.1mol/L for both iodide and Cu2+, the concentration of Cu+ is calculated as 3*10−7. As a consequence, the product of the concentrations is far in excess of the solubility product, so copper(I)iodide precipitates. The process of precipitation lowers the copper(I) concentration, providing an entropic driving force according to Le Chatelier's principle, and allowing the redox reaction to proceed.|$|E

Once above approximately a pressure of most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the [...] "climb-high, sleep-low" [...] approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp, climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells. [...] Once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude, the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is to ascend no more than [...] per day to sleep.
