30|$|ACL-injured knees of 52 {{patients}} were examined by two examiners and side-to-side differences were compared. Both lower legs were internally rotated by applying manual internal rotation torque to both feet in prone {{position with the}} knees in 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° of flexion. For quantification {{of the amount of}} rotation in degrees, a <b>torque</b> <b>adapter</b> on a booth was used. Intra-rater, inter-rater and rater-device agreement were determined by calculating kappa (κ) for the tibial internal rotation test.|$|E
30|$|Two {{independent}} examiners {{performed the}} dial test in knees of 52 patients after knee distorsion with a suspicion on ACL rupture. The dial test {{was performed in}} prone position in 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° of flexion of the knees. ≥ 10 ° side-to-side difference was considered a positive dial test. For quantification {{of the amount of}} rotation in degrees, a measuring device was used with a standardized 6  Nm force, using a digital <b>torque</b> <b>adapter</b> on a booth. The intra-rater, inter-rater and rater-device agreement were determined by calculating kappa (κ) for the dial test.|$|E
30|$|The {{head of an}} {{abutment}} screw is {{cut into}} a hexagon and pushed into and fixed to the hexagonal hole (for multi-unit abutments) of a machine driver. With this, a <b>torque</b> wrench <b>adapter</b> and <b>torque</b> wrench are assembled. A hand driver is rotated clockwise to the limit, and the torque value is read.|$|R
50|$|Borg-Warner/Quadra-Trac {{overdrive}} {{was available}} from early 1960 to 1969. The Borg-Warner overdrive case is 11¾ inches long (less <b>torque</b> tube <b>adapter,</b> if required), including the 1+1/2 in adapter. A complete T96 with overdrive is 18¾ inches long from front of case to end of tailshaft housing. The overdrive unit {{is the same}} for all.|$|R
40|$|Space {{technology}} utilization {{for developing}} tools, adapters, and fixtures {{and procedures for}} assembling, installing, and servicing electrical components and equipment are discussed. Some of the items considered are: (1) pivotal screwdriver, (2) termination locator tool for shielded cables, (3) solder application tools, (4) insulation and shield removing tool, and (5) <b>torque</b> wrench <b>adapter</b> for cable connector engaging ring. Diagrams of the various tools and devices are provided...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, owners {{left with}} cars with seized engines {{that were going}} nowhere were {{provided}} with a solution by the Hurley Engineering Company. They supplied a <b>torque</b> converter <b>adapter</b> plate and other fittings so that a Ford Essex V4 engine could be fitted in the space left by a removed rotary engine. It was the only engine short enough to fit in the vacated space without modification to the body work. Depending on which Ford model it came from, the engine was available with front or rear sump wells, crank pulley or timing case mounted cooling fan, two capacities and a low compression version for using low grade fuel. In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 and the rotary were like chalk and cheese compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later the Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, was thirsty and didn't quite have the right handling balance.|$|R
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a <b>torque</b> wrench tool <b>adapter</b> that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R
