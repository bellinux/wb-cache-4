5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> for Tissaphernes) greater and greater {{concessions}} of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E

25|$|In Reformed theology, the Word of God {{takes several}} forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him {{said to be}} found in the Old Testament and the {{ministry}} of the apostles who saw him and communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> through them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation. Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.|$|E
25|$|On the peninsula, {{the effects}} of the {{continued}} contacts between the non-Malays with Malay-dominated centre is suggested in a 19th-century account of Pahang, which mentions that some of the natives who had strong trading ties with the Malays had begun to emulate their speech and dress. The population of Pattani also has been described as partly aboriginal in origin. In the case of Johor, the aboriginal people who were reported in the 19th century <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> Aslian languages, were called 'Malay' a century later. It has been suggested that these people would probably have joined the Jakun first before becoming Malay. The Jakun are described as being similar to Malays in their kinship arrangements, but resistant to aspects of social structure as well as the Islamic religion of the Malays. In 17th century Cambodia, a polity renowned for its Buddhism, king Ramathipadi I converted to Islam, took the name Muhammad Ibrahim, married a Malay Muslim of a princely Cham family, had his courtiers wear krisses and used Malay language in correspondence. During the same century in Champa, a once powerful Indianized polity but by that time retreating before the advancing Vietnamese, the rulers held the title Paduka Seri Sultan which is so common in the Malay polities. These rulers were in close contact with the peninsula, in particular Kelantan. French missionaries reported the presence of scribes and religious scholars from Kelantan right into the 19th century. It was believed that Kelantanese who eventually helped to give the Cham struggle against the Vietnamese, the character of a religious crusade.|$|E

500|$|Barney {{was born}} in 1876 in Dayton, Ohio, to Albert Clifford Barney and Alice Pike Barney. Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, where their conversation changed the course of Alice's life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously, despite, years later, her husband's disapproval. She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
500|$|Several {{observers}} {{have noted that}} foreign journalists {{were not allowed to}} interview the self-immolation victims recovering in hospitals. Even the victims' relatives were not permitted to speak with them, according to David Ownby. [...] Pan wrote that [...] "Beijing denied requests to interview Liu Siying and the three other survivors, who are all hospitalized... A Kaifeng official said only China Central Television and the official New China News Agency were permitted to speak to their relatives or their colleagues. A man who answered the door at the Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview. Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E

500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty wellâ€”at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da drauÃŸen".|$|E

2500|$|On March 29, 1995, during congressional {{hearings}} on the US War on Drugs, Burton proclaimed that the US military [...] "should place an aircraft carrier {{off the coast of}} Bolivia and crop dust the coca fields." [...] It was later pointed out to him that (a) Bolivia is landlocked and has no coast (Burton was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee); (b) the Bolivian coca fields (in the yungas and Amazon lowlands) are beyond the reach of any carrier-borne crop-duster, being separated from the nearest coastline (the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile) by the 20,000+ feet high peaks of the Andes; and (c) F-18s cannot crop-dust. While criticism of this misstatement was muted in Washington, it sparked a major anti-American backlash in Bolivia, derailing the same War on Drugs that Burton purported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> for.|$|E

Between 1880 and 1892 Harcourt acted as Gladstone's political deputy. A first-rate party fighter, his services were of huge value. However, in spite of his great success as a platform speaker, he was generally felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>speaking</b> from an [...] "advocate's brief", and did not impress the public as a conviction politician. It was he who coined the phrase about [...] "stewing in Parnellite juice", and, when the split came in the Liberal party on the Irish question, even those who gave Gladstone and John Morley the credit of being convinced Home Rulers could not be persuaded that Harcourt had followed anything but the line of party expediency.|$|E
