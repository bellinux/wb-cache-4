25|$|The first {{physical}} sign {{of puberty}} in girls {{is usually a}} firm, tender lump under {{the center of the}} areola of one or both breasts, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age. This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and nipples forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.|$|E

500|$|While mass-classifiers do not {{necessarily}} bear any semantic relationship to the noun {{with which they are}} used (e.g. box and book are not related in meaning, but one can still say [...] "a box of books"), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects {{solely on the basis of}} inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and prototypical theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.|$|E

However, he was disappointed in the weak dialogue and the grammatical errors scattered throughout the book, especially the inclusion of [...] "glaringly out-of-place world" [...] words, thus having too many anachronism in the book. Rito Paul from Daily News and Analysis shared Khanna's opinion, while saying that the book [...] "is impressive in its conception. But it is executed poorly. [...] "We're thrust into the narrative, mid-action, exactly from where the first book ended. And the breathless pace of the action hardly ever lets up... There are more twists and turns than in a Gordian knot, and at least two revelations of the 'Luke-I-am-your-father' variety... And it really rankles, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> scope for flair, adventure and wonder in the world Tripathi has imagined... The Secrets is not a bad book.

Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011.

500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself.
