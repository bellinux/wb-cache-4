5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> during rainfall periods on the southern face of <b>the</b> <b>Alps.</b> This works both ways across <b>the</b> <b>alps</b> but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> (also called Napoleon Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> {{despite the}} {{existence}} of another, more well-known painting with that name) is an 1848–1850 oil-on-canvas portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte, by French artist Paul Delaroche. The painting depicts Bonaparte leading his army through <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> on a mule, a journey Napoleon and his army of soldiers made {{in the spring of}} 1800, in an attempt to surprise the Austrian army in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{contrast}} between Jacques-Louis David's {{depiction of the}} same scene (of Napoleon traversing <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> {{on his way to}} Italy), which was a flattering portrait that the king of Spain requested for Napoleon (as a gift) and Delaroche's depiction in Bonaparte Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> is easily apparent.|$|E

5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across <b>the</b> <b>alps</b> on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the time, because the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
50|$|Since his defeat, Johns has drifted from <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> and {{has been}} {{critical}} of his old party. Johns told Brett Evans that he might still {{be a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> but Evans says that in Johns' heart he has moved on from <b>the</b> <b>ALP.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Grison <b>Alps</b> are <b>the</b> {{mountains}} of the Graubünden canton of Switzerland (Grisons being the English {{name for the}} Graubünden region). There are many significant peaks in <b>the</b> Grison <b>Alps,</b> including <b>the</b> Tödi (3,614 m) and the highest peak, Piz Bernina (4,049 m). Many of the mountain ranges feature extensive glaciers, such as at the Adula, the Albula, the Silvretta, the Bernnina or the Rätikon range. <b>The</b> Grison <b>Alps</b> include parts of both <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Alps</b> and <b>the</b> Western <b>Alps.</b> <b>The</b> Eastern <b>Alps</b> located in Graubünden are <b>the</b> Rhaetian <b>Alps,</b> which is part to <b>the</b> Central Eastern <b>Alps.</b> <b>The</b> Rhaetian <b>Alps</b> consists of <b>the</b> following mountain ranges: Samnaun Alps, Rätikon, Silvretta, Sesvenna Range, Albula Range, Plessur Range, Oberhalbstein Range, Livigno Range, Bregaglia Range and the Bernina Range. <b>The</b> Western <b>Alps</b> located in Graubünden, include portions of <b>the</b> Lepontine <b>Alps</b> and <b>the</b> Glarus <b>Alps.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Romans {{occupied}} Martigny to {{the north}} of the massif, and their influence spread out well beyond <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> into much of northern Europe. As a result of aggressive pressure from tribes in the north, the imperial forces of Rome were gradually withdrawn from the alpine regions until, by the 5thcentury AD, they had left completely. The areas left behind were occupied in the western part by the Burgundian tribes from what is today France, whilst the Alemanni tribes from Germany moved into eastern parts, resulting in the linguistic divide found today across <b>the</b> <b>Alps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is {{difficult}} to determine exactly where they inhabit because of their similarity with P. alcon. In Western Europe they are thought to be concentrated in <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> and in Southern Europe.|$|E

5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat in <b>the</b> <b>alps</b> since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified. According to a report, this may have accelerated the retreat of glaciers in Europe which otherwise may have continued to expand until approximately the year 1910.|$|E
5|$|Delaroche's {{early works}} had {{been based on}} topics from the Bible's Old Testament, but {{gradually}} his interests switched to painting scenes from English and French history. He 'combined colouristic skill {{with an interest in}} detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche's career.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who {{resided in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and {{a veteran of}} <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> made the first attempt to ascend the {{mountain}} in 1866.

50|$|Under {{pressure}} from the federal executive of <b>the</b> <b>ALP,</b> <b>the</b> ILP was readmitted into <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> at a unity conference on 26 August 1939. Heffron and William McKell then successfully combined to depose Lang on 5 September 1939.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 he {{resigned}} from the NSW branch of <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> in protest at {{what he saw as}} the increasingly highly centralised nature of control over the operations of the organisation. He said that the administrative arm of <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> in NSW had become increasingly involved in policy formulation leaving little room for meaningful participation by rank and file members of <b>the</b> <b>ALP.</b> In August 2012 he rejoined <b>the</b> <b>ALP</b> in Canberra where he felt that local management of the party was more responsive to the concerns of rank and file members.|$|R
5|$|Elements of the cold, harsh {{environment}} of <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep cliff face appears on his left, {{and the path}} underfoot has {{a thick layer of}} ice.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{crossing}} of <b>the</b> <b>Alps,</b> Napoleon commenced military operations against the Austrian army.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>alp</b> is {{best known}} for its shapeshifting abilities, similar to the creatures from {{werewolf}} lore. It may change into a cat, pig, dog, snake or a small white butterfly. [...] It has also been said that it can fly like a bird and ride a horse. <b>The</b> <b>alp</b> always wears a hat, giving it an almost comical appearance. The hat is known as a Tarnkappe (the literal translation being [...] "camouflage cap" [...] or [...] "cap of concealment") which is simply a hat (or less commonly a veil) that gives <b>the</b> <b>alp</b> magic powers and the ability to turn invisible while worn (see also cloak of invisibility). The hat is visible no matter what shape <b>the</b> <b>alp</b> takes. An alp who has lost this hat will offer a great reward for its safe return. <b>The</b> <b>alp</b> also possesses an [...] "evil eye" [...] whose gaze will inflict illness and misfortune. Removing or damaging this eye also removes <b>the</b> <b>alp's</b> malicious intentions.|$|R

5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing <b>the</b> <b>Alps</b> because {{he felt that he}} both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's painting is relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon's clothes appear to have been researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.|$|E
