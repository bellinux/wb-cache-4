5|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High and the South Pacific High both {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} winds in Argentina. Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina. This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central {{parts of the country}} are affected by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean is {{generally}} inhospitable {{to the formation}} of a tropical storm.

5|$|Fishing {{regulations}} include catch {{limits and}} gear restrictions to prevent {{damage to the}} species habitat and population.

5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Atlantic</b> high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E
