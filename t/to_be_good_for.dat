On 8 December, the hatch between the two was opened and the two crews greeted each other for the first time. It had remained closed to maintain their respective atmospheric pressures. The Expedition 1 crew took this opportunity to leave the station and tour the inside of the space shuttle, which was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> their psychological well-being.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, Camberley grew in size.

25|$|Pitches in Australia have {{traditionally}} been known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> fast bowlers because {{of the amount of}} bounce that can be generated on these surfaces. In particular, the pitch at the WACA Ground in Perth is regarded as being possibly the quickest pitch in the world. The Gabba in Brisbane is also known to assist fast bowlers with its bounce. However, these kinds of bouncy pitches also open up more areas for run-scoring, as they promote the playing of a lot of pull, hook and cut shots. Batsmen who play these shots well have a lot of success on these pitches.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E

500|$|The HTC First was {{released}} to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera. Its design {{was considered to}} have a comfortable size and shape by contrast to larger flagship Android phones, and a display that was noted for its high resolution, good color reproduction and [...] "ridiculous" [...] viewing angles (but still being hard to use in direct sunlight). The First's camera {{was considered to be}} better than expected for a low-end phone, but produced [...] "muddy" [...] photos and [...] " [...] like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh-useless in the dark." [...] Facebook Home's functionality was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> casual users, but the ability to switch back to a stock Android 4.1 interface was considered [...] "stunning" [...] and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time.|$|E
500|$|When Howard Hughes {{purchased}} {{the hotel in}} the mid-1960s for $14.6 million, the architect Martin Stern, Jr. added a 500-room circular tower, which opened in 1967, and the hotel became a Las Vegas landmark. Hughes grew particularly annoyed every time the Rat Pack were in his hotel, due to a hatred of Frank Sinatra which stemmed {{from the fact that}} he had been in love with Ava Gardner in the 50s and she had run off to marry him. The ill feeling was reciprocated by Sinatra. Hughes plotted to oust Sinatra from the Sands for good, and asked Robert Maheu to draw up a plan shortly after the new hotel opened in 1967. The hotel imposed restrictions on what Sinatra could gamble in the casino, to just $3,000 a night. Under previous management, Sinatra had no limits on the amount of credit extended to him by the Sands casino. [...] His IOUs, chits or [...] "markers" [...] were torn up at the end of Sinatra's engagements because he was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> business-bringing the hotel more monetary value than the worth of his gambling losses. Hughes put a stop to this system, telling Jack Entratter to inform Sinatra of the new policy; Entratter did not do so because he was afraid.|$|E

500|$|While {{the team}} was en route to England, the players elected Trott as captain ahead of George Giffen. On {{the opening day of}} the first Test [...] at Lord's, England bowled Australia out in 75minutes for only 53runs on a pitch thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> batting. In reply, England made 292 with Trott taking two wickets. [...] In their second innings, Australia was still 177 runs in arrears with three wickets down when Syd Gregory joined Trott at the crease. Their {{partnership}} of 221runs led Wisden to record that, [...] "as long as cricket is played... cause the match to be remembered". Trott's score of 143 (the only Test century of his career) was not enough to prevent England winning by six wickets. [...] In the second Test at Manchester, Australia again batted first, scoring 412runs; Frank Iredale making 108 and Trott 53. [...] At the beginning of England's first innings, Trott opened the bowling with his flighted leg-spin. [...] It was unusual for a leg-spinner to take the new ball, but the move—a [...] "stroke of genius" [...] according to Wisden—was successful as he dismissed Stoddart and W. G. Grace for low scores. Both batsmen were deceived by Trott's flight and stumped by the wicket-keeper. [...] England totaled 231 and, forced to follow on, scored 305runs in the second innings, K. S. Ranjitsinhji making 154 not out. In a tense finish, Australia made the 125runs needed for victory with three wickets in hand. On a pitch affected by rain, England won the series and The Ashes, defeating Australia in the Third Test by 66runs; Australia were bowled out for 44runs in the second innings, at one stage having lost [...] nine wickets for 25.|$|E

To engage in dhikr is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and love, or [...] "to seek a state of godwariness". The Qur'an refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of dhikr of Allah (65:10–11).
