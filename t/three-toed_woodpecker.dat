5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards.

30|$|Because {{of their}} known {{association}} with severely burned forests, {{we expected that}} burn severity would influence <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> {{across a range of}} spatial scales. However, it was not clear how the spatial patterning of burn severity would affect their use of the burned landscape, in part because of our limited understanding of how burn-severity patterns affect beetle abundance. In addition, tree size can influence foraging decisions of woodpeckers (Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998). To quantify the response of <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> to burn severity and prey availability at multiple scales, we evaluated scales corresponding to home range size (reported as ranging from 30 ha to 300 ha; Leonard 2001), foraging patches within home ranges, and trees within patches. At each of these scales, we evaluated the relative importance of burn severity, beetle occurrence, and tree size in predicting the settlement patterns and foraging behavior of <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> We use the scaling of burn severity patterns at the Hayman Fire, and the woodpecker’s response to these patterns, to illustrate the importance of scale in evaluating burn severity in studies of fire effects. Because of the importance of burned forests to <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> we also discuss the implications of our results for fire management in forested systems characterized by a mixed-severity fire regime.|$|R

30|$|Hierarchical {{levels of}} analysis. We {{evaluated}} {{the response of}} <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> to burn severity, beetle occurrence, and tree size at three levels: home-range, foraging patches, and trees within foraging patches. At the largest scale, corresponding to home-range size, the dependent variable was {{the presence or absence}} of <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> in survey plots. To evaluate use vs. availability at the foraging-patch scale, we compared foraging patches to subplots. Within patches, we evaluated the characteristics of used vs. unused trees by comparing foraging and paired trees. Each hierarchical level was analyzed separately.|$|R
30|$|The {{response}} to burn severity was strongly scale-dependent. <b>Three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> generally established territories in moderately burned areas, which were heterogeneous and included {{the full spectrum}} of burn severities. At the foraging-patch level, it was necessary to evaluate burn severity at two scales (foraging patches, home range) in order to characterize use of severely burned foraging patches; within home ranges, woodpeckers disproportionately foraged in patches of trees that had complete crown scorch or canopy consumption compared to that available. However, they rarely used severely burned patches within larger severely burned areas (Figure 4). Within foraging patches, burn severity was not useful in predicting foraging patterns because burn severity was relatively homogeneous at this scale. These scale-dependent patterns indicate that the spatial heterogeneity of post-fire forests may affect use by <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> The woodpeckers rarely established territories in severely burned areas that did not contain live trees (Figure 3 a), but readily foraged in severely burned patches within home ranges of intermediate burn severities (Figure 4). Consequently, the scaling of burn-severity patterns may affect how <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> respond to burn severity.|$|R
30|$|Differences in prey {{availability}} {{may also}} contribute to variation among studies. In particular, the effects of burn severity on beetle occurrence can vary among tree species, which {{may be related to}} the effect of bark thickness on water loss during burning (Saint-Germain et al. 2004). In a burn in Quebec, Canada, severely burned black spruce (Picea mariana), which has relatively thin bark, had low densities of bark and wood-boring beetles (Saint-Germaine et al. 2004). In contrast, severely burned ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, which have relatively thick bark, had high densities of wood-boring beetles at the Hayman Fire. Previous studies in unburned (Imbeau and Desrochers 2002) and burned (Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998) forests concluded that <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> disproportionately consumed bark beetle larvae. However, our results suggest that <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> may opportunistically consume the most numerically dominant prey species, which in our system was the much larger wood-boring beetle larvae. Thus, information on prey availability, in addition to burn severity, is necessary to compare woodpecker studies. The presence of congeners may also affect prey use by <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998).|$|R
60|$|The Dutch naturalist Zollinger, who resided a {{long time}} {{on the island of}} Bali, informs us that its {{productions}} completely assimilate with those of Java, and that he is not aware of a single animal found in it which does not inhabit the larger island. During the few days which I stayed on the north coast of Bali on my way to Lombock, I saw several birds highly characteristic of Javan ornithology. Among these were the yellow-headed weaver (Ploceus hypoxantha), the black grasshopper thrush (Copsychus amoenus), the rosy barbet (Megalaema rosea), the Malay oriole (Oriolus horsfieldi), the Java ground starling (Sturnopastor jalla), and the Javanese <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Chrysonotus tiga). On crossing over to Lombock, separated from Bali by a strait less than twenty miles wide, I naturally expected to meet with some of these birds again; but during a stay there of three months I never saw one of them, but found a totally different set of species, most of which were utterly unknown not only in Java, but also in Borneo, Sumatra, and Malacca. For example, among the commonest birds in Lombock were white cockatoos and three species of Meliphagidae or honeysuckers, belonging to family groups which are entirely absent from the western or Indo-Malayan region of the Archipelago. On passing to Flores and Timor the distinctness from the Javanese productions increases, and we find that these islands form a natural group, whose birds are related to those of Java and Australia, but are quite distinct from either. Besides my own collections in Lombock and Timor, my assistant Mr. Allen made a good collection in Flores; and these, with a few species obtained by the Dutch naturalists, enable us to form a very good idea of the natural history of this group of islands, and to derive therefrom some very interesting results.|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, if {{woodpeckers}} were responding {{solely to}} beetle occurrence {{at the home}} range scale, we would expect peak woodpecker occurrence in high-severity areas where beetle occurrence was highest, in contrast to what we observed at the Hayman Fire. Accordingly, patterns of beetle occurrence at home-range scales were not sufficient to predict the settlement patterns of <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> within the burn, suggesting other features of moderately burned areas (e.g., presence of live trees or congeneric species) {{played an important role}} at this scale. Within foraging patches, however, beetle occurrence was more important than burn severity in predicting tree use. Such variation among scales indicates that both beetle occurrence and burn severity may influence <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Linkages between scales may also affect how <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> respond to post-fire conditions (Figure 4). Decisions about where to establish a territory may be influenced by prey availability. The establishment of territories subsequently constrains prey availability for nesting woodpeckers. Consequently, analyses at a particular scale reflect factors that may be necessary, but not sufficient, to understand woodpecker decisions at that scale.|$|R
40|$|This project took {{advantage}} of pre-fire data gathered within the perimeter of Colorado’s 2002 Hayman Fire. Researchers studied the unique fire regime of Front Range ponderosa pine forests, and fire effects on understory-plant communities and American <b>Three-toed</b> <b>Woodpeckers.</b> Results confi rmed that historically, the diverse structure of these forests was maintained by a mixed-severity fi re regime that included large areas of severe fire. In addition, researchers found {{that much of the}} burn meets habitat requirements for American <b>Three-toed</b> <b>Woodpeckers,</b> and that understory plant species that were present before the fire returned afterward, with only a slight {{increase in the number of}} exotic species...|$|R
30|$|Our {{results at}} the Hayman Fire {{demonstrate}} that response patterns can vary among studies {{simply as a}} result of differences in sampling scale and the scaling of burn severity patterns. Even within the same forest type and fire regime, the spatial patterning of burn severity can vary. Consider, for example, several recent fires that occurred on the Pike National Forest near the Hayman Fire. In 2000, the 4422 ha Hi Meadow Fire had relatively small crown fire patches (< 500 ha) compared to the Hayman Fire. In 1996, the 3059 ha Buffalo Creek Fire was dominated by a wind-driven crown fire, but because of its elongated shape, the center of the crown fire area generally did not exceed 500 m from live trees. In contrast, the size of the crown fire areas at the Hayman Fire greatly exceeded the total size of these smaller burns, and portions of the crown fire areas were as much as 1000 m from live trees. Our results indicate that the spatial scaling of high-severity burns at the Hi Meadow Fire and Buffalo Creek Fire created potentially suitable habitat for <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Likewise, heterogeneity in burn severity across much of the Hayman Fire provides suitable habitat for <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> but the center of the high-severity areas at the Hayman Fire may be too far from live trees to be readily used by <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> Remnant patches of live trees within high-severity patches may increase the likelihood that <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> would use such areas.|$|R

30|$|Habitat {{selection}} and foraging behavior by <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> within post-fire landscapes may be {{inextricably linked to}} the spatial patterns of burn severity. Because burn severity influences resource distribution (e.g., nest sites, food availability) at multiple scales, {{it is critical to}} link information between different scales (Wiens 1989, Kotliar and Wiens 1990, Levin 1992). Decisions at a particular scale (e.g., where to forage) may be constrained by decisions related to patterns of burn severity at finer (e.g., selection of individual trees within patches) and larger spatial scales (decisions about where to establish a territory). In addition, beetle availability can vary dramatically over very short time frames (e.g., < 5 yr post-fire; Hutto 1995, Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998, Covert-Bratland et al. 2006). Consequently, tracking prey availability within a post-fire landscape requires <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> to integrate information across spatial and temporal scales.|$|R

30|$|At the Hayman Fire, wind-driven {{crown fire}} that burned ∼ 25 000 ha {{in a single}} day created an {{extensive}} area of dead trees (Graham 2003). Yet, the fire created considerable heterogeneity by leaving remnant patches of live trees within and along the edges of this large severely burned area, where we often found <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Figure 1). They also occurred in areas with finer-scale heterogeneity in burn severity created by more moderate fire behavior (Figure 1). The strong association of <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> with burned forests containing large areas of moderately and severely burned trees demonstrates the importance of the mixed-severity fire regime to this species. It is becoming increasingly clear that severe fires played a greater role in historic fire regimes in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests of the Colorado Front Range than generally acknowledged (Sheriff and Veblen 2006, 2007). Because the fire regime of most of the area burned by the Hayman Fire is either mixed- or high-severity, fire suppression (and its effect on fuels) may have played a lesser role in the severity of this fire than climate variation and past legacies of severe fires (Sheriff and Veblen 2006, 2007). Yet, fire management programs typically emphasize the use of understory fires and forest thinning to prevent severe fires. This could negatively affect <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> by destroying existing snags while potentially reducing the opportunities for creating large areas of snags that provide critical foraging and nesting sites (Horton and Mannan 1988, Hutto and Gallo 2006). Post-fire salvage logging, which often targets larger trees, further compounds this problem by reducing the suitability of post-fire forests for this species (Hutto 1995, Kotliar et al. 2002), in part by reducing prey availability (Hutto 2006, Hutto and Gallo 2006). Thus, inclusion of high-intensity fires in management prescriptions and judicious use of salvage logging is essential for fire-dependent species like <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> (Hutto 1995, Kotliar et al. 2002, Hutto 2006, Hutto and Gallo 2006).|$|R
30|$|Time since fire {{can greatly}} affect prey availability. Beetle {{abundance}} typically peaks {{within the first}} year or two post-fire because beetles most readily attack dying or recently dead trees (Ryan and Amman 1996). In areas of complete crown consumption, most trees die within the first year post-fire. Mortality can be more protracted in moderate-severity areas because some partially burned trees may take several years to succumb to the stress of fire and beetle attack. As a result, beetle abundance may remain elevated longer in moderately burned areas than in high-severity areas (McHugh and Kolb 2003). Because <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> have high nest site fidelity (Cramp 1985), selection for areas with mixed-severity burns may result in greater average prey availability than in more severely burned areas over longer time frames than evaluated here. Consequently, both spatial and temporal variation in resources may affect burn use by <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b>|$|R
30|$|To locate {{foraging}} <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> {{we conducted}} area searches in 19 additional accessible areas distributed {{across the entire}} burn. All search areas contained {{the full range of}} burn severities and ranged from ∼ 50 ha to 2000 ha, for a total of ∼ 10 000 ha searched. Within these areas, two observers simultaneously walked along transects of variable length, spaced 100 m apart. Once an observer located a foraging woodpecker, we waited 10 s (Hejl and Verner 1990, Block 1991) before recording up to 10 foraging trees per bird or until the bird was out of view. To minimize the probability of including more than one foraging bout per individual, we only included birds that were at least 500 m from previously encountered <b>three-toed</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> of the same sex (i.e., ≥ 20 ha sighting area around each bird; Block 1991). We also included birds that were within 500 m of another individual but associated with different nest cavities.|$|R
