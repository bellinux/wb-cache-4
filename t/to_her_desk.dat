5|$|Michael takes Holly on a {{walk through}} the office, {{pointing}} out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. He {{opens the door to}} the kitchen, revealing all of the other employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, during Sebelius's {{second term}} in office, {{there was a}} report in the Wichita Eagle that the State of Kansas was {{suspending}} tax refunds and that, {{because of a lack of}} tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E
60|$|She crossed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> uncle's <b>desk</b> {{and looked}} downward. The carpet had {{apparently}} not been disturbed. There {{were no signs}} {{that it had been}} touched at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, my friend," [...] said she, {{putting out}} <b>her</b> left hand <b>to</b> him across <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> [...] "I {{did not expect}} you to-day and was this very instant writing to you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it {{is really}} odd {{that you should have}} hit so exactly on Maggie's {{appearance}} and manners," [...] said the cunning Lucy, moving <b>to</b> reach <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> [...] "because she might have been like her brother, you know; and Tom has not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at people." ...|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} two books {{published}} featuring scripts from As Seen On TV. Up To You, Porky (published in 1985) features scripts from the first series mixed in with extracts from Wood and Walters and Wood's stage show Lucky Bag. In 1987, the follow-up Barmy was published, featuring sketches entirely collated from As Seen On TV. Barmy features a Margery and Joan sketch specially written as {{an introduction to the}} book, where they review forthcoming novels. Also exclusive to this book are two sketches cut from the original broadcast, 'Lady Police Serial', a parody of the long-running Juliet Bravo, where Wood as Juliet chats <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>Desk</b> Sergeant Wilberforce. Also, 'Craft Shop', where the owner (Rosalind March) tries to tempt her customer (Celia Imrie) with the likes of [...] "Ukrainian Prayer Shawls, woven by the mothers of Russian dissidents whilst in a state of euphoria, which doesn't happen very often which is why we've only got three." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Lee {{in a warehouse}} and begins with her burying a photograph beneath {{a hole in the}} floorboards. After she walks away singing [...] "Under your spell again, I can't say no to you" [...] while looking directly in the camera, the hole in the floorboard slowly covers up. As she walks by a bookcase, she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking. Then she goes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to write in a diary, while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt. After finishing with the writing, she walks by a mirror and takes a look at herself as it starts to melt. As she begins to play a baby grand piano, the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames. The room appears to be burnt and wasted. As the sun begins to shine through the windows of the building, a small vine grows from the floorboard and expands across the room, and blue flowers begin to blossom from the vines above the piano.|$|E
2500|$|Luckett {{was born}} on March 11, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She grew up singing in her local Brentwood Baptist Church. She also took vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, {{who was also a}} singer, was very proud of his daughter's vocal talents and tried to get her in the music business. Luckett is the older of two children. Luckett was given the chance to sing her first solo at the age of five. [...] "The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang," [...] she recalled. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's choir and began {{performing}} in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> in class to find a girl sitting in her seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl (who turned out to be Beyoncé Knowles) from her assigned seat. They later became friends and she was invited to join Beyoncé's singing group Girls Tyme, which later became Destiny's Child.|$|E
60|$|She {{took him}} over <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>desk,</b> opened such of the drawers as were not locked, and searched amongst their {{contents}} ruthlessly. By {{the time they}} had finished the last drawer, Lessingham had quite a little collection of charts, more or less finished, in his hand.|$|R
50|$|The next day, {{after all}} that drama, Chuck goes all deep and wise and proves that Serena and Nate have both learnt things from their escapades. Oh, and he says he's totally fine about the Blair wedding {{invitation}} and Nate doesn't need to protect him. After a couple of hugs, Nate goes {{to pick up his}} phone from Diana's house, while Serena goes <b>to</b> clear <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Aimee Garcia as Sergeant Didi Diaz, Carter's former partner. After her son Derrick was born, {{she decided}} <b>to</b> work from <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> {{instead of on}} the streets. <b>To</b> avoid <b>her</b> from being humiliated from the other cops, Carter took the heat and let them believe that he dumped her as a partner.|$|R
2500|$|Dayna Klein, a Federation {{employee}} who was five months pregnant, heard the shots being fired {{and as she}} went to the door of her office, Haq fired at her abdomen, but the bullet hit her raised arm. According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Fenwick {{immediately}} went <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and {{wrote to her}} friend.|$|E
60|$|He went off, and Wilhelmina after a {{few minutes}} went <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and wrote a letter to Stephen Hurd.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{paper over}} here," [...] said the grim Miss Joan, in a {{somewhat}} singular voice. She had passed over <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sister's <b>desk</b> by the doorway, and was holding a sheet of blue foolscap in her hand. There was a sour {{smile on her face}} that seemed unfit for such a scene or occasion, and Flambeau looked at her with a darkening brow.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{she went}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> little <b>desk</b> in the corner, {{unlocked}} it with trembling hands, snatched her cheque-book {{out of a}} heap of still unsettled bills, and having locked that anti-climax safe away again, turned upon him. [...] "Here it is," [...] she said, and stood poised for a moment. Then she flung down the little narrow grey cover--nearly empty, it was, of cheques, on the floor before him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Joan Stacey, dark, with a drawn {{face and}} hair prematurely touched with grey, walked {{straight}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>desk</b> {{and set out}} her papers with a practical flap. The mere action rallied everyone else to sanity. If Miss Joan Stacey was a criminal, she was a cool one. Father Brown regarded her for some time with an odd little smile, and then, without {{taking his eyes off}} <b>her,</b> addressed himself <b>to</b> somebody else.|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and {{returned}} with a folded envelope. He stuffed it into his waistcoat pocket.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not stay}} {{to see the}} melons cut, but went back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and he brought a choice slice in to her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose they}} are gone by this time,' said Anne, as Lady Merton left the room, and she sat down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to write to her brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't they be?" [...] said Jeff. [...] "They've got {{the other}} sex either {{grafting}} or working overtime for 'em. They're {{all right in}} business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much. Then {{you want to have}} a flat footed, heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers, five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy <b>to</b> take <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> Now there was that widow lady that me and Andy Tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in Cairo.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} years of her life, she faced lung cancer in her typical {{challenging}} brave hard-working mood. For some months, in her four-year fight, she flew daily to Switzerland for treatment in the morning <b>to</b> be at <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> in Madrid at 4 p.m. for the millions who had made it into a habit to tune into COPE to listen to the four-hour show.|$|R
5000|$|As his {{education}} developed, his teachers “were a little perplexed {{what to do}} with me.” He described how he wasn’t learning anything he hadn’t already learned and was bullied by one of his teachers who expected him <b>to</b> “sit under <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and be ridiculed” for no apparent reason. The bullying increased after he “got extremely angry and jumped on top of the desk to denounce her.” ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNYS [She crosses <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> by the window. Not {{the same}} instant but the next his [...] "Goodbye" [...] strikes her. She turns.] You're not going out, are you? ...|$|E
60|$|She went at once <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> {{and wrote}} a letter to Mary Compton, an old schoolmate who had gone to Chicago and whose {{guidance}} to bed and board now seemed valuable.|$|E
60|$|When school {{went out}} Anne marched <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> ostentatiously took out {{everything}} therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.|$|E
500|$|In September 1892, Coolbrith {{was given}} three days' notice <b>to</b> clear <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>to</b> be {{replaced}} as librarian by her nephew Henry Frank Peterson. A library trustee {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "we need a librarian not a poet." [...] Coolbrith's literary friends were outraged, and published a lengthy opinion piece to that effect in the San Francisco Examiner. Peterson's plans for the library were quite successful, however; under his guidance circulation quickly grew from 3,000 to 13,000. Peterson opened the library on Sundays and holidays and increased accessibility to the stacks—he was praised by trustees for his [...] "management improvements".|$|R
5000|$|Later, Juliana {{offers to}} sell a {{portrait}} miniature of Aspern to the narrator for an exorbitant price. She doesn't mention Jeffrey Aspern's name, but the narrator still believes she possesses some of his letters. When the old woman falls ill, the narrator ventures into her room and gets caught by Juliana as he is about <b>to</b> rifle <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> for the letters. Juliana calls the narrator a [...] "publishing scoundrel" [...] and collapses. The narrator flees, and when he returns some days later, he discovers that Juliana has died. Miss Tita hints that he can have the Aspern letters if he marries her.|$|R
50|$|The story unwinds {{into the}} double climax of Juliana's {{discovery}} of the narrator about <b>to</b> break into <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and Miss Tita's revelation that she has destroyed the papers. Miss Tita is ashamed of <b>her</b> marriage proposal <b>to</b> the narrator, but James implies that she does exactly {{the right thing by}} depriving him of the papers. In a way, she develops into the true heroine of the story.|$|R
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} and moved across <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> He sat quite still, {{watching}} her without any apparent curiosity. She unlocked a drawer and returned to him with a bankbook in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|ANNYS [She {{has crossed}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> She is humming. She seats herself, takes paper and pen, writes. Without turning--still writing--she raises her voice.] Geoffrey! How do you spell [...] "experimental"? One [...] "r" [...] or two? ...|$|E
60|$|He was immensely puzzled. She had not resented {{his strange}} intrusion. She had {{accepted}} it, indeed, with curious equanimity. Her forefinger lingered still over the little ivory knob {{of the bell}} attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk.</b> He shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
5000|$|Claire {{decides to}} sell Robert's house {{back to the}} {{university}} and wants Catherine <b>to</b> come with <b>her</b> <b>to</b> New York; Catherine is upset {{that she will be}} forced to leave the house. It becomes evident that Claire suspects that Catherine may be struggling with mental illnesses, as their father had. A wake held at the house the night after the funeral, is attended by many academic mathematicians. Hal appears and chats up Catherine. Softening up to Hal, Catherine sleeps with him. Afterwards, she gives the student a key <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>desk.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{paused a}} moment in doubt, then put his hat {{on his head and}} {{prepared}} <b>to</b> leave <b>her.</b> She had behaved very well, but still he would not be weak enough <b>to</b> yield <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in everything at once. As <b>to</b> opening <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> or going up-stairs into her room, that he felt to be quite impossible. Even his nature did not admit of that. But neither did his nature allow him <b>to</b> ask <b>her</b> pardon and <b>to</b> own that he had been wrong. She had said that he must implore her forgiveness at her feet. One word, however, one look, would have sufficed. But that word and that look were, at the present moment, out of his power. [...] "Good-bye, Nina," [...] he said. [...] "It is best that I should leave you now." ...|$|R
60|$|That brought <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{mind the}} white slate on which {{her father had}} been writing, and she hurried to secure it, though she hardly knew where to go or to look; but straying into her father's dressing-room, she found both it and the tablets among a heap of other small matters that had been, cleared away when the other chamber had been {{arranged}} into the solemnity of the death-room. Hastily securing them, she carried them <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>desk</b> in the deserted school-room, feeling as if they were her charge, and thus having no scruple in reading them.|$|R
