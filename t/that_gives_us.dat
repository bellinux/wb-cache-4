Flickering Myth called the short [...] "a great effort. A nice, compact story <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> {{a lot of great}} moments with the character." [...] The reviewer felt Flynn made a [...] "great foil" [...] to Carter, and also noted the [...] "great cameos and a post credit scene that should put a smile on everybody’s face....Agent Carter is another great Marvel offering that shows how committed they are to the idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine." ...|$|E

Keith DeCandido, {{in a review}} for Tor.com, commended Stiers' acting, saying that he gave [...] "a noble, nuanced performance as Timicin." [...] He also approved of the episode, {{saying that it was}} the first time that Lwaxana Troi was treated as a real character without causing him to cringe; at the same time, DeCandido did not forget the problems with her previous appearances on the show. Noting [...] that it was one of the best episodes to feature a Prime Directive debate, DeCandido endorsed the writer's idea not to take sides regarding the suicide. [...] "This is a magnificent, tragic love story, one that takes a thin character and gives her depth, one <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> a beautifully realized guest character in Timicin (casting Stiers was a masterstroke, as he always brings subtle nuance to his roles), and one that takes its issues seriously," [...] DeCandido wrote. He gave the episode a score of eight out of ten, later concluding that it featured [...] "one of the show's most tragic love stories." ...|$|E

500|$|Hubbard {{took three}} major new {{initiatives}} {{in the face}} of these challenges. [...] "Ethics Technology" [...] was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to [...] "disconnect" [...] from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or [...] "suppressive". According to church-operated websites, “A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." [...] Hubbard stated: “Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> our right to privacy.” Scientologists were also required to write [...] "Knowledge Reports" [...] on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable [...] "Misdemeanors", [...] "Crimes", and [...] "High Crimes". The [...] "Fair Game" [...] policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an [...] "enemy" [...] of Scientology: [...] "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." ...|$|E

But at the end, we come away with a film <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> something {{to hold on to}} permanently even as the characters on screen lose practically everything worth holding on to". Jha also wrote that the sequences between Chopra and Ranaut as the highlights of the film. Gaurav Malani from The Economic Times rated the film a 3 out of 5, praised Chopra's performance and wrote, [...] "Chopra's character graph [...] skillfully sketched from an aspiring model to an ambitious showstopper to a brash supermodel and subsequently to a faded manikin, desperate to make her comeback. In each phase her character exudes [...] contrasting gamut of emotions". Khalid Mohamed rated Fashion 3 out of 5, called the film a [...] "must-try", and wrote, [...] "Excelling on the catwalk {{as well as in the}} moments of self-destruction, Ranaut’s is the terrific, show-stopping performance". Sonia Chopra of Sify criticised the film's superficial portrayal of the fashion industry and called the film a superficial take on the lives of models and a dumbed-down version of the workings of the fashion industry. However, she praised the performances.|$|E

2500|$|The gospels {{describe}} Joseph as a [...] "tekton" [...] (τέκτων).

The Greek term evokes an artisan with wood in general, or an artisan in iron or stone. But the specific association with woodworking is a constant in Early Christian tradition; Justin Martyr (died c. 165) wrote that Jesus made yokes and ploughs, and there are similar early references.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{the same}} lines, Hanson {{has argued that}} history proves that multi-cultural {{societies}} have too often proved disastrous failures, and that only way of preventing a society from collapsing into tribal bloodbaths is a [...] "common culture, one that artificially suppresses the natural instinct of humans to identify first with their particular tribe". As {{an example of what}} he sees as a law of history, Hanson wrote: [...] "The Italian Roman Republic lasted about 500 years. In contrast, the multiracial Roman Empire that after the Edict of Caracalla in AD 212 made all its diverse peoples equal citizens endured little more than two (often violent) centuries." [...] Along the same lines Hanson wrote in the 2016 column [...] "Diversity: History's Pathway to Chaos" [...] that: [...] "Emphasizing diversity has been the pitfall, not the strength, of nations throughout history". Hanson charged that the current celebration of diversity was destroying America and ended with the statement if the celebration of diversity did not end: [...] "Otherwise, we will end up as 50 separate and rival nations—just like other failed states in history whose diverse tribes and races destroyed themselves in a Hobbesian dog-eat-dog war with one another." [...] In a 2013 column titled [...] "Western Cultural Suicide", Hanson wrote: [...] "Multiculturalism—as opposed to the notion of a multiracial society united by a single culture—has become an abject contradiction in the modern Western world... Western hosts lost confidence in the very society <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> the wealth and leisure to ignore or caricature its foundations. The result is that millions of immigrants flock to the West, enjoy its material security, and yet feel little need to bond with their adopted culture, given that their hosts themselves are ambiguous about what others desperately seek out." ...|$|E
