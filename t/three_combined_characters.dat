40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the combination of}} Type-III classifiers using the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. Various methods of building BPA's for each classifier using both "global" and "local" classifier information are explored. We propose modifications to two established BPAcomputation methods to make them better suited for combining Type-III classifiers. We also show the effectiveness of using compound hypotheses when a classifier cannot confidently choose between the top two returned classes. Experimental tests demonstrate the superiority {{of some of the}} approaches proposed here on the numeral recognition problem when <b>combining</b> <b>three</b> different <b>character</b> recognizers with Type-III classification engines...|$|R
50|$|The {{canonical}} ordering {{is mainly}} {{concerned with the}} ordering of a sequence of <b>combining</b> <b>characters.</b> For the examples in this section we assume these characters to be diacritics, even though in general some diacritics are not <b>combining</b> <b>characters,</b> and some <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> are not diacritics.|$|R
5000|$|OpenType has the ccmp [...] "feature tag" [...] {{to define}} glyphs that are {{compositions}} or decompositions involving <b>combining</b> <b>characters,</b> also has mark tag {{to define the}} positioning of <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> onto base glyph, and mkmk for the positionings of <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> onto each other.|$|R
5000|$|Normalization. Unicode has <b>combining</b> <b>characters.</b> Like old typewriters, plain letters can be {{followed}} {{by one or more}} non-spacing symbols (usually diacritics like accent marks) to form a single printing character, but also provides precomposed characters, i.e. characters that already include one or more <b>combining</b> <b>characters.</b> A sequence of a <b>character</b> + <b>combining</b> <b>character</b> should be matched with the identical single precomposed character. The process of standardizing sequences of <b>characters</b> + <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> is called normalization.|$|R
5000|$|In digital typography, <b>combining</b> <b>{{characters}}</b> are {{characters that}} {{are intended to}} modify other characters. The most common <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> in the Latin script are the combining diacritical marks (including combining accents).|$|R
2500|$|Unicode {{allows the}} user to choose between precomposed <b>characters</b> and <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> in {{inputting}} Vietnamese. [...] Because, in the past, some fonts implemented <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> in a nonstandard way (see Verdana font), most people use precomposed characters when composing Vietnamese-language documents.|$|R
50|$|The <b>combining</b> <b>{{characters}}</b> {{and base}} characters {{are in a}} different order than used in Unicode. The following are some examples. The <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> are not always stored in reverse order as Unicode normalization. The MARC-21 standard describes the MARC-8 Unicode conversion issues in more detail.|$|R

5000|$|Combining Diacritical Marks is a Unicode block {{containing}} {{the most common}} <b>combining</b> <b>characters.</b> It also contains the character [...] "Combining Grapheme Joiner", which prevents canonical reordering of <b>combining</b> <b>characters,</b> and despite the name, actually separates characters {{that would otherwise be}} considered a single grapheme in a given context.|$|R

Although non-spacing graphic characters are uncommon in traditional code pages, {{there are many}} such in Unicode. A <b>combining</b> <b>character</b> has its distinct glyph, but it applies to a character box of another character, a spacing one. In some historical systems such as line printers this was implemented as overstrike.|$|R

25|$|Both the dakuten and handakuten glyphs {{are drawn}} identically in hiragana and {{katakana}} scripts. The <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> are rarely used in full-width Japanese characters, as Unicode and all common multibyte Japanese encodings provide precomposed glyphs for all possible dakuten and handakuten character combinations {{in the standard}} hiragana and katakana ranges. However, <b>combining</b> <b>characters</b> are required in half-width kana, which does not provide any precomposed characters in order to fit within a single byte.|$|R
