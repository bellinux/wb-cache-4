5|$|The three {{actors were}} given martial arts {{training}} ahead of filming. From August 1980, they were tutored by Kiyoshi Yamazaki, a karate black belt and master swordsman, who drilled them in sword-fighting styles that were meant <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> proficient in using their weapons. They practiced each {{move in a}} fight at least 15times before filming. Yamazaki advised Leonard on the choreography of the sword fights and had a cameo role as one of Conan's instructors.|$|E

They are based on the steam locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E

Adaptive interface, with all the numerous achievements throughout 30 years of its history, contains and in reality is based on one fundamental flaw - on the assumption that designer knows better than anyone else what is good for users in each and all cases. Programs of the new type - user-driven applications - still deliver to users the best results of developers' work but at the same time give users the full control over applications and in this way really allow each user to change an application {{in such a way as}} he wants it to look at each particular moment. Users can move and resize each and all of the screen objects while an application is running, and this changes the whole programming philosophy. Comment: 14 pages, 3 tables, 5 figure...|$|R

There is little chance that the vagueness of a word like 'uncertainty', given the nuances of its ordinary, poetic, and technical uses, can be herded by a particular writing utensil, but there do exist established models and formal theories that address definable aspects of uncertainty, and these have enough uses <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> worth <b>looking</b> into.|$|R
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E

25|$|Pernkopf {{instructed}} them {{to paint}} the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism {{was the use of}} color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the staff}} found it {{challenging}} {{to run the}} game at 60 frames per second in high definition. The demand for 60 frames per second over more detailed graphics was made to ensure the game performed well online. Nevertheless, to save production time and budget, Oda allowed for three characters to obscure their faces so they would not require facial animations. Sound director Hideki Asanaka also found problems incorporating all the sound effects for the 3D game in contrast to previous titles. The team used camerawork in every Max Super Desperation Move and Climax Super Special Move in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> stylish.

25|$|The {{campaign}} was overshadowed by U.S. media criticism of Kỳ and Thiệu's unfair electoral practices and sneaky tricks. All the candidates {{were scheduled to}} attend a rally at Quảng Trị in the far north of the country on 6 August. Owing to the security situation {{and the possibility of}} communist attacks, the politicians were transported to joint campaign events by the military, rather than being free to go to separate events as their strategy dictated. However, the Quảng Trị event had to be canceled after the candidates’ plane landed 23km away at an air base in Đông Hà. Believing that the mishap was a deliberate attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> chaotic and disorganized—Thiệu and Kỳ had decided not to attend rallies—the candidates boycotted the event and flew back to Saigon. There they denounced the government bitterly. The leading opposition candidate, Trần Văn Hương, claimed that Thiệu and Kỳ “purposefully arranged the trip to humiliate us and make clowns out of us.” As air force chief, Kỳ had previously stranded opposition politicians on a trip to the Central Highlands. Kỳ and Thiệu maintained that no malice was involved, but their opponents did not believe it. None of the candidates made good on their threat to withdraw, but their strident attacks over the alleged dirty tricks dominated the media coverage of the election for a period.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door. The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like they would in summer.|$|E

60|$|At {{one time}} Rollo saw before him three {{children}} {{standing in a}} row {{by the side of}} the road. They seemed to have something in their hands. When he reached the place, he found that they had for sale some very cunning little Swiss cottages carved in wood. These carvings were extremely small and very pretty. Each one was put in a small box for safe transportation. In some cases the children had nothing to sell, and they simply held out their hands to beg as the travellers went by; and there were several lame persons, and idiots, and blind persons, and other objects of misery that occasionally appeared imploring charity. As, however, these unfortunates were generally satisfied with an exceedingly small donation, it did not cost much <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> all <b>look</b> very happy. There is a Swiss coin, of the value of a fifth part of a cent, which was generally enough to give; so that, for a New York shilling, Rollo found he could make more than sixty donations--which was certainly very cheap charity.|$|R
5000|$|A skilled {{photographer}} {{can manipulate}} how a viewer {{is likely to}} react to the content of a photo by manipulating the lighting. Outdoors that can require changing location, waiting for the ideal time of day or in some cases the ideal time of year for the lighting to create the desired impression in the photo or manipulating the natural lighting by using reflectors or flash. In a studio setting there is no limit to options for lighting objects <b>to</b> ether <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> [...] "seen by eye" [...] normal or surreal as the goals for the photograph require. But more often than not the reaction {{on the part of the}} view will be from the baseline of whether the lighting seems normal/natural or not compared to other clues. Mistakes less skilled photographer often make when mixing flash and natural lighting is not matching with the flash the highlight and shadow clues seen in the ambient lit background. If the background is illuminated by the setting sun but the face in the foreground appears to have been photographed at noon it will not seem normal because the clues don't match.|$|R

500|$|Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful {{it was to}} have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it {{provided}} references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, [...] "When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections – trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these two irises not aimed at the same place – trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> strange and <b>look</b> more human." [...] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.|$|R

Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called [...] "ControlNet" [...] to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as [...] "Omega" [...] to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic.The expansion also supports [...] "futurization", in which futuristic buildings tend to [...] "futurize" [...] the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings <b>to</b> simply <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on.

[...] Some of the scenes set in the cave sets were dropped as they would have taken too long to set up. Kor, Worf and Dax were in almost every scene of the episode and so time could not be saved by filming more than one scene at a time. The cave {{sequences}} were filmed on the cave standing sets on stage 18 of Paramount Studios. The sets were limited, so Burton said that {{in order to make it}} look like the characters were moving through a complex labyrinth of caves, he and director of photography Jonathan West used the sets' depth <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like different parts of the caves.|$|E

The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] bundled up for winter." [...] He strove <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like people you might see on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E

The Ba'ku village was built in full scale on location at Lake Sherwood, California, with architectural designs combining Thai, Balinese and Polynesian styles. The village included a bakery, a farm with a full irrigation system, a city hall, and a city square which was referred to as the [...] "rotunda". The location shoot lasted for six weeks. The buildings included sections built with styrofoam, which were cut out using computer aided design and computer-aided manufacturing techniques. These were covered in hardcoat <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> as though they were made from stone, but they were not made waterproof. The set suffered water damage following record-levels of rainfall during the spring of 1998. The foam warped as it dried out in the sun, causing delays in shooting while repairs were made.|$|E

5000|$|Griptape is the {{friction}} tape {{adhered to the}} topside of the deck to enable users to more easily maintain control of the deck. There are many types of griptape. Some use standard skateboard griptape although the griptape may wear out faster on fingerboards as they endure more moisture from sweat and oils from user's hands. There are also softer alternatives and grippy tape which is less harsh on a user's fingers allowing them to fingerboard {{for longer periods of}} time. Examples of this tape are Riptape, FBS Extra Smooth, No Comply Foamy Greatness, and Yellowood's Slim Tape. Trucks are the structures attached {{to the bottom of the}} deck that house the wheels and bushings. Some trucks are all one molded piece while others are scaled-down versions of regular skateboard trucks. Example: BRR Trucks, Y-Trucks. As fingerboarding has evolved [...] "collector" [...] and [...] "pro" [...] versions have emerged with some brands shaped using special instruments <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> lighter and <b>look</b> better. Bushings are pliable material that provide the cushion mechanism for turning a standard skateboard but on a fingerboard help stabilize the trucks thus keeping the wheels in the same position to enable stronger tricks and visual appeal. Collector and [...] "pro" [...] brand bushings are made from many different types of squishy material, usually rubberized plastic or rubber. The wheels can determine how smooth the ride is thus what kind of [...] "flow" [...] a user's ride can be.

Davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks, however, which his friend Ben called the [...] "gang-way," [...] through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there.
