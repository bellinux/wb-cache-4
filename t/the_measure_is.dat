25|$|The {{receivers}} are polarization-sensitive differential radiometers {{measuring the}} difference between two telescope beams. The signal is amplified with HEMT low-noise amplifiers, built by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. There are 20 feeds, 10 in each direction, from which a radiometer collects a signal; <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> {{the difference in the}} sky signal from opposite directions. The directional separation azimuth is 180 degrees; the total angle is 141 degrees. To avoid collecting Milky Way galaxy foreground signals, the WMAP uses five discrete radio frequency bands, from 23GHz to 94GHz.|$|E
40|$|<b>Measures</b> of {{association}} <b>are</b> suggested between two random vectors. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>are</b> copula-based and therefore invariant {{with respect to}} the univariate marginal distributions. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>are</b> able to capture positive as well as negative association. In case the random vectors are just random variables, <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> reduce to Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rho. Nonparametric estimators, based on ranks, for <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> <b>are</b> derived. Their large-sample asymptotics are derived and their small-sample behavior is investigated by simulation. <b>The</b> <b>measures</b> <b>are</b> applied to characterize strength and direction {{of association}} of northern and southern European bond markets during the recent Euro crisis as well as association of stock markets with bond markets...|$|R

Shorter follow-up versions of the VADRS are also available for parents and teachers and consists of 26 questions with an additional 12 side effect measures. Comparing scores from the {{different versions of the}} VADRS with other psychological measures have suggested the scores have good but limited reliability and validity across multiple samples. The VADRS has only been recently developed, however, so clinical application of <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> limited.|$|E

This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation.|$|E
25|$|A {{precision}} scale is a near necessity for reloading. While {{it is possible}} to load using nothing but a powder measure and a weight to volume conversion chart, this greatly limits the precision with which a load can be adjusted, increasing the danger for accidentally overloading cartridges with powder for loads near or at the maximum safe load. With a powder scale, an adjustable powder measure can be calibrated more precisely for the powder in question, and spot checks can be made during loading to make sure that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> not drifting. With a powder trickler, a charge can be measured directly into the scale, giving the most accurate measure.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 the Environment Agency {{announced}} it favours compulsory metering in water-scarce southern England. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> controversial. Consumer groups fear it will penalise poorer families {{with lots of}} children, and the disabled, who use more water. The announcement also represents a U-turn for Labour, which fiercely opposed compulsory water meters when in opposition, describing them as a 'tax on family life'. In March 2006 the company Folkestone & Dover Water Services was granted the power to install compulsory water meters in a landmark ministerial ruling under which it was given 'water scarcity status' by Environment Minister Elliot Morley. In a written ministerial statement, Mr Morley said: 'In {{many parts of the}} country, water is a precious resource which we can no longer simply take for granted.' The company says that Folkestone and Dover are in one of the driest areas in the UK. Many parts of the Middle East had more rain than this area, and it is getting even drier and warmer due to climate change.|$|E

500|$|Norway {{pioneered the}} {{implementation}} of electronic urban tolling in the main corridors of Norway's three major cities: Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and Trondheim (1991). In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect {{is similar to a}} congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> intended to [...] cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and relief traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tonsberg.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) {{scheme that}} went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. [...] there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet this criteria. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> designed to limit {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. Mayor Boris Johnson approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.|$|E
