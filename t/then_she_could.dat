500|$|In Gortyn, epikleroi {{were also}} called patroiokos, {{and they were}} more generously treated than in Athens. The term patroiokos can be {{literally}} translated as [...] "having the father's property", and was {{a description of the}} condition of the heiress. She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living. The relative who had the right to marry her was called a epiballon, and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles. If there were no candidates fitting those conditions, the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose. If she wished, a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance. If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her, she was free to find a spouse in her tribe, or if none was willing, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry whomever she wished. Gortyn may owe the liberality of its heiress laws {{to the fact that it}} was one of the few city-states known to have allowed daughters to inherit even if they had brothers; daughters in Gortyn received half the share of a son. To prevent the abuse of the system, there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her, and if the limit expired, the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes. There was a limit, however, that a man could only marry one heiress. Unlike in Athens, the heiress owned her inheritance and her son did not inherit until she died. Her son was also eligible to inherit from his father.|$|E
2500|$|Allin, {{it must be}} stressed, was a planter, {{and neither}} an indentured nor enslaved worker, and the [...] "freedom and honour" [...] he sought was {{independence}} rather than manumission. Neither was Allin of noble blood, nor was his cause against Willoughby based on love. Therefore, {{the extent to which}} he provides a model for Oroonoko is limited more to his crime and punishment than to his plight. However, if Behn left Surinam in 1663, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have kept up with matters in the colony by reading the Exact Relation that Willoughby had printed in London in 1666, and seen in the extraordinary execution a barbarity to graft onto her villain, Byam, from the man who might have been her real employer, Willoughby.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} the {{procedure}} of [...] applied {{only when the}} captive did not accept the commandments, for if she accepted the commandments, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be immersed in a ritual bath ( [...] , mikveh), and she and the soldier could marry immediately.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1999[...] Rabbi Eliezer interpreted the words [...] "and she shall shave her head and do her nails" [...] in [...] to mean that she was to cut her nails, but Rabbi Akiva interpreted the words to mean that she was to let them grow. Rabbi Eliezer reasoned that [...] specified an act {{with respect to the}} head and an act with respect to the nails, and as the former meant removal, so should the latter. Rabbi Akiva reasoned that [...] specified disfigurement for the head, so it must mean disfigurement for the nails, as well..|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{did you get}} here? Are you alone?" [...] went on Baxter, coming closer. And <b>then</b> before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> answer, he added: [...] "Got {{anything}} to eat?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed in}} the {{direction}} of Casterbridge, and the dog seemed to misunderstand: he trotted on. <b>Then,</b> finding <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not follow, he came back and whined.|$|R
6000|$|Amelia Roper was a tall, well-grown young woman, {{with dark}} hair and dark eyes;--not handsome, for her nose was thick, and {{the lower part of}} her face was heavy, but yet not without some {{feminine}} attractions. Her eyes were bright; but then, also, they were mischievous. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> talk fluently enough; but <b>then,</b> also, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> scold. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> assume sometimes the plumage of a dove; but <b>then</b> again <b>she</b> <b>could</b> occasionally ruffle her feathers like an angry kite. I am quite prepared to acknowledge that John Eames should have kept himself clear of Amelia Roper; but then young men so frequently do those things which they should not do! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{tears came}} {{dropping}} from her eyes, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will love}} you," [...] she said, {{pressing}} his arm still more closely. But even <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not {{bring herself to}} tell him that she did love him.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, she decided, {{it would}} do no harm just to go and LOOK at the building. Perhaps, <b>then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> resign herself to waiting patiently for ten o'clock.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{saw it all}} now--the whole {{scheme to}} lure her to Blentz. Even <b>then,</b> though, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe the king {{had been one of}} the conspirators of the plot.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then,</b> before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> collect her thoughts, Henchard {{went out}} from her rooms, and {{departed}} from the house by the back way as he had come; and she saw him no more.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>then</b> he or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{approach}} {{a court to}} challenge {{the validity of the}} proclamation.|$|R
60|$|But even <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not believe. Something in her, made {{hard by the}} {{intensity}} of her suffering, refused to melt. And her head was throbbing, and she scarcely heard him.|$|E
60|$|And moreover, if now and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have a good}} {{talk with}} someone {{understanding}} and intelligent, someone she could trust, someone who cared {{enough for her to}} think with her and for her....|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Ethel {{with all}} her heart, and hurried away. Nothing was more in favour of Miss Bracy, than {{that there should be}} a hurry. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be warm, and not morbid.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is happiness?" [...] quoth he, much as Pilate {{may have}} {{questioned}} what was truth. <b>Then</b> before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> reply he hastened to add: [...] "I {{have not been}} quite so happy these many years." ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>then</b> before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> add a word, M. de Kercadiou came blustering {{through the}} window, his {{spectacles}} on his forehead, his face inflamed, waving {{in his hand}} [...] "The Acts of the Apostles," [...] and apparently reduced to speechlessness.|$|R
50|$|Garibaldi and Lise {{watch this}} news from a bedroom on Mars. Lise asks when he'll {{have to return}} to Babylon 5. Garibaldi answers he can wait. Lise <b>then</b> notes <b>she</b> <b>could</b> use someone to help her run Edgars Industries, which she now owns.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I shall go for good. I {{have a little}} money by me, which John says I may use, and I shall take a lodging till--till--till--" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not go on any further.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{calculated}} {{she must}} have seen a thousand miners {{in less than two}} miles of the gulch, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not see up the draws and washes that intersected the slope, and she could not see beyond the camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like mine. He is {{not doing}} it so much on his own account as on hers. She wrote and told him {{it would be a}} {{kindness}} to her, since <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry and live respectably. And Jude has agreed." ...|$|E
60|$|Agatha's eyes fell. <b>She</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not look}} at him just <b>then,</b> nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> answer his {{question}} honestly as she almost wished to.|$|R
60|$|Yes, it {{was like}} lead, for, as she watched his face on the pillow her love went out to him. It might have done so even had he been {{disfigured}} like herself; but his was a beautiful countenance of noble outlines, and she felt a certain pride in it as hers, while she longed to see it light up with reason, and glow once more with health. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> rejoice, {{even if there were}} no look of love for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I think you're fonder of me than Tom is," [...] said Maggie. <b>Then,</b> {{wondering}} how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> convince Philip that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> like {{him just as}} well, although he was crooked, she said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never you mind, Baa-baa; I shan't do it; and it's a mean shame Polly can't have half; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{marry you}} and be so happy," [...] blubbered Toady, running {{to try to}} hide his tears of {{disappointment}} in the coat-skirts of his friend.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Mackenzie {{went to her}} desk, {{and brought}} him {{a copy of the}} note she had written to the lawyer. He read it very carefully, twice over; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see, when he refolded the paper, that his eyes were {{glittering}} with satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|Maisie {{waited for}} Sir Claude to {{pronounce}} on this; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only {{understand that he}} on his side waited, and she felt particularly full of common sense as she met her responsibility. [...] "Oh I don't want Susan with YOU!" [...] she said to Mrs. Wix.|$|E
60|$|A few shillings now and <b>then,</b> {{were all}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> earn. The boy worked {{steadily}} on; dying by minutes, but never once giving utterance to complaint or murmur.|$|R
5000|$|Claudia Zepeda as María del Mar Solís, a.k.a. [...] "La Matada" [...] (The Brainy). 15 years old, Aries. She {{loves to}} dance, she dreams {{of being a}} model and love is a main topic in her life. At first, she disliked being pointed out as a [...] "good girl" [...] due to her sweet and fragile appearance, but <b>then</b> <b>she</b> {{realized}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> use it to her own advantage. She lives with her mother, who is a radio host. She's {{a good friend of}} Sofía, whom she admires and frequently visits at her home.|$|R
60|$|We were on {{the wharf}} and she stopped. I stopped. I saw her hands at her bonnet-strings, and I rushed {{between her and the}} brink and took her round the waist with both my arms. She might have drowned me, I felt <b>then,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never have got quit of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{acknowledge}} that I was too hasty; I am sorry for any injustice I {{may have done}} you." [...] Romola spoke these words in a fuller and firmer tone; Tito, she hoped, would look less hard when she had expressed her regret, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say other things.|$|E
6000|$|The logical {{sequence}} {{was no more}} obvious than be fore; but she apparently felt it in her turn as he had felt it in his. She whispered back, [...] "Yes," [...] and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not get out anything more till she entreated in a half-stifled voice, [...] "Oh, don't!" ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{not much}} of a reader; life was, she declared, too short to waste in study; but, when she did take up a book, it was {{generally}} of a nature that most women of her class would have called stiff, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> read it without going to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{say a word}} {{to arrest}} him he was at her side. [...] "Don't!" [...] she said, weakly, as he had bent down and put one arm about her and seized her hands with his {{disengaged}} hand and kissed her--kissed her almost upon her lips. He seemed to do ten things before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think to do one, to leap upon her and take possession.|$|R
50|$|John H Amos hence {{moved to}} Anchor Wharf, Historic Dockyard. When the Dockyard Trust {{acquired}} the submarine HMS Ocelot, John H Amos {{was moved to}} a new berth at which she sat on a submerged lump of concrete. Resultantly holed, she sank at her mooring. Happily, the dockyard trust <b>then</b> agreed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be moored on a free slipway.|$|R
60|$|Things {{went on in}} {{this way}} till the middle of May. Sometimes George was almost angry, and wrote letters that were {{somewhat}} savage; sometimes Caroline would be haughty, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> too <b>could</b> write letters which would tell her mind in good plain set terms. But they were not near enough, or sufficiently often with each other, to quarrel.|$|R
