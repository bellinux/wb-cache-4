40|$|Risk is an {{important}} factor in crop rotation systems and cropping system management studies. The study uses stochastic simulation techniques and Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to Function (SERF) to evaluate five crop rotations risk-efficiency and economic sustainability in Sudan Gezira Scheme. Price and yield risk for five crops were simulated to calculate whole-scheme net return. The analysis shows with the present irrigation system capacity 4 <b>course</b> <b>rotation</b> is the most preferred at lower (ARAC) and the 5 <b>Course</b> <b>rotation</b> (B) with 53 % land use intensity achieve water distribution equity and is the most risk efficient crop rotation at upper (ARAC). It is downside risk oriented and resilience crop rotation. The area allocated in 5 <b>Course</b> <b>rotations</b> (B) for cotton crop is 17 %, wheat 7 %, sorghum 60 %, groundnut 4 % and fodder crops 12 %. Fodder can be grown two times in summer and winter season without creating water shortage problems. However, this will increase net return and increase soil fertilities within the selected crop rotation. The result also shows that return pack to night storage irrigation system needs a risk premium of 36 Million (SDG). The techniques used in this study could be used with any distribution estimates for the uncertain variables to incorporate new crop varieties and research recommendation packages. They also could be modified to account for new information contribution during the decision process and account for dynamic effects and policy adjustment and modification...|$|R

30|$|An {{organizational}} {{learning framework}} {{sheds light on}} specific organizational processes and elements that strongly shape how and why faculty do what they do. Such descriptions {{can act as a}} diagnostic account of curricular decision-making that organizational leaders can use to support or alter particular leverage points (e.g., policies governing <b>course</b> <b>rotations)</b> that can lead to educational improvement (Spillane et al. [2001]). In other words, prior to planning and implementing a reform initiative, educators would be well served to first obtain a diagnostic snapshot of local practice or what Umbach ([2007]), p. 264 calls a ‘roadmap’ that leaders should use to guide their efforts.|$|R
30|$|In delving {{more deeply}} into the {{specific}} processes of organizational learning, Huber ([1991]) argued that researchers should {{think in terms of}} information acquisition, distribution, processes of interpretation, and memory functions. In particular, organizational memory, or what Levitt and March ([1988]) call the recording and conservation of experience, is perhaps the most critical part of the learning process. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that most organizations experience personnel turnover and regular upheavals (e.g., <b>course</b> <b>rotation</b> procedures) that make the storage of information critical because newcomers will draw upon these storehouses of information to guide their behavior.|$|R
