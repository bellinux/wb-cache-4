5|$|Many early Russian principalities were {{virtually}} razed or severely {{affected by a}} major Mongol invasion in the 13th century, but the lands of Belarus avoided <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion and were eventually absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|On October27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last {{reported}} {{its location}} {{to the south}} of Guanaja, while trying to escape <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. The United States Coast Guard searched until November4, when they observed the debris from the ship. All 31 people on board were presumed killed.|$|E
50|$|As the CI {{increasingly}} incorporated black African radicals like Steve Biko, Naudé had to bear <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> harassment by <b>the</b> {{state security}} police. The state eventually forced the CI {{to close in}} 1977.|$|R
500|$|The {{insurgents in}} <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> {{operations}} destroyed villages to deny supplies and shelter to the Germans who were operating in mountainous terrain with snow up to [...] deep and facing extreme temperatures approaching [...] The Partisans proved {{very difficult to}} pin down, aided by excellent communication {{and supported by the}} local populace. During the operation, the decisive engagements with the Partisans were mainly in the Romanija region. The Romanija Detachment made up forty percent of all Partisans in eastern Bosnia and bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting during the operation.|$|R
50|$|However, {{most of it}} was {{destroyed}} in <b>the</b> earthquake <b>of</b> 2000. Sinugra Village being very near to Anjar also bore <b>the</b> heavy <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quake and almost all old majestic houses built around 100 years ago were completely destroyed. There was also a good number of human casualty. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old buildings, temples, Chabutro have been since re-constructed but the majestic houses with fine workmanship have been lost.|$|R
5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and {{stating that the}} difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and the finished product made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path was widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E
5|$|Following the armistice, the Australian Mounted Division {{went into}} camp at Tripoli while the Anzac Mounted Division, having borne <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire campaign, {{suffered}} heavily from malaria and influenza in the Jordan Valley. Australia's {{role in the}} Sinai and Palestine campaign was later acknowledged by Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, who had been commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Middle East, as having been considerable. Total Australian battle casualties in the campaign were 4,851, including 1,374 dead.|$|E
50|$|Eventually <b>the</b> full <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm hits {{with its}} most {{destructive}} forces taking out many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's systems.

5|$|Keith's {{slow and}} erratic {{movement}} {{caused it to}} produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding. Several other countries reported significant but less severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|National governments, {{domestic}} non-governmental organizations, {{and international}} aid agencies established hundreds of shelters, evacuated {{hundreds of thousands}} of people, raised millions of dollars of resources, and rallied thousands of rescue workers as the powerful hurricane churned through the Caribbean. Despite a number of near misses, Hurricane Dean did not make landfall in the Greater Antilles and the islands were spared <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|Texas bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, where {{strong winds}} and heavy {{rainfall}} damaged about 3,000homes and knocked downed numerous trees and signs. Chantal also spawned two tornadoes, one in Crystal Beach, Texas {{and the other}} in Acadia Parish, Louisiana; both of which caused minor damage. Additionally, 13fatalities occurred, all of them due to drowning; 11deaths occurred offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining two were reported in east-central Texas. Overall, the storm resulted in at least $100million (1989USD) in damage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the coastal}} {{community}} Guiuan, which took <b>the</b> full <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typhoon, Mayor Christopher Gonzalez {{is credited with}} saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate. He referred to the storm as [...] "delubyo (deluge)," [...] which roughly translates to Armageddon. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> town's 45,000 residents, 87 died, 931 were injured, and 23 others were listed as missing. U.S. Navy Capt. Russell Hays, a medical officer, estimated that a storm of Haiyan's caliber could have killed as many as 4,500 in Guiuan alone {{had it not been}} for the mayor's efforts.|$|R
40|$|EGYPT ON <b>THE</b> OUTBREAK <b>OF</b> WAR 1916 On 6 November 1914, {{after three}} months of {{steadily}} worsening relations, France and Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire.

5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm would take a more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in County Galway closed markets {{for the duration of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|By 9 April, the {{pressure}} was decreasing on the New Zealand positions as the Germans shifted their offensive north to the area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{that of the}} 12 million with private insurance via the ACA exchanges in 2017, about 10 million receive premium tax credit subsidies and will be shielded from premium increases, as their after-subsidy premiums are limited {{as a percentage of}} income under the ACA. However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E

5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E

He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will bear <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>The</b> next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph {{can come back to}} life unharmed.

5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to bear <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captain's rages.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tropical}} cyclone's {{damage was}} inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result}} of the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} the damage {{occurred}} {{on the island of}} Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced <b>the</b> <b>brunt</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.|$|E
