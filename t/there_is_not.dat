5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin.

5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E

The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E

In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507.

5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E
5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself {{and all its}} other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E

These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior insulation and ventilation for their inhabitants.|$|E
