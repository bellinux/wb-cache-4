5|$|Although {{the main}} {{objective}} is to navigate <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> worlds to {{reach the end of}} the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes.

5|$|M-50 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. Although designated as an east–west highway, it is nearly a diagonal northwest–southeast route.

In between the trunkline runs <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> counties of {{the southern part of the}} Lower Peninsula mostly through rural farm fields and small communities. The highway also runs through downtown Jackson to connect between two freeway sections of US127.

After the World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7World Trade Center.

He did not allow a single hit to the Athletics <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game now had to span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the official record books.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{bright spot}} for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in {{what had been a}} much {{anticipated}} pitching match-up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martínez. Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> innings of work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 13–1 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves, (including two 8th-inning comebacks). The loss to Pedro Martínez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.|$|E

In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. Offers soon started to pour in, and he accepted one from St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and a textbook, Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary casting began during March 1987, and {{the main}} cast was {{announced}} on May 15. The initial press release highlighted the casting of LeVar Burton, known for appearing in the miniseries Roots, as Geordi La Forge. Burton had auditioned for the role following a suggestion from executive producer Robert H. Justman, who had previously worked {{with him on a}} TV movie. The only other two members of the cast mentioned were Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker. Stewart was cast in the lead role after being spotted by Justman at a dramatic reading at the University of California, Los Angeles. However, the show's creator, Roddenberry, wanted a French actor and was considering the role of Data for Stewart. Both Justman and Berman campaigned for Stewart to have the part of Captain Picard, and Roddenberry relented. Frakes became Roddenberry's favorite for the role of Riker after the actor went <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> auditions for the role.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Braves then visited Philadelphia for {{a four-game}} series. In game one, Hernandez {{started for the}} Phillies and Ervin Santana for the Braves. After a pitchers' duel <b>through</b> <b>seven</b> innings, the Braves hit back-to-back-to-back home runs {{in the top of}} the eighth before the Phillies rallied with five runs in the bottom of the inning (a two-RBI single by Byrd and a three-run home run by Domonic Brown) for a 6–5 lead {{entering}} the ninth. Since Papelbon had pitched in the previous three games, he was unavailable as a closer. Jake Diekman pitched the ninth inning, allowing a grand slam by Dan Uggla for a final score of 9–6. Jackie Robinson Day, scheduled to be celebrated by the Phillies and Braves on April 15, was postponed to the following day when the game was rained out. On April 16 Lee pitched nine innings, striking out 13 batters and giving up one run for a 1–0 loss. In the series' last game, Burnett pitched seven shutout innings in a scoreless game before Ben Revere hit an RBI single in the eighth; Papelbon pitched a scoreless ninth inning for the save in the 1–0 win.
