25|$|J. B. Rhine's {{experiments}} with Zener cards were discredited {{due to the}} discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being {{able to read the}} symbols {{from the back of the}} cards and being able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.|$|E

25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of these people do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the band.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} and most {{successful}} of Boughton's works is the opera The Immortal Hour, {{an adaptation of}} the play by Fiona Macleod (the pseudonym of William Sharp) based on Celtic mythology. Having been successful in Glastonbury and well received in Birmingham, {{the director of the}} then new Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Barry Jackson, decided to take the Glastonbury Festival Players' production to London where it achieved the record breaking run of over 600 performances. On its arrival at the Regent Theatre in 1922, it secured an initial run of over 200 consecutive performances and a further 160 in 1923, with a highly successful revival in 1932. People came to see the opera {{on more than one occasion}} (including members of the Royal family) and especially <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the young Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies whose portrayal as Etain began her professional acting career.|$|E
25|$|Other {{adjustments}} that CBS made {{in hopes}} of improving its coverage included hiring reporter Sonny Hill to cover the league on a full-time basis. CBS also put microphones and cameras on team huddles to allow viewers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> coaches at work. Finally, CBS introduced a halftime segment called Red Auerbach on Roundball, featuring the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics coach. The segment intended to not only educate CBS' viewers about {{the complexities of the}} pro game, but also to teach young players how to improve their skills. They also subtly introduced audiences to an all-star team based on Auerbach's criteria such as screening and passing. In a Red on Roundball halftime segment which appeared on CBS' NBA telecasts in the 1973–74 season, Auerbach and referee Mendy Rudolph discussed and demonstrated the practice of flopping with obvious disapproval.|$|E
500|$|One {{of those}} who {{addressed}} the design problem was Lewis Miller. [...] A wealthy inventor and industrialist, Miller supervised a Sunday school in Canton, Ohio, and later one in Akron. [...] When the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Akron decided to construct a new building, Miller worked with several architects to plan the Sunday-school wing. [...] He devised a plan in which wedge-shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating {{from the direction of}} a central superintendent's platform. [...] Doors on the platform-facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade-separated lessons, or opened to allow all pupils <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the superintendent during school-wide exercises. [...] The new church, following these plans, was constructed in 1866–67.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in history, the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of National Mall, which extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, as the public viewing area for the {{swearing-in}} ceremony. The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S.Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event. The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event [...] "'the most open and accessible in history,' allowing those who [...] get the [...] tickets to the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall".

500|$|Physically, kitsune {{are noted}} for having {{as many as}} nine tails. Generally, {{a greater number of}} tails {{indicates}} an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These [...] gain the abilities <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience).

In April 2014 she gave concert performances in Australia. The reviewer for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "Perhaps {{it is a matter}} of personality as much as voice: a natural warmth and an instinct for never exaggerating the emotional content of a song. Whatever the case, it is easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> why, for 30 years, Bernadette Peters has probably been musical theatre's finest performer. ... She even breathed new life into 'Send In the Clowns'. ... Rather than make it emotionally swollen (as so many do), Peters contracted it, delicately squeezing out its essence like toothpaste from a near-empty tube." [...] She gave concerts in June 2016 in the UK at the Royal Festival Hall, Manchester Opera House and Edinburgh Playhouse.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening night}} {{audience}} was also delighted by the piece, preferring it {{even to the}} Offenbach work: [...] "To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary {{on the part of}} the audience, Trial by Jury suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [...] [...] On the contrary, it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm." [...] A reviewer noted that [...] "Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action ...to a temporary standstill." [...] Another paper summed up its popular appeal: [...] "Trial by Jury is but a trifle–it pretends to be nothing more–but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear,</b> which they will laugh at, and which they will advise their friends to go and see, and therefore its success cannot be doubtful." ...|$|E

Dual Destinies also introduces [...] "revisualization", where the player reviews vital facts and forms links between evidence to reach new conclusions. Spirit of Justice introduces [...] "divination séances", in which the player is shown the memories of victims moments before their deaths, and must find contradictions in the victim's five senses to determine what has happened. Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney introduces simultaneous cross-examinations of multiple witnesses, with the player being able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> reactions from the different witnesses to the testimony and using this to find contradictions.

[...] The train bearing The Idler pulled in after a short journey from the last stop, and after he was greeted by local dignitaries, Bryan would give a brief speech addressing silver {{and the need for}} the people to retake the government.

By {{the end of the}} year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on The Ed Sullivan Show to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: [...] "In the states I know I went over well. It knocked me out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads." [...] He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's [...] "I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye" [...] and Rolf Harris's [...] "Ringo for President". In 1964, [...] "I love Ringo" [...] lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising. Furthermore, Starr's insistence on prominently placing the logo of the company that made his prize American import drum kit, Ludwig Drums, on his bass drum gave it a such burst of publicity that the company became a dominant manufacturer of drums for twenty years.|$|E
