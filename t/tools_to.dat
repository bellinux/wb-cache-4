5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
