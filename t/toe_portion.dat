50|$|Look's Nevada, {{released}} in 1950, {{was the first}} recognizably modern alpine ski binding. The Nevada was only the <b>toe</b> <b>portion</b> of the binding, and was used with a conventional cable binding for the heel. An updated version was introduced in 1962 with a new step-in heel binding, the Grand Prix. These basic mechanisms {{formed the basis for}} LOOK bindings for over 40 years, changing mainly in name and construction materials. The Nevada toe pattern is almost universal among bindings today.|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of a foot restraint platform designed primarily for use by an astronaut being rigidly and permanently attached to an end effector which is suitable for attachment to the manipulator arm of a remote manipulating system is described. The foot restraint platform is attached by a brace to the end effector at a location away from the grappling interface of the end effector. The platform comprises a support plate provided {{with a pair of}} stirrups for receiving the <b>toe</b> <b>portion</b> of an astronaut's boots when standing on the platform and a pair of heel retainers in the form of raised members which are fixed {{to the surface of the}} platform and located to provide abutment surfaces for abutting engagement with the heels of the astronaut's boots when his toes are in the stirrups. The heel retainers preclude a backward sliding movement of the feet on the platform and instead require a lifting of the heels in order to extract the feet. The brace for attaching the foot restraint platform to the end effector may include a pivot or swivel joint to permit various orientations of the platform with respect to the end effector...|$|E
30|$|Meanwhile, direct {{measurements}} of in-situ {{strength of a}} décollement or surrounding formations have not been conducted due to the difficulty in determining the in-situ stress state. It remains unknown whether the subducting sediments beneath a décollement are mechanically weak as suggested by seismic imaging data. Recently, a data processing approach was proposed by Hamada et al. (2018) to evaluate in-situ formation strength (equivalent strength, EST). The EST is an improvement of the commonly used mechanical specific energy (MSE) which is the drilling strength calculated from drilling parameters such as weight-on-bit (WOB), top drive torque (Tr), and rotations per minute (RPM) (Bevilacqua et al. 2013; Dupriest and Koederitz 2005; Teale 1965). An evaluation of EST was undertaken at site C 0002 in the IODP Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Drilling Project (NanTro SEIZE). A continuous strength profile {{to a depth of}} 3000 meters below the seafloor (mbsf) was obtained and used to describe the lithology (Hamada et al. 2018). This method allowed estimation of the strength without assuming uncertain in-situ conditions (e.g., stress and fluid pressure conditions). Here, we applied the EST method to drilling data obtained from IODP Expedition 370 at the Nankai Trough to evaluate the continuous in-situ strength across the <b>toe</b> <b>portion</b> of the plate boundary fault and to show the actual situation of the subducting materials beneath the décollement.|$|E
40|$|We compare {{data from}} three {{deep-seated}} gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) where palaeoseismological techniques were applied in artificial trenches. At all trenches, located in metamorphic rocks of the Italian Alps, {{there is evidence}} of extensional deformation given by normal movements along slip planes dipping downhill or uphill, and/or fissures, as expected in gravitational failure. However, we document and illustrate - with the aid of trenching - evidence of reverse movements. The reverse slips occurred mostly along the same planes along which normal slip occurred, and they produced drag folds in unconsolidated Holocene sediments as well as the superimposition of substrate rocks on Holocene sediments. The studied trenches indicate that reverse slip might occur not only at the <b>toe</b> <b>portions</b> of DSGSDs but also in their central-upper portions. When the age relationships between the two deformation kinematics can be determined, they clearly indicate that reverse slips postdate normal ones. Our data suggest that, during the development of long-lived DSGSDs, inversion kinematics may occur in different sectors of the unstable rock mass. The inversion is interpreted as due either to locking of the frontal blocks of a DSGSD or to the relative decrease in the rate of downward movement in the frontal blocks with respect to the rear blocks...|$|R
50|$|While a {{fine grain}} master appears {{over-exposed}} and dark, it contains {{all of the information}} in the original negative, compressed into the <b>toe</b> and straight-line <b>portion</b> of the H&D curve via exposure and chemical processing. The image is uncompressed when the duplicate negative is made from the element and the tonal range expanded up into the top straight-line and shoulder portion of the H&D curve.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} the three-axis ground reaction force (GRF) distribution during straight walking. Small three-axis force sensors composed of rubber and sensor chips were fabricated and calibrated. After sensor calibration, 16 force sensors {{were attached to}} the left shoe. The three-axis force distribution during straight walking was measured, and the local features of the three-axis force under the sole of the shoe were analyzed. The heel area {{played a role in}} receiving the braking force, the base area of the fourth and fifth toes applied little vertical or shear force, the base area of the second and third <b>toes</b> generated a <b>portion</b> of the propulsive force and received a large vertical force, and the base area of the big toe helped move the body’s center of mass to the other foot. The results demonstrate that measuring the three-axis GRF distribution is useful for a detailed analysis of bipedal locomotion...|$|R
40|$|After a {{long period}} of quiescence, in mid-November 1994 a large ancient slope movement, over 3000 m long, 1000 m wide and up to 120 m deep, {{classified}} as a slow, intermittent complex-type landslide resumed its activity, striking the village of Corniglio in the Parma Apennines (Northern Italy). The movement developed within arenaceous, calcareous and clayey geological formations and consisted of multiple roto-translational slides in the upper and middle portion and translational slides in the <b>toe</b> <b>portion</b> associated with earth flows. The causes of the landslide are ascribable to decrease of geomechanical parameters, owing to weathering and seismic activity, and increase of porewater pressures, after periods of intense rainfall. In 1995, during a phase of quiescence, the following works were carried out: thousands of trees displaced by the landslide were cut down, new topographic mapping of the landslide body was performed, the runoff network was re-established and draining trenches were dug to a depth of 12 m. Early in 1996, after a 4. 2 magnitude seismic shock hit the area, large new detachments occurred along rotational surfaces of rupture. In February 1996, the formation of tension cracks in the ground and fissures in several buildings and streets of the village followed mass re-mobilisation of the ancient landslide body. Considering the landslide size and complexity, effective remedial measures seem to be rather uncertain and, in any case, very expensive. Nevertheless, monitoring equipment will be further improved with the setting up of fixed inclinometers and electric piezometers with automatic data acquisition to safeguard the most important built-up area...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2011, Brainard was {{replaced}} by guitarist Jeff Walter. In 2012, after playing two dates each in both Portland and Seattle, the band embarked on a five-week tour of Europe during June and July. The tour spanned eleven countries and featured the band playing nearly thirty dates in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. During this tour, Jerry developed a severe infection in his foot and was instructed by medical staff in Europe to return home immediately. Despite a long-standing reputation for not completing tours, the band remained in Europe for the entire five weeks, resulting in Jerry having to have two <b>toes</b> and a <b>portion</b> of his foot removed when the band returned to the U.S. [...] The European tour of 2012 {{was the last time}} Cuthbert and Hume played with the band. Via social media, the band announced that {{they were looking for a}} new rhythm section and tried out various drummers and bass players during 2013 and 2013.|$|R
40|$|Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to introduce the feasibility of toe tissue transfer withoutvenous outflow for fingertip reconstruction. Methods Five cases of fingertip defects were treated successfully with this method. Four caseswere traumatic fingertip defects, and one case was a hook-nail deformity. The lateral pulp ofa great <b>toe</b> or medioinferior <b>portion</b> of a second toe was used as the donor site. An arterialpedicle was dissected only within the digit and anastomosis was performed within 2 cm aroundthe defect margin. The digital nerve was repaired simultaneously. No additional dissectionof the dorsal or volar pulp vein was performed in either the donor or recipient sites. Othersurgical procedures were performed following conventional techniques. Postoperative venouscongestion was monitored with pulp temperature, color, and degree of tissue oxygen saturation. Venous congestion was decompressed with a needle-puncture method intermittently, but didnot require continuous external bleeding for salvage. Results Venous congestion was observed in all the flaps, but improved within 3 or 4 dayspostoperatively. The flap size was from 1. 5 × 1. 5 cm 2 to 2. 0 × 3. 0 cm 2. The mean surgical timewas 2 hours and 20 minutes. A needle puncture was carried out every 2 hours during the firstpostoperative day, and then every 4 hours thereafter. The amount of blood loss during eachpuncture procedure was less than 0. 2 mL. In the long-term follow-up, no flap atrophy wasobserved. Conclusions When used properly, the free toe tissue transfer without venous anastomosismethod can be a treatment option for small defects on the fingertip area...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) {{infections are}} a growing public health problem, with {{increasing}} prevalence, poor response to antibiotics and bacterial resistance to traditional antimicrobials leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Bacteriophages (phages), the viruses that target specific bacteria, are one option for addressing bacterial infections, especially where antibiotics fail. Of particular value is {{a class of}} virulent staphylococcal phages that hit almost all Staphylococcus aureus, including most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Here we report a continuous case series assessing the effectiveness of treating infected and poorly vascularised toe ulcers with exposed bone, after failure of recommended antibiotic therapy, using topically applied Staphylococcus aureus-specific phage. METHOD: This was a compassionate-use case series of nine patients with diabetes and poorly perfused toe ulcers containing culture-proven Staphylococcus aureus infected bone and soft tissue, who had responded poorly to recommended antibiotic therapy. Six representative cases are presented here. The only generally accepted other option in each case was <b>toe</b> amputation. Exposed <b>portions</b> of the infected phalanges were removed in three cases and left in place in two cases. One case presented as a micro-clot induced gangrene following vascular stenting. In this case, phage were used to prevent infection. The phage used was a commercially available fully sequenced preparation of staphylococcal phage Sb- 1. Phage solution was applied topically to the ulcerations once weekly, following standard good wound care. The amount of phage solution applied varied from 0. 1 to 0. 5 cc depending on volume and area of the ulceration. RESULTS: All infections responded to the phage applications and the ulcers healed in an average of seven weeks with infected bone debridement. One ulcer, where vascularity was extremely poor and bone was not removed to preserve hallux function, required 18 weeks of treatment. In {{the case of the}} toe with the micro-clot gangrene, the toe was salvaged and healed in seven weeks without complications. CONCLUSION: Topical application of a staph mono-phage preparation can be used successfully to treat infected toe ulcerations with bone involvement, despite very poor vascularity and failure of antibiotic treatment. The success within this small series provides the groundwork for controlled clinical trials of staph phage for diabetic foot infections. status: publishe...|$|R
