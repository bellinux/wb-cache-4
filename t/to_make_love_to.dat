Crazy jumps off the rooftop, landing on Solly, killing himself and Solly. As Roz calls up a radio station to make a memorial request in honor of Vinnie, he stands up and walks away, leaving Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked {{in front of him and}} pleading with him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.|$|E

25|$|Succumbing to Leander's soft words, {{and to his}} {{argument}} that Aphrodite, as goddess of love, would scorn the worship of a virgin, Hero allowed him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her. This routine lasted through the warm summer. But one stormy winter night, the waves tossed Leander in {{the sea and the}} breezes blew out Hero's light, and Leander lost his way, and was drowned. Hero threw herself from the tower in grief and died as well. The name Maiden's Tower might also have its origins in this ancient story.|$|E

25|$|Pony was Elbryan's {{childhood}} friend. When {{their village}} {{was attacked by}} goblins, {{they were the only}} survivors. The horrors witnessed by Pony broke her mind and she was unable to remember what had happened. She was adopted by a family of Palmaris, the Chilichunks, and slowly started to regain her memory. She married a young nobleman named Connor but all her attempts to love him made the dark memories of her past return. Although patient at first, Connor cracked when she refused <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> him on their wedding night and he tried to rape her. However, he stopped just in time and broke off the marriage. He gave Pony a way out by offering to let her join the army which she accepted.

500|$|... "Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] {{represents}} Waters' recording {{transition from}} an electrified, but more traditional Delta-based blues {{of the late}} 1940s–early 1950s to a newer Chicago blues ensemble sound. [...] The song was important to Dixon's career and signaled a change as well – Chess became convinced of Dixon's value as a songwriter and secured his relationship as such with the label. [...] Waters soon followed up with several variations on the sixteen-bar stop-time arrangement written by Dixon. [...] These include [...] "I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Make</b> <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> You", [...] "I'm Ready", and [...] "I'm a Natural Born Lover". [...] All of these songs follow a similar lyrical theme and [...] "helped shape Muddy Waters' image as the testosterone king of the blues", according to Gioia.|$|E
500|$|Thierrée was {{the only}} actor allowed to improvise. His {{characterisation}} of Taloche was built on spontaneity, and in many instances, Gatlif had no clue how he would act in a scene, such as in [...] the tap scene in which he plunges into a stairwell. In another scene, in which he dances with war music in the background, Thierrée pretended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> the earth like an animal. Gatlif, who had wanted the character {{to have the ability}} to [...] sense forthcoming danger, like animals often do, stated that Thierrée was suitable [...] for the role because he is very much an animal. The dance scene where Taloche is shown falling from a tree was done without stunt doubles.|$|E

[...] It soon became the biggest hit of Waters' career. [...] The single entered Billboard magazine's Rhythm & Blues Records charts on March 13, 1954, and reached number three on the Juke Box chart and number eight on the Best Seller chart. [...] It remained on the charts for 13 weeks, making it Waters' longest charting record {{up to that time}} (two more Waters-Dixon songs, [...] "Just Make Love to Me (I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Make</b> <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> You") and [...] "Close to You", both later also lasted 13 weeks).|$|E

Her marriage as a teenager ended almost immediately {{with the realization that}} [...] "when men try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> me, something in me fights". Although acknowledging the term [...] "homosexual" [...] in describing others, Murray preferred to describe herself as having an [...] "inverted sex instinct" [...] that caused her to behave as a man attracted to women would. She wanted a [...] "monogamous married life", but one in which she was the man. The majority of her relationships were with women whom she described as [...] "extremely feminine and heterosexual". In her younger years, Murray often was devastated by the end of these relationships, to the extent that she was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment twice, in 1937 and in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Cosimo, {{not having}} {{much else to}} do, instituted more moral laws.

[...] If a man did not comply, he was liable to receive enormous fines. This coincided with a new wave of taxes that stagnated Tuscany's already declining economy. Harold Acton recounts that a bale of wool [...] "sent from Leghorn and Cortona had to pass though ten intermediate customs." [...] The Grand Duke oversaw the establishment of the Office of Public Decency, whose goal was to regulate prostitution, also. Prostitutes were oft thrown into the Stinche, a jail for women of that profession, for years, with scant food, if they could not afford the fines levied on them by the Office of Public Decency. Evening permits and exemptions were available for those willing to pay six crowns per month.|$|E

As she continues to caress her upper-body, an array of light imagery is projected behind her, serving as a backdrop. During the second verse, the video begins to use symmetrical visual arts. Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears trickling down her cheeks are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling down her cheeks, Beyoncé chants to her love interest <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E

The elder Stephen sees the young man start off on an auto trip with some gay friends, and decides to call a halt. He notifies his son by telegram {{that it is time}} he went to work, and presents him with the factory. This arouses the merriment of his friends, but Hal declares that he will buckle down and go to work. He tells his father, however, that he desires to start incognito, and the father consents. Hal enters the factory and goes to work as an ordinary laborer, his identity being unknown to all. He meets Lou, a young working girl, and falls in love with her. The manager of the place, one Conners, tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> Lou, and Hal protects her. There is an order put up reducing salaries 10%, and Lou induces the others to strike rather than to submit. The strikers, starved out, finally return to work, with the exception of Lou, who is defiant to the end. Hal finds her weeping on the steps of her home and tells her of his love. She agrees to marry him. After she has accepted him, he leads her to the factory, announces his identity, assumes possession, and restores wages to the old scale, after having discharged the rogue Conners." ...|$|E

5000|$|This obsequious {{compliment}} {{need not}} be taken seriously. Later Augustan poets tended {{to distance themselves from}} the world of high politics, and often drew a humorous contrast between the martial ambition of their ruler and their own ignoble love affairs.
