40|$|One of {{the main}} {{disturbances}} of the machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> is caused by operation of motion axis. Movement of high dynamic motion axis is connected with powerful force strokes that excite machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> vibration and deteriorate machining surface quality and productivity. There are several possibilities how to suppress this vibration. One possibility is to use suspended motor, where the motor is connected with the machine body by spring and damper. This paper deals with new more advanced conception where the main motor is connected with the frame by an active element, that is controlled by intelligent control technique. The active element represents another linear motor, therefore the conception is shortly called “motor on motor”...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{modularization}} {{of machine}} <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> is an approach when designing new machine tool structures in a sustainable context. By integration of microsystem technology and designing lightweight modules, a smart alternative to conventional machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> is developed. In previous studies, this concept has been evaluated {{along with a}} compilation of the possible use-case scenarios and the potential benefits from using modular electronics. In the presented paper, the geometric requirements from the selected use-case scenarios for machine tool structures are identified by dividing the structures in their ideal mechanic equivalents. A set of rules is developed driven by the generalized geometric requirements of the machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames.</b> Three different approaches of polyhedral building sets are shown and evaluated for their merits based on criteria of geometric functionality and sustainability. Finally, a prototypical modular portal frame is presented for the proof of concept...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for reusable and adaptable machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> is the modularization {{of the frame}} structure by breakdown to hexagonal primitives. The design of small light weight modules allows for the assembly of a high variation of different geometries and enables scalable structures. However, a core issue in designing modular products is the proper definition of interfaces within the own product family and the outside, by which the usability and flexibility of the modular structure is mainly influenced. In the context of modular machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames,</b> conventional mechanical criteria like stiffness, reliability and cost are key factors when designing new joining techniques. Taking sustainability into account, additional aspects of social, economic and ecologic dimension become important. This paper presents a study on reusable connection principles for modular machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> and gives an evaluation according to sustainability criteria by using a fuzzy analytical network process...|$|R

Within this study an innovative approach of modular machine tool frames (MMTF) equipped with micro system technology is presented that aims at enhancing flexibility of mutable production processes. This new approach extends the existing reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS). MMTF {{goes beyond the}} platform approach via minimizing the machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> parts used for the building block system of manufacturing cells.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} how seam-tracking {{sensors can be}} integrated in a robotic laser welding system for automatic teaching of the seam trajectory {{as well as for}} correcting small errors from a pre-defined seam trajectory. Calibration procedures are required to derive accurate transformations of laser and sensor tool frames relative to each other or relative to the robot flange. A tool calibration procedure is described that involves movements of the tool above a special calibration object. The accuracy of this procedure is influenced by errors in the robot movement. Therefore, another calibration procedure is developed, which is a direct measurement of the sensor <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> relative to the laser <b>tool</b> <b>frame.</b> A trajectory-based control approach is presented for real-time seam tracking, where a seam-tracking sensor measures ahead of the laser focal point. In this control approach, sensor measurements are related to the robot position to build a geometric seam trajectory, which is followed by the laser focal poin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{design and}} {{instrumentation}} of force feedback (FF) is presented for a networked telerobotic system {{that consists of}} a Master Arm Client Station (MACS) and a Slave Arm Server Station (SASS). A motion coordination system maps the operator hand at MACS, to a user defined floating <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> at SASS. Variational analysis for a wrist force sensor allows evaluating the force at a floating point of the <b>tool</b> <b>frame.</b> Force is streamed from SASS to MACS where it is displayed on the operator hand. Performance evaluation of contact with the environment is presented. First, a user-controlled teleoperation with FF is described. Contact instabilities are observed in pre-contact and post-contact phases. Second, a programmed compliance loop is implemented at SASS by selectively converting sensed forces into corrective motion which allows minimizing contact forces. Third, a supervisory mechanism based on a user-controlled Active Compliance is presented. High FF gain improves operator sensitivity but may cause instability {{in the case of}} contact with stiff environment. Motion mapping minimizes the number of trials to set up the tool configuration. Light and stiff arms are highly recommended to reduce the degradation in telerobotic synchronization caused by elasticity in linkage transmission and by the network delays. Active compliance at the slave arm improved contact stability and provided an effective supervisory control.

40|$|A design {{concept for}} highly {{dynamical}} micro milling machine tools is introduced. It intends lighter and more compact frames by compensating the dynamic dislocation. For this, the machine tool drives {{are used in}} combination with NC integrated real time simulation of the machine tool. The Dynamic dislocation is increased by a compliant design of the machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame.</b> This leads to a dislocation with lower dynamics making compensation accessible.

DDD allows to edit a complex differential equation-based specification of dynamic robot behavior via an intuitive graphical interface and automatically generates microcontroller code in C as well as a simulation model in Java from it. Speed-up of the tool design process is primarily achieved by a rigorous top-down tool modeling approach in combination with a highly configurable <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> generator. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this article, we {{consider}} the problem of modeling the tool for large-size composite airframe structures production by vacuum infusion technology {{taking into account the}} difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of used materials. The decision of thermal expansion compatibility questions is necessary to minimize deviation of a form-building surface from its initial shape and an exception of a stringer set detachment from a prepreg layer during the production process. We’ve made static structural analysis of heated infusion tool using ANSYS software and solve the thermal expansion harmonization problem by finding the correct connection type for rods between form-building surface and <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> as well as the correct connection type for stringer tool fixing. These recommendations allow to meet the imposed constrains to precision of details production with method of vacuum infusion...|$|E
40|$|Firstly, the {{technological}} capability {{of increasing the}} jerk values for the machine tool axes movement is investigated in this paper analytically and in experimental studies for micro milling. Following this, the influence of different jerk values on surface topography and roughness has been investigated {{with a set of}} experiments. Secondly, the demands on the design of machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> for the realisation of high jerk values are discussed and a new concept for micro milling machine <b>tool</b> <b>frames</b> is proposed. The concept is based on a mechanical structure as the frame, which is of a stiff design in the direction perpendicular to the respective machine tool axis and of a compliant design {{in the direction of the}} respective machine tool axis. The compliancy allows for compensation of the dynamic dislocation by use of correction movements of the machine tool axes. An open control system is used capable of integrating complex models of the mechanical structure. These models and additional sensors are evaluated simultaneously during machine tool run time so that they become part of the machine tool control. A test setup is shown, representing a single machine tool axis with a compliant base. The dynamic dislocation has been compensated by integrating a laser interferometer and a mathematical model of the dislocation has been integrated...|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} of vector spaces, {{one of the most}} {{important}} concepts is that of a basis. By helping of basis we know all about element of that vector spaces, also we know that every element of vector spaces can be obtained by uniquely linear combination of basis elements. However, the conditions to a basis are very restrictive: we require that the elements are linearly independent, and very often we even want them to be orthogonal with respect to inner product. This makes it hard or even impossible to find bases satisfying extra conditions, and this is the reason that one might wish to look for a more flexible tool. As an example, if we take R 3 (R) then we can find basis easily. But if we take l ∞, c [a,b] then we can not find easily but it has basis. From this difficulty, we wish to look for more flexible <b>tool.</b> <b>Frames</b> are such type of <b>tool.</b> A <b>frames</b> for a vector space equipped with an inner product also allow each vector in the space to be written as a linear combination of the elements in the frame.

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} to materials selection theory aims at developing methodological methods and tools to analyse {{a complex set}} of material requirements with the objective of forecast whether there are materials that can fulfil it, or alternatively, if multi-materials selection is more likely to provide a solution. This "pre-analysis" of requirements examines the two main reasons which may prevent a single material solution: nonuniformity of materials space filling, or intrinsic contradiction between properties. A variety of statistical tools is used, based on Multivariate Analysis Methods as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the estimation of density distribution in the materials space. These tools allow to evaluate the "statistical compatibility" between the requirements and the available materials, and provides an estimate of the likelihood to find a single material solution or not.

40|$|International audienceAfter translation, {{the first}} stages {{traditionally}} {{involved in the}} materials selection are filtration and classification, which require formulation of criteria (constraints or objectives) deduced from information written in the set Of material requirements. These criteria, which {{are representative of the}} behavior of the material and the studied structure, must be formulated analytically in order to be used during selection stage. However, for complex behavior, analytical processing of models is no longer possible and it can be replaced by a combination of numerical resolution methods and an optimization method which make it possible to obtain approximate formal expressions of the criteria. In this paper, a complete selection method is proposed. The method is applied to the constraints as well as the objectives, in order to carry out the filtration and classification stages at the same time. The study of the thermomechanical behavior of a machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> has been used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|NOVELTY - Struts (2, 5, 7) {{forming the}} machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> are {{arranged}} symmetrically round the main axis {{to draw off}} the main axial forces for maximum stiffness, and the main axis is coupled to the force input tripod-type component (1) through struts (2) which are mounted at one axial end of the base frame so as to reach out from here to the tripod. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The struts should be slightly angled at 4 - 15 deg. {{in relation to the}} component and surround the main axis symmetrically at 120 deg.. The tripod takes a device to produce a force at an angle to the main axis and the base frame struts (5) of the frame run parallel to the main axis and are straddled by bearer plates (4,).

40|$|In {{machining}} process, fixture {{is used to}} {{keep the}} position and orientation of a workpiece with respect to machine <b>tool</b> <b>frame.</b> However, the workpiece always cannot be at its ideal position because of the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of the locators, clamping force, cutting force, and so on. It is necessary to predict and control the workpiece locating error which will result in machining error of parts. This paper presents a prediction model of a workpiece locating error caused by the setup error and geometric inaccuracy of locaters for the fixtures with one locating surface and two locating pins. Error parameters along {{6 degrees of freedom}} can be calculated by the proposed model and then compensated by either using the “frame transformation” function of a numerical control (NC) system or modifying NC codes in post-processing. In addition, machining error caused by the workpiece locating error can be predicted based on a multi-body system and homogeneous transfer matrix. This is meaningful to fixture design and machining process planning. Finally, a cutting test has shown that the proposed method is practicable and effective...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an enhanced}} method to analytically identify an unknown {{tool centre point}} (TCP) of standard industrial robots with six degrees of freedom. The method uses a mathematical closed form to determine the position and orientation (pose) of a mounted robot <b>tool</b> <b>frame</b> {{in relation to the}} robot flange frame. This unknown pose is represented by a homogeneous transformation that is calculated by performing two robot movements. The position and orientation of the robot is measured after each movement, which leads to an equation of the form, where represents the unknown homogeneous transformation from the robot flange to the TCP. The achievable accuracy in comparison to existing methods is enhanced by using relative movements with orthogonal rotational axes. This ensures optimal error propagation for solving the resulting equation and leads to a very accurate calculation of the unknown transformation. The described method was evaluated and tested on a standard industrial robot. All measurements to determine the position and orientation of the robot tool were done with a laser tracker.
