25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these <b>things</b> <b>better</b> than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E
25|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{that there is a}} third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make <b>things</b> <b>better</b> (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.|$|E
25|$|In Why F A Hayek is a Conservative, British {{policy analyst}} Madsen Pirie claims Hayek {{mistakes}} {{the nature of}} the conservative outlook. Conservatives, he says, are not averse to change – but like Hayek, they are highly averse to change being imposed on the social order by people in authority who think they know how to run <b>things</b> <b>better.</b> They wish to allow the market to function smoothly and give it the freedom to change and develop. It is an outlook, says Pirie, that Hayek and conservatives both share.|$|E

25|$|The {{prisoner}} Emma rescued {{is revealed}} to be none other than Maid Marian, who eagerly runs to embrace Robin Hood and Roland. A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly what her mother did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make <b>things</b> <b>better.</b> Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian had better {{be the only thing}} she brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes her gloves and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading out of the barn, leaving a trail of frozen ground behind her.|$|E

[...] Champion jockey Tony McCoy also defended the National, saying, [...] "I personally don't think the sport could be in any better shape for horses or jockeys." [...] Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: [...] "We're still grieving but I think this whole hyped up situation regarding the Grand National is totally wrong... National Hunt racing is safer and compliant with every single sport that goes along. My son snowboarded in France and, unfortunately, he had an accident and he'll never walk again.

500|$|Development on Mega Man 3 {{began at}} Capcom {{over a year}} after the release of Mega Man 2. Akira Kitamura, the lead {{supervisor}} for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", considered Mega Man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to [...] " [...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game." [...] He had [...] "preset notions" [...] about successful development because of the team's good experience with Mega Man 2 and found that his new superior [...] "didn't really understand Mega Man the way his predecessor did". During the game's production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put Mega Man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready. Inafune concluded, [...] "I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could do a lot of <b>things</b> <b>better,</b> make it a better game, but the company said that we needed to release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} first five games in charge, {{including}} a 7–0 thumping from Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, Gannon {{admitted that the}} club's finances limited his ability to change personnel. He also stated that [...] "if I didn't take the job, this club would've had a real chance of dying... I'm not proud to be {{the manager of a}} club that loses 7–0... but this is my team now... It has always been my club, so it's my responsibility to make <b>things</b> <b>better,</b> and over time we will." [...] He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3–2 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The [...] "Hatters" [...] secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1–1 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return. Stockport finished the campaign in 16th place, 10 points above the drop and 20 points below the play-off zone.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{already noted}} the {{importance}} of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate <b>things</b> <b>better</b> when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen. A team from the University of Adelaide has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in miscarriage or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as TGF-Beta. The team has found that certain men, dubbed [...] "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or miscarriage. Among other things, most of the [...] "dangerous males" [...] seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce immunological tolerance in their partners.|$|E
