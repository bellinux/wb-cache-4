5|$|The {{symbol of}} <b>this</b> <b>free</b> {{association}} is Queen Elizabeth II, {{who serves as}} the Head of the Commonwealth. This position, however, does not imbue her with any political or executive power over any Commonwealth member states; the position is purely symbolic, {{and it is the}} Commonwealth Secretary-General who is {{the chief executive of the}} Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from <b>this</b> <b>free</b> motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In <b>this</b> <b>free</b> base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
50|$|This {{album was}} the first to feature Kenny MacLean as a {{full-time}} bassist and keyboardist. <b>This</b> <b>freed</b> lead singer Mark Holmes to focus on lead vocal duties.|$|R
50|$|Usually only {{a single}} vacuum pump station is {{required}} rather than multiple stations found in gravity and low pressure networks. <b>This</b> <b>frees</b> up land, reduces energy costs and reduces operational costs.|$|R
50|$|On May 13, 1888, Princess Isabel, {{acting in}} place of her ailing father Pedro II, signed the law that {{abolished}} slavery in Brazil, granting no compensation to slave owners. <b>This</b> <b>freed</b> 700,000 slaves.|$|R
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels <b>this</b> <b>free,</b> and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in <b>this</b> <b>free</b> role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E
25|$|Each March since 1970, the {{university}} has hosted the largest pow-wow in Southern California. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> two-day event, which attracts more than 6,000 persons each year, features Native American dancing, arts, craft and native foods.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>free</b> {{software}} {{has been}} incorporated into classroom and lab curricula for synthetic biology, systems biology, bioengineering, and bioinformatics.

50|$|State Route 37, from Petersburg east to Garysville, was renumbered State Route 106. <b>This</b> <b>freed</b> up State Route 37 (now U.S. Route 13) {{to match}} North Carolina Highway 37, {{replacing}} all of State Route 53.|$|R
50|$|With the Netherlands falling, Prussia {{also decided}} to leave the coalition, signing the Peace of Basel on 6 April, ceding {{the west bank of the}} Rhine to France. <b>This</b> <b>freed</b> Prussia to finish the {{occupation}} of Poland.|$|R
50|$|For {{several months}} nothing happened—then came {{the capture of}} Weraroa Pa—the relief of the siege of Pipiriki in August 1865 that {{virtually}} ended that phase of the Second Taranaki War. <b>This</b> <b>freed</b> up the militia for action elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|As her {{applications}} were repeatedly rejected, Ebadi was {{not able}} to practice as a lawyer until 1993, while she already had a law office permit. She used <b>this</b> <b>free</b> time to write books and many articles in Iranian periodicals.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 2016, Hulu {{announced}} that it would end the availability of its free streaming service through its own platform, making it oriented exclusively to subscription services.

View.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{can also}} exert {{neurotoxicity}} through lipid peroxidation, {{as a result}} of its pro-oxidant properties. Quinolinic acid can interact with Fe(II) to form a complex that induces a reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), notably the hydroxyl radical •OH. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> radical causes oxidative stress by further increasing glutamate release and inhibiting its reuptake, and results in the breakdown of DNA in addition to lipid peroxidation.|$|E
50|$|During the Sexual Revolution, the different-sex sexual ideal became {{completely}} {{separated from}} procreation, {{yet at the}} same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed <b>this</b> <b>freeing</b> of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.|$|R
25|$|On 29 August, the Porte {{formally}} {{rejected the}} Treaty of London's stipulations, triggering the dispatch of Allied representatives to Nafplion.

25|$|Thomas Cubitt, a London {{building}} contractor, incorporated simple classical {{lines of}} the Italianate style as defined by Sir Charles Barry into many of his London terraces. Cubitt designed Osborne House {{under the direction of}} Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and it is Cubitt's reworking of his two dimensional street architecture into <b>this</b> <b>free</b> standing mansion which was to be the inspiration for countless Italianate villas throughout the British Empire.|$|E
25|$|From 1961 only Australians had {{unrestricted}} {{entry to}} New Zealand. This was a long-standing right, established in 1840 when New Zealand became a British colony like Australia. Reciprocal travel arrangements, {{beginning in the}} 1920s, formalised <b>this</b> <b>free</b> movement {{from one country to}} the other. In 1973, the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement allowed Australian and New Zealand citizens to enter each other's countries to visit, live, work, or remain indefinitely without having to apply for a permit.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>Free</b> Royal Town status gave a great {{impetus to}} the {{development}} of the city. During the 19th century its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the Habsburg Monarchy. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the Revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy in 1848/49.|$|E

50|$|The only {{possibility}} for new growth/colonization in this successional sequence arises when a disturbance leads to dominating species being destroyed, damaged, or removed. <b>This</b> <b>frees</b> up resources {{and allows for}} the invasion of other species that were not previously present.|$|R
50|$|The aim of Freeze Tag is {{to freeze}} the entire enemy team. Players are frozen instead of killed and {{teammates}} can rescue them by {{standing next to the}} icy body for three seconds. <b>This</b> <b>frees</b> the player to join the battle once more.|$|R
25|$|Holland and Corea left to {{form their}} own group, Circle, active in 1970 and 1971. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> jazz group {{featured}} multi-reed player Anthony Braxton and drummer Barry Altschul. This band was documented on Blue Note and ECM. Aside from soloing in an atonal style, Corea sometimes reached {{in the body of}} the piano and plucked the strings. In 1971 or 1972 Corea struck out on his own. In April 1971 he recorded the sessions that became Piano Improvisations Vol. 1 and Piano Improvisations Vol. 2 for ECM.|$|E
25|$|Churubusco Chamber of Commerce and the Town of Churubusco {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in creating events that have assisted in {{the improvement of the}} quality of life for town residents. Every August, Churubusco hosts the 'Busco Block Party. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> event features local merchants, live music, and other events. The Chamber and the Town have also partnered to organize Halloweenfest. Held the Saturday before Halloween, the event features a merchant trick-or-treat, costume contest, hayrides, and more. Hundreds of children attend the event and it continues to grow every year.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} SafetyLit {{came from an}} {{electronic}} mailing list service provided in the early-1990s by the librarians at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). This bibliographic update was a print-out of article citations from Medline that were indexed with selected MeSH terms related to the treatment and prevention of injuries. <b>This</b> <b>free</b> service was provided {{at a time when}} searching Medline was quite costly. The NCIPC update service ended in 1994, about one year before the National Library of Medicine began providing an experimental version of PubMed.|$|E
50|$|This is an {{instructional}} strategy in which computer-assisted teaching is integrated with classroom instruction.
