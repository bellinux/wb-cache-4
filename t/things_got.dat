5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, <b>things</b> <b>got</b> worse for Maryland as the Cavaliers added {{a field goal}} and another touchdown. In a final drive for 46yards, Maryland {{attempted}} to avert a shutout. The effort fell short when a Turner pass was intercepted. The final result was 31–0.|$|E
5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. <b>Things</b> <b>got</b> progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, the {{architect}} Eliel Saarinen {{was commissioned by}} the AIA of Michigan to compose a waterfront civic center design. However, World War II {{got in the way}} of its development, and it wasn't until the late 1940s that <b>things</b> <b>got</b> under way. The first parts to go up in the area were the buildings, including a veteran's hall, an auditorium, and the city-county building.|$|E

25|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, more B-57Bs were moved from Clark AB to Bien Hoa to make good these losses and to {{reinforce}} the original deployment. The B-57s shared an open-air, three-sided hangar with the Vietnamese Air Force that flew A-1E Skyraider aircraft, and <b>things</b> <b>got</b> so crowded at Bien Hoa {{at that time that}} some of the B-57s had to be sent back to Clark AB. Also, maintenance facilities for the B-57 at Bien Hoa were scarce.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{recovery}} {{and the end}} of petrol rationing led to rapid growth in car ownership and use. Vehicle mileage grew at a sustained annual rate of 10% between 1948 and 1964. In contrast, railway traffic remained steady during the 1950s but the economics steadily deteriorated, with labour costs rising faster than income and fares and freight charges repeatedly frozen by the government to try to control inflation. By 1955 income no longer covered operating costs, and <b>things</b> <b>got</b> steadily worse.|$|E
25|$|Invalidation of the {{referendum}} infuriated Băsescu's opposers that gathered in their thousands {{in front of}} the Bucharest National Theatre. Protesters shouted messages against CCR decision to invalidate {{the referendum}} and asked Traian Băsescu to resign. Likewise, many people have come up with anti-US placards, considering that Băsescu was reinstated at Americans desire. Towards evening <b>things</b> <b>got</b> out of control, people breached fences and entered on the carriageway, blocking traffic. Next day, the Gendarmerie fined or queried 106 people for disturbing public peace and destruction of public domain.|$|E

More protests followed on 26 October calling for, among other things, the firing of SEDUE head Carrillo Arena. <b>Things</b> <b>got</b> worse through February 1986, mostly due to the ineffectiveness of SEDUE and PRHP. Finally Carrillo Arena was fired from SEDUE and replaced by Manuel Camacho Solís.|$|E
25|$|His second spell in London {{was not as}} {{successful}} as his previous one. Now playing in the Second Division, <b>things</b> <b>got</b> worse for both McAvennie and West Ham when the striker suffered a broken leg on the opening {{game of the season}} on 19 August 1989, following a challenge by Stoke City's Chris Kamara, which put him out until March 1990. He made his return on 31 March 1990 against Port Vale. By this time West Ham were 10th in the league and ultimately finished in 7th place missing out on the playoffs.|$|E

In subsequent interviews, Green said he successfully calmed the audience down for ten minutes, but <b>things</b> <b>got</b> worse {{when he left the}} stage. Tequila continued performing for an additional twenty minutes and eventually suffered facial injuries after being struck in the face by a rock.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, the {{allocation}} rules seem important. There is lot of spatial autocorrelation in urban land uses; it’s driven by historical path dependence: {{this sort of}} <b>thing</b> <b>got</b> started here and seeds more of the same.

25|$|The {{following}} season, <b>things</b> <b>got</b> a {{bit better}} for the Cents in the standings. Although they finished last in the Interior Division yet again, they managed to avoid the league basement. Merritt went 26–38–2, ending up well ahead of the last place Nanaimo Clippers. Zelinski continued his torrid scoring pace, finishing fifth in league scoring with 50 goals, 61 assists, and 111 points in 66 games. In the playoffs, Merritt once again locked horns with the Kelowna squad {{in the first round}} and again the Buckaroos proved to be too much, beating the Centennials in seven games.|$|E
25|$|One minute {{into the}} fourth quarter, Septien kicked a 22-yard field goal that {{cut the deficit}} to 21-20. Then Walls {{recovered}} a fumble from running back Walt Easley at midfield to set up White's 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Cosbie, giving Dallas a 27–21 advantage. <b>Things</b> <b>got</b> even better for Dallas when Walls recorded his second interception from Montana on the next drive at the Cowboys 27. Dallas managed {{to pick up a}} few first downs, but was forced to punt, and White's kick gave San Francisco the ball at their own 11 with 4:54 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|In late 1972 Tek {{had joined}} the band TV Jones as lead singer/guitarist along with Chris Jones on guitar, Gerry Jones on drums (brother of the now {{successful}} jazz trumpet player Vince Jones), Giles Vanderwerf on bass. TV Jones had a fanatical cult following in Wollongong, {{to the point where}} <b>things</b> <b>got</b> crazed and dangerous where by in 1974, the group fled north of the city. The band was hopeful of success, but amid disastrous engagements at Chequers and the Whisky A Go Go, ran afoul of both the police and organised crime simultaneously. After unsuccessful album recording sessions in North Sydney, the group began to disintegrate, sacking Tek from TV Jones as a negative influence.|$|E

25|$|The new-look team {{opened their}} season {{with an easy}} 95–65 victory away to London Capital, and {{compiled}} a six-game unbeaten run at home with wins against such teams as the Everton Tigers, Newcastle Eagles and Milton Keynes Lions. However, the team's form on the road left something to be desired and after the opening win against London Capital, the Heat lost their next five games away from Guildford. <b>Things</b> <b>got</b> worse in December, when the Heat lost their 100% home record, losing 83–97 to the table-topping Sheffield Sharks. This {{was the start of}} a six-game losing streak, halted by a New Year's Day win against the Essex Pirates and finally a triumph on the road, a 74–72 win against the Leicester Riders in the BBL Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Landrith made {{immediate}} headlines when he {{was involved}} in a scuffle against the New York Yankees on June 11. Rookie Oriole outfielder Boog Powell was hospitalized after Yankees pitcher Bud Daley beaned Powell {{in the head with a}} pitch in the top of the 4th. In the bottom of the 4th, Baltimore pitcher Robin Roberts immediately threw a fastball over the head of Yankees star Roger Maris. Maris started walking toward the mound, bat in hand. Roberts was afraid that if <b>things</b> <b>got</b> physical he would break his hand. Landrith jumped on Maris' back, clearing the benches. No punches were thrown in the incident, nor were any suspensions or fines levied by American League president Joe Cronin. The Orioles won 5-3.|$|E
25|$|India {{fought back}} at Headingley, winning a rain {{affected}} match on the DL Method. <b>Things</b> <b>got</b> worse for England {{in the following}} match at The Oval. Despite posting an impressive 316/6, led by a century from Owais Shah, a poor bowling performance, combined with an excellent innings of 94 from Sachin Tendulkar, saw India reach their target with just two balls to spare. This levelled the series at 3-3 with one game left to play. The final game saw England clinch a convincing victory after bowling India out for just 187. England never looked like losing, and reached their target in just 36.2 overs, finishing the match on 188/3. The victory saw England clinch the series 4-3, making amends for t he defeat they suffered in the test series.|$|E

25|$|Hebard {{made her}} way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived at the future capital city {{in the company of}} her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became part of the social scene with other young people at the newly {{constructed}} Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if <b>things</b> <b>got</b> out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne telephone pole.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Vikings {{entered a}} {{rebuilding}} year. After the heartbreak of previous seasons many veteran players retired from football leaving the Vikings {{with the task}} of re-inventing themselves. They competed in the newly formed SBC South and finished with a 6–2 record. For the second time in 3 years the Vikings season was hampered by forfeits and teams no fulfilling fixtures. As DCU left the league before the season the south was left with 4 teams. Then <b>things</b> <b>got</b> worse the Cork Admirals folded after just one game leaving the south with 3 teams and none of those teams getting the normal 8 games. The Vikings lost 2 of 3 fixtures with Trinity meaning they would qualify as the second seed in the south. The highlight of the regular season being a 13–12 victory over Trinity in Limerick.|$|E
25|$|Scotland started well in Bridgend with Wade Liddell {{giving the}} Bravehearts the lead after just 8 minutes. This try was {{converted}} by Gareth Morton. But <b>things</b> <b>got</b> bad as Wales pulled a try back through Richard Johnson, and then Danny Brough was sinbinned for dissent on 26 minutes. In {{the next ten}} minutes a Wales team minus Iestyn Harris, who failed a fitness test prior to the match, capitalised on Scotland's shortfall and scored two tries to create a 14–6 lead going into half-time. However, after the break the Scots immediately {{got back into the}} match, Danny Brough singlehandedly scoring a try after 70 seconds of the interval, and Jamie Benn a little later leeching on to a grubber kick. Mick Nanyn missed both conversions and so the scores were tied. On the 67th minute Scotland went in front, Nanyn converting his own try. And to seal a 21–14 victory Danny Brough scored a drop-goal. He would later get Man of the Match award.|$|E
