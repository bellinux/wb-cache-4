500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
2500|$|In the DuckTales series, Scrooge {{has adopted}} the nephews (as Donald {{has joined the}} Navy and is away on his tour of duty), {{and as a result}} his rougher edges are {{smoothed}} out somewhat. While most of his traits remain from the comics, he is notably more jovial and less irritable in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that [...] "for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left Scotland, I have a family". Though Scrooge is far from heartless in the comics, he is rarely so openly sentimental. While he still hunts for treasure in Ducktales, many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also a good-hearted and generous with his family and friends.|$|E
60|$|I started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer's {{question}} reminded me, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{had left}} England, that something HAD happened.|$|E
25|$|Norway {{qualified}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1938, Bolivia for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1950, and Switzerland for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1966.|$|R

60|$|In the morning, when I {{went down}} into the breakfast-room at the usual hour, Miss Halcombe, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had known her, was absent from her {{customary}} place at the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur {{will permit}} me to remark," [...] he whispered, [...] "that this is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{have been in the}} service of Monsieur Feurgéres that anyone has {{occupied}} his private box. I trust that Mademoiselle will be comfortable." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2008 marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> [...] that <b>the</b> top {{seeds from}} both {{conferences}} {{met in the}} Finals and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2003 that any top seeded team played in the NBA finals.

6000|$|... "Good afternoon," [...] {{said the}} Tin Woodman, {{taking off his}} funnel cap and bowing to Dorothy and the Prince. [...] "I think I must have been asleep for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was made of tin, for I do not {{remember}} our leaving the Nome King." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{smoked a}} couple of cigars for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> came from the country; and as Anne and Charles went to the play, I muddled away the evening over my Sheriff-Court processes, and {{despatched}} a hugeous parcel to Will Scott at Selkirk. It is always something off hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{straightened}} {{up and looked at}} me. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> knew her I saw her face--which was the color of the white keys of a new piano--turn pink. I walked toward her without a word. She let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass.|$|E
50|$|The Giants won at AT&T Stadium for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2012 {{and started}} 1-0 for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2010.|$|R

50|$|Next {{week the}} Browns look {{to win in}} Pittsburgh for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2003, and sweep the Steelers for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1988.|$|R
6000|$|... "For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} in the house, my door is locked. I cannot, and will not, see Mrs. Gallilee again. All her former cruelties are, as I feel it, nothing to the cruelty of her coming here when I am ill, and saying to me what she has said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are {{the party}} going to be, Mallett?" [...] his friend Colonel Severn said, {{as they stood}} {{together}} {{on the deck of}} the Osprey early in August.

60|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{had known}} Theodore Watling, however, I {{saw him in}} the shadow of another individual; a man who, like a {{powerful}} magnet, continually drew our glances. When we spoke, we almost invariably addressed him, his rare words fell like bolts upon the consciousness. There was no apparent rift in that personality.|$|E
5000|$|Clare win the Munster {{title for}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1932 championship. They later claim the All-Ireland title for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1914.|$|R

5000|$|... 2008 was {{a disappointing}} year by Xplosion standards; despite {{finishing}} {{with a solid}} 6-2 record, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2005, <b>the</b> Xplosion failed to win the conference title, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2004, failed to win the division title, and for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> becoming a fully licensed team, {{failed to make the}} playoffs.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do {{not take}} your advice it will be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have come to look to you for so much," [...] she went on. [...] "Cannot you suggest {{something}} else? My friends are having such a splendid visit. Helen is getting well. Oh, I should be sorry to see them go before they want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{considerably}} sharper than a serpent's tooth," [...] he said. [...] "You should be fawning gratefully upon me, not laughing. Do you suppose King Charles laughed at my ancestor when he ate the despatches? However, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{have been in}} this house I feel as if I had had a square meal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] Penrose {{answered}} firmly. [...] "In Father Benwell's position {{it might}} have been his doing, but for his goodness to me. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have known him he has shrunk from a responsibility. For my sake he has left it to Rome. And Rome has spoken. Oh, my more than friend--my brother in love--!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “No,” she assented with a weary air, “except {{that you}} might ask {{yourself}} what is the good of tormenting a man of noble feelings, however absurd. His Southern blood makes him very violent sometimes. I fear—” And then {{for the first time}} during this conversation, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left Doña Rita the day before, for the first time I laughed.|$|E
6000|$|Basil's face {{during this}} {{sensible}} speech {{had been growing}} darker and darker {{with a sort of}} desperate sagacity. He was cornered almost for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had known him; and to tell the truth I rather wondered at the almost childish obstinacy which kept him so close to his original prejudice in favour of the wildly questionable lieutenant. At length he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Swords gleamed around me: one, two, three, four, five, six, I counted, {{and stood}} weak and dazed from loss of blood, gazing stupidly {{at the white}} blades. Had I but had my sword I should have laid about me, and gone down beneath their blows as befits a soldier. But the absence of that trusty friend left me limp and helpless--cowed for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had borne arms.|$|E
5000|$|With this loss, South Africa lost {{consecutive}} home Test matches for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2010/11; {{and lost}} four consecutive Test matches for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 2010.|$|R
50|$|This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1984 {{re-election}} of Ronald Reagan that Wisconsin {{voted for}} a Republican, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> 1988 that <b>the</b> Republican nominee won the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as Maine's second congressional district.
