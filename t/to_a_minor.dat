5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the French in the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Belgium came under Dutch rule. The Belgian Revolution, which broke out on 25 August 1830 after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera in Brussels led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, was inspired to some extent by the Brabant Revolution. The day after the revolution broke out, revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by the colours chosen by the Brabant Revolution of 1789. The colours (red, yellow and black) today form the national flag of Belgium. Some historians have also argued that the Vonckists and Statists were the forerunners of the major political factions, the Liberals and the Catholics, which would dominate Belgian politics after independence.|$|E
5|$|Born in Thomaston, Georgia, Holloman {{served in}} World War II before {{starting}} his professional baseball career. From 1946 to 1952, he gradually rose up the minor leagues, {{and got a}} spring training invitation from the Chicago Cubs in 1950. After the 1952 season, he was acquired by the St. Louis Browns, who placed him on the major league roster. He made his debut April 18, and in his first start on May 6, he threw a no-hitter, one of three players {{to do so in}} his first start. Holloman pitched in 22 games that season for the Browns before being sold <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> league team. He spent the rest of 1953 and 1954 in the minors before retiring from the game. After retiring, he ran an advertising agency and worked as a scout before his death in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E

In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Louis Edward Nolan (4 January 1818– 25 October 1854) was a British Army {{officer and}} cavalry tactician {{best known for}} his role and death in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. Born <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> {{diplomatic}} official and his wife, Nolan was educated at the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where he was noted as an enthusiastic horseman and military theorist. After early graduation he was commissioned as a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment, serving in Austria, Hungary and on the Polish frontier, where he again became known for his horsemanship and was promoted to senior lieutenant. Due to the nepotism inherent in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces, Nolan succeeded in transferring to the British Army as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minor</b> insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
