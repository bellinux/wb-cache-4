In addition to high quality requirements and health harmlessness of the product, particularly economic and ecologic aspects in terms of minimal processing have been considered. In the present project, a machine concept for the automatic deboning was developed, which meets the requirements of hygienic design. The demands on sensors for detection of ham properties relevant for automated deboning have been determined by manual cutting of pork ham. Furthermore, the order of cutting steps has been acquired.

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{findings}} from a microscopic {{analysis of the}} white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) integumentary ultrastructure. Skin samples from the cheek, shoulder, flank and rump were taken from a 46 -year-old female southern white rhinoceros and examined using H&E and elastic histological stains. The epidermis was <b>thickest</b> in the <b>flank</b> (1. 003 mm) followed by the rump, cheek and shoulder. The stratum corneum comprised {{more than half the}} epidermal thickness. Numerous melanin granules were found in the basal and spinosum layers. The epidermal-dermal junction was characterized by abundant papillary folds increasing surface contact between integument layers. Most of the dermal thickness consisted of organized collagen bundles with scattered elastic fibers. Collagen fiber bundles were <b>thickest</b> in the <b>flank</b> (210. 9 μm) followed by shoulder, rump and cheek. Simple coiled sweat glands were present in the dermis, but hair and sebaceous glands were absent. Together, these data suggest the white rhinoceros has a unique integumentary system among large terrestrial herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Uzice beef prshuta is a {{traditional}} dry meat product, produced from the most valuable cuts of beef from well-fed 3 – 5 yr old cattle: round muscles (rump, <b>thick</b> <b>flank,</b> eye of round, silverside without eye of round, topside), loin muscles (striploin) and tenderloin (fillet). It is a Protected Designation of Origin product, produced in the Zlatibor mountain region of Serbia. In this study, carcass yields of muscles (meat) used for Uzice beef prshuta production were investigated. Cattle carcasses (20 sides) from adult domestic spotted Simmental cattle (n = 10) were examined. Slaughtering and primary processing, cooling, cutting and deboning of the beef carcasses were carried out in production facilites in the Zlatibor mountains. Live wt., wt. of warm and chilled carcasses, wt. of fore and hind quarters, and wt. of various cuts of meat were determined. Yields of single cuts as parts of chilled carcass, hind quarters, round muscles and loin were calculated. Average yields for Uzice beef prshuta production {{as a proportion of}} chilled carcass, hind quarters, round muscles and loin were 16. 83, 35. 83, 46. 0 and 32. 46 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ebb-tidal deltas {{can form}} {{extensive}} strandline sand deposits on barrier-island shorelines. This paper describes the diagnostic textures, sedimentary structures, and geometry of an ebb-tidal delta in a mesotidal setting at North Edisto Inlet, South Carolina. Bedforms and surface textures at North Edisto Inlet reflect ypical ebb-tidal delta circulation patterns. The main ebb channel {{is dominated by}} large ebb-oriented bedforms, and channel sediments become finer grained in the seaward irection. At the inlet throat, the coarsest available sediment forms a lag deposit. Marginal flood channels adjacent to the barrier islands are dominated by flood-oriented bedforms composed of medium-grained sand. Channel-margin l ear bars, flanked by bedforms with opposing orientations, develop where flood channels approach the main ebb channel. The extensive swash platform is dominated by wave energy, which effectively sorts swash platform sediments. Ebb-tidal delta stratigraphy is dominated by sequences deposited by shifting tidal channels and by the migration of swash bars on the swash platform. Proximally, the ebb-tidal delta sequence is dominated by relatively thick tidal-channel deposits which fine upward and have a sharp, disconformable ower contact. Main ebb-channel deposits up to 20 m <b>thick</b> <b>flank</b> the active channel. These deposits are composed primarily of well-sorted, planar-bedded, fine-grained sand. Flaser-bedded sands directly overlie medium to coarse-grained, seaward-directed, crossbedded sands {{at the base of}} the sequence. Adjacent to barrier islands, marginal flood-channel deposits dominate the ebb-tidal delta sequence. These are composed o...|$|E
40|$|This study aimed towards {{comparison}} of carcass characteristics, wholesale cuts yield, body components and meat chemical composition {{and quality of}} two sub-types of Baggara cattle namely Nyalawi and Rizagi. Eighteen animals comprising nine from each type were used. These animals were of similar nutritional background, age and sex. No {{significant differences between the}} two types in carcass yield and other characteristics as dressing percentage were found. Nyalawi cattle sub-type produced heavier or significantly heavier wholesale cuts as <b>thick</b> <b>flank,</b> thick ribs, chuck and brisket. Carcass composition indicated that the fat and bone percentages were greater in Nyalawi cattle carcasses, however muscle: bone and muscle: fat ratios were greater in Rizagi cattle carcasses. Body components revealed that Nyalawi cattle sub-type had heavier rumen, reticulum and omasum while omental fat and reproductive organs were heavier in Rizagi cattle. Other body components were almost similar in the two types of cattle. Meat chemical composition indicated significantly high (P< 0. 01) protein and sarcoplasmic proteins and non protein nitrogen in Nyalawi cattle type. Meat colour readings gave significantly (P< 0. 01) high lightness (L) in meat from Rizagi cattle, while it was significantly high (P< 0. 001) redness values (a) were found in Nyalawi cattle meat. No significant differences were found between the two cattle sub types in subjective meat quality evaluation yet Rizagi cattle meat was rated x higher in overall acceptability than Nyalawi cattle meat. No {{significant differences between the two}} cattle types in carcass measurements were found but Nyalawi cattle type tended to have longer carcasses and legs, larger L. dorsi area and barrel circumference.

5000|$|Ballymote castle {{is a large}} {{enclosure}} castle, the most symmetrical of all the Irish [...] "keepless" [...] castles. It has many similarities with Beaumaris Castle, in Anglesey, Wales, built by King Edward I of England. The entrance, with a double towered gate, is in the north wall and had twin D-shaped towers. It has a gatehouse typical of the period, the outer portions of which have almost completely disappeared. The castle, however, remains an impressive structure. The interior measures about 30 m2. There are three-quarter round towers at all four corners {{and also in the}} middle of the east and west walls. [...] A postern gate, which was planned for the centre of the south wall, was never completed, probably because of the events of 1317, when the castle was lost to the O'Connors. A small square tower had protected this gate. [...] The walls are about 10 ft <b>thick</b> and <b>flanked</b> with six noble towers. Passages of about 3 ft wide ran through the centre of the walls all around and the passages were built in such a way that they gave access to the towers, and to the intervening curtain walls at different heights, thereby meeting the needs of attack or defence.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{chemical}} changes and mass transfer {{in the formation}} of granular fault cores across carbonate strata is still unclear. Thirteen granular fault cores across strata of dolostone from Sperlonga, central Italy, are analyzed by chemical and physical methods. The analyzed faults are reverse or transpressional, up to about 1 m <b>thick,</b> and <b>flanked</b> by a host rock affected by a widely developed solution cleavage. Grain size distributions of fault core rocks are determined by a sieving procedure for grains larger than 63 mm. Mechanisms of grain comminution are inferred by microscopic analyses on a set of thin sections obtained from epoxy-impregnated fault rock samples. Concentrations of calcium and magnesium in the fault cores and in the adjacent host rock are determined by titrimetry. Results show that both the breccia and the gouge forming the fault cores show little evidence for mass transfer, regardless of the fault type and grain size distribution of fault rocks. We interpret these results as chiefly the effect, within the fault core, of a strongly reduced permeability, which impeded significant mass transfer processes through solute transport. It follows that grain comminution occurred mostly by brittle processes such as crushing and abrasive wear. Previous work suggests that these results are rather generalizable; some exceptions, however, compel further research on the role of circulating fluids and mass transfer {{in the formation of}} carbonate fault rock...|$|R

Film breakup appeared to initiate at either niobium grain boundary ridges, or at asperities or irregularities on the niobium surface that caused localized contact with the sapphire...|$|R
40|$|Thick pumice {{deposits}} {{were found}} in the cored sequences of forearc, arc, and backarc sites of Leg 126 in the Izu-Bonin Arc. These deposits, composed of fragmental rhyolite pumice with the chemical composition of low-alkali tholeiites, are products of arc volcanism. Pumice deposits constitute {{more than half of the}} thickness of the sediment fill of the Sumisu Rift, a backarc rift of the Izu-Bonin Arc. They comprise five thick pumiceous beds separated by thin hemipelagic units; as such, they record four major episodes or pulses of explosive, rhyolitic volcanism during the last 0. 15 Ma, separated by quiescent intervals that each lasted about 30 - 60 k. y. The thick pumiceous beds were deposited in the rift mainly by sediment gravity flows during and immediately after the eruption of arc volcanos, which were probably submarine. Initiation of rifting was also preceded in the Pliocene by submarine rhyolitic volcanism, as seen in samples from the top of the eastern rift <b>flank.</b> <b>Thick</b> pumice beds correlative with those in the backarc also occur in the forearc basin to the east...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{surface erosion}} by {{wildfire}} is significant and widespread {{but has not}} been quantified in southern California or for chaparral ecosystems. Quantifying the surface erosion of bedrock outcrops and boulders is critical for determination of age using cosmogenic radionuclide techniques, as even modest surface erosion removes the accumulation of the cosmogenic radionuclides and causes significant underestimate of age. This study documents the effects on three large granitic boulders following the Esperanza Fire of 2006 in southern California. Spalled rock fragments were quantified by measuring the removed rock volume from each measured boulder. Between 7 % and 55 % of the total surface area of the boulders spalled in this single fire. The volume of spalled material, when normalized across the entire surface area, represents a mean surface lowering of 0. 7 – 12. 3 mm. Spalled material was <b>thicker</b> on the <b>flanks</b> of the boulders, and {{the height of the}} fire effects significantly exceeded the height of the vegetation prior to the wildfire. Surface erosion of boulders and bedrock outcrops as a result of wildfire spalling results in fresh surfaces that appear unaffected by chemical weathering. Such surfaces may be preferentially selected by researchers for cosmogenic surface dating because of their fresh appearance, leading to an underestimate of age...|$|R

40|$|Highlights • Magmatic chlorine-excess is {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} tracer of hydrothermal contamination. • Red Sea magmas show Cl-excess more extreme than even fast spreading ridges. • High-Cl Red Sea environment produces high-Cl hydrothermally altered crust and magmatic Cl-excess. • (Ultra) slow-spreading ridge magmas can assimilate hydrothermally altered crust. • Magmatic Cl-excess can guide hydrothermal prospection in the Red Sea. Abstract Newly formed oceanic crust is initially cooled by circulating seawater, although where this occurs and over what regions fluids enter the crust is still unclear. Differences in the chlorine (Cl) concentrations between mid-ocean ridge basalt and seawater potentially make Cl a sensitive tracer for this hydrothermal circulation, allowing assimilation of hydrothermal fluids or hydrothermally altered crust by rising magma to be traced by measuring excess Cl in erupted lavas. Such excess Cl {{has been found in}} basalts from fast-spreading ridges (Cl concentrations up to 1200 ppm), but not so far on ultraslow- and slow-spreading ridges, where lower Cl values in the basalts (50 – 200 ppm) make variations harder to measure. The Red Sea, with its relatively saline bottom water (40 – 42 ‰, cf. 35 ‰ salinity in open ocean water), the presence of axial brine pools (up to 270 ‰ salinity) and <b>thick</b> evaporite sequences <b>flanking</b> the young rift provides an ideal opportunity to study the incorporation of hydrothermal Cl at an ultraslow- to slow-spreading ridge (max. 1. 6 cm/yr). Both absolute Cl concentrations (up to 1300 ppm) and ratios of Cl to elements of similar mantle incompatibility (e. g. K, Nb) are much higher in Red Sea basalts than for average ultraslow- and slow-spreading ridges. An origin of these Cl-excesses by seafloor weathering or syn-eruptive contamination can be excluded, as can mineral/melt fractionation during melting or crystallisation, based on trace element data. Instead, the incorporation of Cl at depth derived from hydrothermal circulation either by direct assimilation of hydrothermal fluids or through mixing of magma with partial melts of the hydrothermally altered crust is indicated. We see no influence of local spreading rate, the intensity of seafloor fracturing or the calculated depth of last crystal fractionation on Cl-excess. Seafloor areas with clear evidence of present or recent hydrothermal activity (brine pool temperatures above ambient, presence of hydrothermal sediments) always show Cl-excess in the local basalts and there is a positive correlation between Cl-excess and intensity of local volcanism (as determined by the percentage of local seafloor showing volcanic bathymetric forms). From this we conclude that Cl-excess in basalts is related to high crustal temperatures and hydrothermal circulation and so can be used to prospect for active or recently extinct hydrothermal systems. Samples recovered within 5 km of a seafloor evaporite outcrop show particularly high Cl-excesses, suggesting addition of Cl from the evaporites to the inflow fluids and that this may be the length scale over which hydrothermal recharge occurs...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no escape}} {{from one of}} these two alternatives. Now the {{objections}} to the notion of the sea having gone up are very considerable indeed; for you will readily perceive that the sea could not possibly have risen a thousand feet in the Pacific without rising pretty much the same distance everywhere else; and if it had risen that height everywhere else since the reefs began to be formed, the geography of the world in general must have been very different indeed, at that time, from what it is now. And we have very good means of knowing that any such rise as this certainly has not taken place in the level of the sea since the time that the corals have been building their houses. And so the only other alternative was to suppose that the land had gone down, and at so slow a rate that the corals were able to grow upward as fast as it went downward. You will see at once that this is the solution of the mystery, and nothing can be simpler or more obvious when you come to think about it. Suppose we start with a coral sea and put {{in the middle of it}} an island such as the Mauritius. Now let the coral polypes come and perch on the shore and build a fringing reef, which will stop when they come to 20 or 25 fathoms, and you will have a fringing reef like that round the island in the illustration. So long as the land remains stationary, so long as it does not descend so long will that reef be unable to get any further out, because the moment the polype embryos try to get below they die. But now suppose that the land sinks very gradually indeed. Let it subside by slow degrees, until the mountain peak, which we have in the middle of it, alone projects beyond the sea level. The fringing reef would be carried down also; but we suppose that the sinking is so slow that the coral polypes are able to grow up as fast as the land is carried down; consequently they will add layer upon layer until they form a deep cup, because the inner part of the reef grows much more slowly than the outer part. Thus you have the reef forming a bed <b>thicker</b> upon the <b>flanks</b> of the island; but the edge of the reef will be very much further out from the land, and the lagoon will be many times deeper; in short, your fringing reef will be converted into an encircling reef. And if, instead of this being an island, it were a great continent like Australia, then you will have the phenomenon of a barrier reef which I have described. The barrier reef of Australia was originally a fringing reef; the land has gone slowly down; the consequence is the lagoon has deepened until its depth is now 25 fathoms and the corals have grown up at the outer edge until you have that prodigious accumulation which forms the barrier reef at present. Now let this process go on further still; let us take the land a further step down, so as to submerge even the peak. The coral, still growing up, will cover the surface of the land, and you will have an atoll reef; that is to say, a more or less circular or oval ring of coral rock with a lagoon in the middle. Thus you see that every peculiarity and phenomenon of these different forms of coral reef was explained at once by the simplest of all possible suppositions, namely, by supposing that the land has gone down at a rate not greater than that at which the coral polypes have grown up. You explain a Fringing Reef as a reef which is formed round land comparatively stationary; an Encircling Reef as one which is formed round land going down; and an Atoll as a reef formed upon land gone down; and the thing is so simple that a child may understand it when it is once explained.|$|R
