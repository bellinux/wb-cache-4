500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the first in which Coulthard was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was optimistic for the new season, saying: [...] "If they need an opinion then they have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> this year. In the past they didn't. But that said, it's important for me not to get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past. We just have to go forward." [...] He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps. Two weeks later in the Brazilian Grand Prix, Coulthard secured his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco.|$|E

It is useless your {{saying that there is}} no one else. You know very well that the authorities, some of them--the chaplain--would go and see Mrs. Hasketh for you. He could have a great deal more influence with her than any one else could, if he felt like saying a good word for you. As far as I am concerned, you have expiated your offence fully; but I should think you yourself would see that you ought not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with this request; or you ought <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> last of all men." ...|$|E
