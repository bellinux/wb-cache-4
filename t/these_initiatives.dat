5|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{hundreds of thousands of}} Poles concealed and aided hundreds of thousands of their Polish-Jewish neighbors. Many of <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> were carried out by individuals, but there also existed organized networks of Polish resistance which were dedicated to aiding Jews– most notably, the Żegota organization.|$|E

Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E

The signature initiative was supported by former chair of the KDU-ČSL Jan Kasal, regional chairman TOP 09, Jiři Blazek and the Regional Councillor, Tomáš Škaryd (ČSSD). However the Roman Catholic parish in Jihlava, distanced itself from the suggestion and dubbed <b>these</b> <b>initiative</b> rather ridiculous.|$|R

5|$|The Empire of Nicaea, {{founded by}} the Laskarid dynasty, managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a {{short-lived}} revival of Byzantine fortunes under Michael VIII Palaiologos, but the war-ravaged Empire was ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} enemies that now surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment. Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade, but none of <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|As Ada reached North Queensland, the BoM issued cyclone {{warnings}} on {{a three-hour}} cycle, with more frequent bulletins occasionally released as needed. Flood warnings were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the Pioneer and Connors. The bureau's post-storm {{assessment of the}} disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all, and public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message {{that there was no}} cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size. Due to the unusual nature of the storm, including its delayed arrival in some areas, many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts. Additionally, many tourists in the region were unfamiliar with the dangers of tropical cyclones. Findings from studies of the public response to Ada were used as the basis for upgraded warning systems and the introduction of more cyclone education campaigns; <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as Cyclone Althea in December 1971.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Rio Branco {{became the}} President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) {{for the first}} time. He would become the Council's longest-serving president, and his cabinet the second longest, in Brazilian history. His {{government}} was marked by a time of economic prosperity and the enactment of several necessary reforms—though they proved to be seriously flawed. The most important of <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> was the Law of Free Birth, which granted freeborn status to children born to slave women. Rio Branco led the government that enacted this law, and its passage increased his popularity. However, his government was plagued by a long crisis with the Catholic Church that had resulted from the expulsion of Freemasons from its lay brotherhoods. After {{more than four years}} heading the Cabinet, Rio Branco resigned in 1875. Following a long vacation in Europe, his health swiftly declined and he was diagnosed with oral cancer. Rio Branco died in 1880 and was widely mourned throughout the country. He is regarded by most historians as one of Brazil's greatest statesmen.|$|E

5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but <b>these</b> <b>initiatives</b> were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} a learner-centered {{model for}} the teaching of elementary mathematics established at an urban Georgia school that serves a highly mobile, diverse population of approximately 475 students. The school was on its state's list of schools needing improvement because students continued to perform poorly on standardized tests. Math Island, a support center for students designed to facilitate the conceptual understanding of mathematics, was created, and professional development programs were implemented to assist teachers in developing their pedagogical and content expertise {{in the teaching of}} mathematics.
