5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. <b>The</b> <b>opinions</b> expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks.

Once <b>the</b> draft <b>opinion</b> has been reviewed, the remaining Justices may recommend changes to <b>the</b> <b>opinion.</b> Whether these changes are accommodated depends on the legal philosophy of the drafters as well as on how strong a majority <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> garnered at conference.

30|$|In {{the work}} of Liu [13], an opinion is a quintuple o=〈e,a,s,h,t〉, where e is the target entity, a is the target aspect of entity e on which <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> has been given, s is the {{sentiment}} polarity of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> towards aspect a of entity e, h is <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> holder, and t is <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> posting time. In our work we adapt this definition to the problem setting we address. We are given a product p {{and a set of}} reviews Rp written about p. Typically, Rp is the set of reviews extracted from a landing page about p in an e-commerce site. Thus, the target entity e is assumed to always be p and we decide to omit this element from <b>the</b> representation of <b>opinions.</b> Furthermore, due to its informative nature, we opt to include the sentiment words in <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> representation. Hence, from this point on, opinions are represented by a quintuple o=〈a,w,s,h,t〉, where a, s, h, and t are the same as above, and w corresponds to the sentiment words of <b>the</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|R
30|$|Opinion {{source or}} holder {{is the person}} or the source who {{presents}} <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> (Liu 2010). <b>The</b> <b>opinion</b> source is important when authenticating <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> {{as well as the}} strength, application and classification of <b>the</b> <b>opinion,</b> as <b>the</b> quality and reliability of an opinion is greatly dependent on the source of that <b>opinion.</b> <b>The</b> <b>opinion</b> topic or <b>the</b> target refers to the person, object, feature, event or topic about which <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> is expressed. To compare or summarize the comments, it is necessary to automatically identify and extract those topics that are discussed in the feedback. To identify topics at the sentence or document level, the system should be able to identify evaluative expressions (Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Hu and Liu 2004). Moreover, some topics are not explicitly presented, but rather, they are predicted from term semantics, also referred to as implicit features. A background study reveals that <b>the</b> process of <b>opinion</b> topic or target extraction involves various natural language processing tasks and techniques such as pre-processing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, noise removal, feature selection and classification.|$|R

5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants.

The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E

5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi {{wanted to}} work with Miike and agreed to the role.

Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested in meeting the director.

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from <b>the</b> <b>opinions</b> espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice.

Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E

5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, <b>the</b> <b>opinions</b> are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).
