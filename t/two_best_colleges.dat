5000|$|To {{return the}} Leopards to the spotlight, Lafayette called on Ernie Nevers, an {{assistant}} coach at Stanford University who helped lead the Indians to three straight Rose Bowl games. Nevers, along with Jim Thorpe, {{was considered one of}} the <b>two</b> <b>best</b> <b>college</b> football players ever and had a legendary career in the early NFL. Hope was high on College Hill as the 1935 freshman team went undefeated against the leading freshmen teams of the East, including Princeton. [...] However, with a young team plagued by injuries, the Leopards went 1-8, their worst record since their first season of football in 1882, and were blown out in their last five games. Despite stating he would stay for the 1937 season, Nevers resigned to become {{an assistant coach}} at the University of Iowa.|$|R

50|$|Many sports tournaments do {{not have}} a third place playoff, mostly {{due to a lack of}} {{interest}} from the competitors and also from the fans. Two of the most celebrated knockout tournaments — the FA Cup Third-fourth place matches (1970-1974) and the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship (1946-1981) — did feature the third place game for a period of time, but later abandoned it. For most of its years, the NCAA consolation game held interest because it usually featured two nationally ranked teams in which only a few teams qualified for the tournament. However, as the field expanded beyond 32 teams, the game lost significance. In addition, eliminating the game allowed the losing teams to return home rather than remaining in the Final Four city for an additional two days to play a game many believed was irrelevant. Relevancy aside, others supported the game for competitive reasons because it typically featured a match between <b>two</b> of the <b>best</b> <b>college</b> teams in the nation; and, it allowed each of those teams to be honored as a Final Four team for the entire weekend.|$|R
