5|$|Budapest Tales {{was even}} less {{successful}} than 25 Fireman Street {{at the box}} office and festivals. According to author David Paul, this may explain why Szabó shifted gears even more dramatically in his next film, Confidence (1980), in which historical events are represented straightforwardly, and are filtered through neither memory nor allegory. The film focuses on <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> man and woman who are forced to share a room as they hide from the Arrow Cross {{toward the end of the}} Second World War. It garnered a Best Director award for Szabó at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 53rd Academy Awards.|$|E

The film opened to Indian audiences on 9 August 2006. On its way to winning state honors and rave reviews, the film {{went on to win}} the South Filmfare Awards among other prominent awards. The film's success broke several records at the box office during its prime and is one of the highest grossing Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with a consideration of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E

5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E
