Their forces stormed Khánh's [...] office and arrested his duty officers but could not find him. There was then a lull in the power struggle. One Vietnamese official said that [...] "All these preparations {{are the result of}} a big misunderstanding on both sides. I don't <b>think</b> <b>either</b> group will start [...] anything, but both think the other will." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even [...] "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer". In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to [...] "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating [...] "satyriasis". Bond also stated that [...] "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not <b>think</b> <b>either</b> hypothesis is likely".|$|E
500|$|Phát and Đức {{could not}} {{apprehend}} Khánh, who had escaped {{the capital and}} flown to the Central Highlands resort town of Da Lat. Their forces stormed Khánh's office and captured his duty officers but {{could not find the}} junta leader. There was then a lull in the movement of troops and units. One Vietnamese public servant said that [...] "All these preparations are the result of a big misunderstanding on both sides. I don't <b>think</b> <b>either</b> group will start anything, but both think the other will." [...] Taylor was on an emergency flight from Honolulu—where he had been in meetings with senior American military figures—back to Saigon and he said the coup [...] "certainly was unannounced and unheralded." [...] In the mid-afternoon Khánh made a radio broadcast on a loyalist system, condemning the coup and calling on the military to remain loyal, claiming that support for the [...] "rebellious leaders" [...] would play {{into the hands of the}} Viet Cong.|$|E

500|$|Before the film's release, {{executive}} producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs stated [...] "If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75million {{at the box}} office, we'll [...] both break even. If it gets $100million, we'll both make money. But if it's a real blockbuster and earns $200million or so at the box office, we'll make good money, and Disney will {{make a lot of}} money." [...] Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350million worldwide. Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>either</b> side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, we never thought their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it." [...] The film's first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend) earned it $39,071,176. The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $29,140,617 and maintained the [...] 1 position at the domestic box office for the next two weekends. Toy Story became the highest-grossing domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, and GoldenEye. At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing animated film of all time, after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992). When not considering inflation, Toy Story is [...] 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time. The film had gross receipts of $191,796,233 in the U.S. and Canada and $181,757,800 in international markets for a total of $373,554,033 worldwide. At the time of its release, the film ranked as 17th highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically and it was the 21st highest-grossing film worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Griswold {{once said}} that she created poems [...] "with almost the fluency of conversation". Poe, {{in a review of}} her work, wrote that she was [...] "absolutely without rival, we <b>think,</b> <b>either</b> in our own country or in England". He {{reviewed}} her poetry collection A Wreath of Flowers from New England in the September 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, saying that its author exhibits [...] "deep feeling and exquisite taste" [...] and her work deserved wider circulation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Churchill written that night, Robert Boothby {{asserted}} that parliamentary opinion was hardening against Halifax, claiming in a postscript that according to Clement Davies, [...] "Attlee & Greenwood are unable {{to distinguish between the}} PM & Halifax and are not prepared to serve under the latter." [...] Davies (who thought Chamberlain should go, and be replaced by Churchill) had lunched with Attlee and Greenwood (and argued his case) shortly before they saw Chamberlain. However, Hugh Dalton noted in his diary entry for 9 May that he had talked to Attlee, who [...] "agrees with my preference for Halifax over Churchill, but we both <b>think</b> <b>either</b> would be tolerable." ...|$|E

Because many {{baseball}} stars had not yet returned from the military, some baseball scholars have deemed the '45 Series to be among the worst-played contests in Series history. For example, prior to the Series, Chicago sportswriter Warren Brown was asked who he liked, and he answered, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>either</b> one of them can win it!" [...] But the Cubs had no answer to Greenberg, who hit the Tigers' only two home runs of the Series and drove in seven, and the Series went Detroit's way.|$|E

More fool I to care what he <b>thinks</b> <b>either!</b> I wish I were dead. If 'twasn't for the child, I'd go and drown myself at that black spring-hole down there--I'd be well out of the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember me to Mr. Strong," [...] {{said the}} widow, as we boarded the train. [...] "Tell him I don't believe he's guilty, and perhaps {{other people in}} Darbyville won't <b>think</b> so <b>either</b> before long." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{should be}} grieved to <b>think</b> that <b>either</b> Ethelbertha or Mrs. Harris belonged to that class of wife, {{but it is}} as well not to overdo [...] "business"--it should be kept for cases of real emergency.|$|R
