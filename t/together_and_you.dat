500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> get a very generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty.

2500|$|PC Zones Paul Mallinson scored it 8.5 out of 10. He {{praised the}} {{improved}} controls, and the enhancements {{made to the}} game engine, concluding [...] "If you liked the original Myth, you'll love this.

There's a fine single-player game to get your teeth into, and an easily workable multiplayer alternative to back it up. There's even a campaign editor which enables you {{to make your own}} missions.
