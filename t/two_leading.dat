5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the <b>two</b> <b>leading</b> candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E
