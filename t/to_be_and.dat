5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned.

Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the origin of birds that showed them to be closely related to coelurosaurian dinosaurs, reappraisal of dinosaur physiology that suggested they weren't the sluggish cold-blooded animals they'd long been assumed <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> a recognition that dinosaurs formed a natural group.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them.

It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation.

5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E

5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids presented it <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E

It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
