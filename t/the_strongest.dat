5|$|Off-season {{cyclones}} {{are most}} likely to occur in the central to western Atlantic Ocean, and most do not make landfall. Of the storms that did strike land, most affected areas surrounding the Caribbean Sea. Cumulatively, at least 398deaths occurred due to the storms, primarily on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba; a tropical storm in May 1948 struck the Dominican Republic to become the deadliest off-season storm. However, an unofficial hurricane in 1863 killed 110people, in a shipwreck off Florida and on land. The same storm was estimated to have reached winds of 105mph (165km/h), making it <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> hurricane between December to May; <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> currently in the official database was a March hurricane in 1908 that reached winds of 100mph (160km/h).

Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal {{as one of the}} ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones. Presently, Hurricane Wilma is <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) in October2005; this also made Wilma <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific, where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures. However, this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific, which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar. Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert, which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17years. The 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with a pressure of 892 mbar (hPa; 26.34 inHg), is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950.
