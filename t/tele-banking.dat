40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} customer {{perceptions of the}} concept of CRM and its relevance to customer satisfaction and loyalty in the UK retail banking industry. It also seeks to identify the critical factors that can impact on a consumer’s choice of bank. The main research instrument is a questionnaire. 240 questionnaires are randomly distributed. Two statistical modelling techniques namely multiple regression and multinomial regression are used to determine characteristics of customers ’ satisfaction and loyalty and to identify key factors in managing customer relationships. Our findings indicate that, in order of priority, the three primary factors that significantly affect customer loyalty are the opportunity to evaluate service offerings; IT and <b>Tele-banking</b> services and opening and closing hours. Participants identified eight significant factors that affect their satisfaction. The three primary factors, in order of priority, are overall satisfaction; the speed of service and IT and <b>Tele-banking</b> services. The most influential factors in choosing a bank, in order of importance, are a bank’s opening and closing times; IT and <b>Tele-banking</b> services; account and transaction accuracy; customer loyalty and overall satisfaction. In conclusion...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel person {{verification}} system for real-time face identification. The main {{features of the}} system include accurate registration of face images using a robust form of correlation, a framework for global registration of a face database using a minimum spanning tree algorithm and a method for selecting a subset of features optimal for discrimination between clients and impostors. The {{results indicate that the}} image registration is of high accuracy and the feature selection is successfully improving on the verification performance. 1 Introduction Verification of person identity based on biometric information is important for many security applications. Examples include access control to buildings, surveillance and intrusion detection. Furthermore, there are many emerging fields that would benefit from developments in person verification technology such as advanced human-computer interfaces and tele-services including tele-shopping and <b>tele-banking.</b> Comparing verific [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the variety}} of applications, {{especially}} distributed multimedia applications, explodes, their requirements on communication -relevant tasks increase. Besides a communication architecture for dealing with traditional communication protocol processing, multicast features and security requirements {{have to be considered}} in an integrated manner. Therefore, a multicast-capable and security-aware communication subsystem is developed to provide necessary functionality to support an integrated set of reuseable application elements, e. g., audio/video-presentation, application sharing, picture phone, extended WWW browser, <b>tele-banking,</b> or tele-seminar. The main goal includes the provision of a real-world application framework, where different traditional and emerging applications can be managed modularily. Their needs and communication demands in terms of Quality-of-Service (QoS) attributes are specified by numerical values, e. g., bandwidth requirements, delay boundaries, reliability issues. Furthermore, functional features, such as multicast groups, encryption desires, or authentication requests can be selected. In turn, the developed communication subsystem allows for the preparation of flexibly adjusted communication protocols that provide requested functionality, e. g., error control schemes, multicast addressing, encryption, or authentication. Finally, a best suited service for these application requests is offered...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examined}} {{electronic payment}} systems and <b>tele-banking</b> services in Nigeria. Thirty {{six out of}} the 89 banks in Nigeria as {{at the end of}} 2005 were selected for the study. Questionnaire method was used to gather data from bank workers. Findings revealed {{that there has been a}} very modest move away from cash. Some payments are now being automated and absolute volumes of cash transactions have declined. Connectivity via the use of Local Area Network (LAN) and wide area network has facilitated electronic transfer of funds. Thirty five out of the 36 banks studied have fully networked their systems to ease communication of account information. The use of Smart Cards, Point of Sales System and Computerized Credit Ratings were not very popular as less than half of the studied banks had fully adopted them. The least fully adopted technologies were ATM, Electronic Home and Office Banking and Telephone Banking. Low rate of adoption of these technologies might be due to low level of economic development, ineffectiveness of NITEL, epileptic supply of power, high cost, fear of fraudulent practices and lack of facilities necessary for their operation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the usability {{testing of the}} Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) and some Interactive TV applications developed by Telefónica I+D for the Spanish satellite-TV operator Vía Digital. Fifty six people participated in the tests. In {{order to have a}} representative sample of the general population, participants were sampled following sex and age quotas from a total of 346 people randomly contacted by telephone. The paper also presents the results of the small telephone survey about TV viewing habits and the opinions about the advances in TV technology. The environment where the trials were made was a domestic setting, and people were asked to use a real working prototype, and to perform typical user tasks, as, e. g., searching for a particular program in the EPG. After each trial, the experimenter took note of the problems faced by the user, and whether the task was successfully completed, and then asked the subject to fill a short questionnaire about the usability of that particular application, including questions about difficulty, presentation speed and aesthetic appearance. At the end of the tests, subjects were also briefly interviewed to obtain the global opinion about the system, and including questions about some marketing issues of digital TV applications. Detailed results about the usability of the Programming Grid, and of the Theme and Channel Search functions are provided. After these results, design guidelines and user interface alternatives were produced, especially for the Programming Grid, which was considered by most subjects {{the most difficult part of}} the EPG. Two interactive TV applications, <b>Tele-banking</b> and Weather Channel, were also tested. These applications presented different difficulty levels for the users, and in particular, the two user interface approaches of the two interactive TV applications produced important differences in the usability of the system...|$|E
