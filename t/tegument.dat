25|$|Animal herpes viruses {{all share}} some common properties. The {{structure}} of herpes viruses {{consists of a}} relatively large double-stranded, linear DNA genome encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid, which is wrapped in a lipid bilayer called the envelope. The envelope is joined to the capsid {{by means of a}} <b>tegument.</b> This complete particle is known as the virion. HSV-1 and HSV-2 each contain at least 74 genes (or open reading frames, ORFs) within their genomes, although speculation over gene crowding allows as many as 84 unique protein coding genes by 94 putative ORFs. These genes encode a variety of proteins involved in forming the capsid, <b>tegument</b> and envelope of the virus, as well as controlling the replication and infectivity of the virus. These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.|$|E
25|$|Springtails {{are well}} known as pests of some {{agricultural}} crops. Sminthurus viridis, the lucerne flea, {{has been shown to}} cause severe damage to agricultural crops, and is considered as a pest in Australia. Onychiuridae are also known to feed on tubers and to damage them to some extent. However, by their capacity to carry spores of mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhiza-helper bacteria on their <b>tegument,</b> soil springtails play a positive role in the establishment of plant-fungal symbioses and thus are beneficial to agriculture. They also contribute to controlling plant fungal diseases through their active consumption of mycelia and spores of damping-off and pathogenic fungi. It has been suggested that they could be reared to be used for the control of pathogenic fungi in greenhouses and other indoor cultures.|$|E
25|$|Fascioloides magna, {{also known}} as giant liver fluke, large American liver fluke or deer fluke, is {{trematode}} parasite that occurs in wild and domestic ruminants in North America and Europe. Adult flukes occur in the liver of the definitive host and feed on blood. Mature flukes measure 4 to 10cm in length × 2 to 3.5cm in width, and have an oval dorso-ventrally flattened body with oral and ventral sucker. The flukes are reddish-brown in colour and are covered by <b>tegument.</b> As with other digenean trematodes, the life cycle includes intramolluscan phase in snails. The parasite is currently distributed in wild ruminants in North America and Europe, including Austria, Canada, Czechia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, and USA.|$|E

60|$|This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill {{be known}} to every one {{at one time}} or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self in every ones company, and so proud and {{aspiring}} withall, that it fears not to trample on the best, and affects {{nothing so much as a}} Crown; feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull any one by the ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it has drawn blood: it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches his head, as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against it, and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place, and run behind a mans back, though it go very much against the hair; which ill conditions of it having made it better known then trusted, would exempt me from making any further description of it, did not my faithful Mercury, my Microscope, bring me other information of it. For this has discovered to me, by means of a very bright light cast on it, that it is a Creature of a very odd shape; it has a head shap'd like that exprest in 35. Scheme marked with A, which seems almost Conical, but is a little flatted on the upper and under sides, at the biggest part of which, on either side behind the head (as it were, being the place where other Creatures ears stand) are placed its two black shining goggle eyes BB, looking backwards, and fenced round with several small cilia, or hairs that incompass it, so that it seems this Creature has no very good foresight: It does not seem to have any eye-lids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed, that it might the better cleanse them with its fore-legs; and perhaps this may be the reason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them, for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, and thence probably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear light, especially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to secure these eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it passes, it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be; each of these CC hath four joynts, which are fringed, as 'twere, with small brisles, from which to the tip of its snout D, the head seems very round and tapering, ending in a very sharp nose D, which seems to have a small hole, and to be the passage through which he sucks the blood. Now whereas if it be plac'd on its back, with its belly upwards, as it is in the 35. Scheme, it seems in several Positions to have a resemblance of chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by EE, yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept several of them in a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time they had nothing to feed on, I found, upon letting one creep on my hand, that it immediately fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its nose very deep into the skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could plainly perceive a small current of blood, which came directly from its snout, and past into its belly; and about A there seem'd a contrivance, somewhat resembling a Pump, pair of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift systole and diastole the blood seem'd drawn from the nose, and forced into the body. It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a good while as it was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very snout D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and yet the blood seem'd to run through its head very quick and freely, so that it seems there is no part of the skin but the blood is dispers'd into, nay, even into the cuticula; for had it thrust its whole nose in from D to CC, it would not have amounted to the supposed thickness of that <b>tegument,</b> the length of the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch. It has six legs, covered with a very transparent shell, and joynted exactly like a Crab's, or Lobster's; each leg is divided into six parts by these joynts, and those have here and there several small hairs; and at the end of each leg it has two claws, very properly adapted for its peculiar use, being thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin and hair; and indeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could not be made more commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite motions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then it is: for, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger (b) when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet are the same with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so with both claws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the Figure, the long transparent Cylinder FFF, being a Man's hair held by it.|$|E

40|$|Ecuadorian Theobroma subincanum (Sterculiaceae) seed {{parts were}} {{analyzed}} to determine quali-quantitative tocopherol distribution. Fatty acids and sterols in the embryos, <b>teguments</b> and endosperm were also evaluated with an aim to better-characterize the plant matrix for its potential {{use as a}} source of phytochemicals, for the cocoa butter processing industry and/or as a new source of low cost natural products in the cosmetic, drug and alimentary/nutraceutical industries. HPLC for tocopherols and gas-chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses for fatty acids profile (FAP) and phytosterols were performed. Tocopherols were particularly abundant in the embryo, with quali-quantitative data similar to wheat germ oil whereas, in the <b>teguments</b> and endosperm, the concentrations of tocopherols were lower. The fatty acid profile and phytosterol characterization of the seed parts showed qualitative homogeneous data. In the endosperm, 80 % of the entire FAP consisted of oleic and stearic acid while, among sterols, cycloartenol was more abundant in endosperm than ill embryos and <b>teguments.</b> Accordingly, T. subincanum seeds can be proposed as possible substitutes in the cocoa processing industry and as a potential source of vitamin E isomers.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to find the basic {{architecture}} underlying the known structures of the basidiospore walls some developmental patterns of the formation and reduction of the wall <b>teguments</b> are described. Spore walls are built from two classes of substances differing in their aspect in the electron microscope: an electron dense material and an electron transparent material. These two classes, by mixing and separation, form two classes of <b>teguments,</b> the eusporium and the myxosporium. The <b>teguments</b> are modified by differentiation and reduction processes. A processus called exogenisation leads from an endospore to a false exospore and eventually to a true exospore. A false exospore is morphologically an endospore but functionally an exospore. The wall of the apophyse contributes {{to the formation of}} the spore wall. The external layer becomes the sporothecium, the internal layer contributes to the myxosporium if it gelatinizes or to the eusporium if it does not gelatinize. Total reduction of the true spore wall leads to a replacement of the spore wall by the apophyse wall and thus to a true exospore. Some morphologic observations suggest that the basidiospore is not projected by the basidium, but that it actively jumps off the sterigma...|$|R

5000|$|The {{external}} surface of <b>tegument</b> {{is associated with}} unique defining structures in cestodes and trematodes. In cestodes the <b>tegument</b> is further covered with highly specialized microvilli, called [...] "microtriches", projecting from the outer limiting membrane of the <b>tegument.</b> These microtriches are fine hair-like filaments distributed throughout {{the surface of the}} body, and give the body surface a smooth and silky appearance. Since cestodes are devoid of any digestive and excretory systems, the <b>tegument</b> with its microtriches constitute the principal site of absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste materials. In fact the <b>tegument</b> highly resembles the gut of animals turned inside out.|$|E
50|$|A viral <b>tegument</b> or <b>tegument,</b> more {{commonly}} known as a viral matrix, is a cluster of proteins that lines {{the space between the}} envelope and nucleocapsid of all herpesviruses. The <b>tegument</b> generally contains proteins that aid in viral DNA replication and evasion of the immune response, typically with inhibition of signalling in the immune system and activation of interferons. The <b>tegument</b> is usually released shortly after infection into the cytoplasm. These proteins are usually formed within the late phase of the viral infectious cycle, after viral genes have been replicated. Much information regarding viral teguments has been gathered from studying Herpes simplex virus.|$|E
50|$|Endoparasites have various {{anatomical}} and biochemical adaptations, typically at the host-parasite interface, to maximise nutrient acquisition. One such adaptation is the <b>tegument,</b> a metabolically active external cover {{which plays}} an important role in the acquisition of nutrients from the host. The parasite <b>tegument</b> is permeable to various organic solutes and has transporters for the facilitated or active uptake of nutrients. Various studies have attempted to characterise these transporters in a number of parasites e.g. the amino acid transporter molecules in protozoa. Cestodes do not have a gut so the <b>tegument</b> is therefore critical for nutrient uptake. In cestodes the <b>tegument</b> is highly efficient with spine-like microtriches, similar to microvilli, to increase the surface area available for nutrient acquisition. In many parasites the <b>tegument</b> structure has folds or microvilli to maximise the surface area available for diffusion and uptake of nutrients. The <b>tegument</b> also commonly has additional organelles and features with important functions in metabolism including the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate-rich layer which enhances nutrient absorption and secretes enzymes to aid primary digestion.|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids {{are a large}} {{class of}} plant {{secondary}} metabolites, belonging to polyphenol family, which possess pharmacological and nutritional properties. Their synthesis takes place only in plants, while mammals can acquire them only with diet. It has been demonstrated that flavonoid uptake occurs in rat also by the activity of bilitranslocase, a carrier that is involved in anion transport in liver cell, vascular endothelium and gastric mucosa. A sequence of bilitranslocase interacting with flavonoid moieties is already known and characterized. Antibody raised against such protein epitope were shown to exhibit cross-reactivity against plant membrane proteins in tissues involved in flavonoid transport and accumulation, such as <b>teguments</b> of carnation petals and skin of grape berries.

40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made towards characterizing virus assembly processes, assignment of the site of tegumentation and envelopment for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is still not clear. In this study, we examined the envelopment of HCMV particles in human lung fibroblasts (HF) HL 411 and HL 19, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells at different time points after infection by electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy analysis. Double-immunofluorescence labeling experiments demonstrated colocalization of the HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) with the Golgi resident enzyme mannosidase II, the Golgi marker TGN (trans-Golgi network) 46, and the secretory vacuole marker Rab 3 in all cell types investigated. Final envel-opment of <b>tegumented</b> capsids was observed at 5 days postinfection by EM, when <b>tegumented</b> capsids budded into subcellular compartments located in the cytoplasm, in close proximity to the Golgi apparatus. Immuno-gold labeling and EM analysis confirmed staining of the budding compartment with HCMV gB, Rab 3, and mannosidase II in HL 411 cells.

Post mortem examination of a sample of 34 minnows revealed that 50 % (n= 17) of the population were infected with 13. 7 ± 2. 6 (mean ± standard error; range 1 - 38) metacercariae per infected host. Serial histological sections of the infected minnow brains revealed that the metacercariae were unevenly distributed throughout the brain, with aggregations occurring in the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata and the optic lobes. In fish with highest intensity of infection, respectively, over 40 % of cerebellar area and about 30 % of medulla oblongata area were occupied by larvae. Metacercariae disrupt the integrity of brain tissue, with individuals being found in small pockets surrounded by cellular debris.
