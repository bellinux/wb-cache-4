5000|$|A non-rigid armored vessel (#27) was {{designed}} that would withstand {{the rigors of}} most landings and preserve the air sample of approximately [...] It consisted of three nested cylinders of flexible materials that, from the outside to the inside, were: a tough outer layer of plasticized nylon; an intermediate layer of woven nylon with very high tear strength, and; an innermost cylinder of polyethylene film that {{would serve as a}} gas barrier for the air sample. At takeoff the armored vessel hung in a deflated form around the steel cable (#27) and below an open parachute (#23) that would provide braking of the system descent if the rate exceeded about 2000 feet per minute. Launching of this complex balloon system required special handling techniques, and the entire process was referred to as a platform launch, a novel concept developed by Harold E. Froehlich, principal engineer of the Balloons and Meteorological System Group. In this form of launching the load train, nearly 300 ft in length, was laid out on a ground cloth-covered runway with the lowest part of the load train in the upwind direction. The uppermost part of the system, the top of the lifting balloon, would be in the downwind direction. A heavy platform was positioned at a point toward the top of the lifting balloon, and the balloon material would pass over the platform and be securely held in place by a large horizontal padded roller about four feet in length. The helium inflation tube was located in the upper portion of the lifting balloon so that the helium source would inflate the section of the balloon beyond the platform. Since the system would be ascending to 80000 ft in altitude, only about 3% of the maximum balloon volume was filled with helium. The inflation took place by metering in an amount of helium lifting gas that would equal the gross weight of the system plus typically about 5% of ‘free lift’ to ensure that the system would ascend at an appropriate rate at the launching. Launching was initiated by releasing the padded roller on the launch platform. The ascending balloon would then sequentially pick up {{the lower part of the}} lifting balloon, the deployed parachute and armored vessel, the uninflated envelope, and lastly the heavy insulated bag containing the controller, blower, instruments, <b>telemetering</b> <b>equipment</b> and power supply. There were variations of this procedure that evolved to facilitate the launching. For example, the heavy instrument bag and blower assembly was eventually mounted on the front of a vehicle that drove under the balloon system as it ascended during launching, and the bag was released from the vehicle using small explosive devices. [...] Grab Bag flights were typically launched early in the morning and recovered during daylight hours of that same day. The ascent time to 80000 ft was usually about three hours. As the balloon system approached the ceiling altitude, the excess lift (referred to as [...] "free lift") that drove the system upward on launching filled out a duct system of the lifting balloon, and helium was automatically vented from the lifting balloon and slowed the ascent. As this process continued, the balloon system slowly ascended to the ceiling altitude and was in equilibrium, the lift of the helium balloon just balancing the total weight of the system. If this process took place as designed, about thirty minutes were needed to assure that the system was stable at the ceiling altitude of 80000 ft. If the system instruments indicated that the altitude was not changing, the blower attached to the sample envelope balloon at the base of the system was initiated by the controller. The effect of turning on the blower was almost immediately evident in the appearance of the sample balloon. Viewing the system through a tracking telescope clearly showed the sample envelope beginning to fill out. The sample gathering process typically required of the order of an hour or so to be completed, the appearance of the system then being of two balloons, one immediately on top of the other. The blower was then turned off by the controller and a valve closed that sealed the sample envelope from the outside. The autopilot was then activated by the controller, releasing helium from the lifting balloon (#116) and initiating a descent of the entire system. In practice, the descent of the system did not become apparent for of the order of an hour after the autopilot was activated. This was because the sample balloon, now containing a large volume of air, would generate lift with any descent due to adiabatic heating of the sample air in the isothermal stratosphere. It could require an hour or two to establish a nominal descent rate of the system. The descent to altitudes of the order of 15000 ft could take of the order of two to three hours. At this point the axial fan (#29) was automatically initiated to transfer air in the sample balloon into the armored vessel. This transfer was usually completed before the system reached an altitude of 4 or 5 thousand feet and a valve in the armored vessel valve just above the axial fan (#25) was sealed by the controller. As the system continued to descend and touched down, explosive cutters fired to release the lifting balloon from the lower part of the system and the armored vessel fell the short remaining distance, perhaps fifty feet, to the ground. Usually the recovery crew was at the landing site and immediately began the process of transferring the air sample from the armored vessel into high-pressure bottles for transfer to another laboratory for analyses. A series of six test flights were carried out in the Grab Bag development program in which various system elements were examined. The seventh flight would be the first attempt to capture the first air sample at 80000 ft in the Minneapolis area in mid-August 1953. The six test flights carried out tests of various system components, and included: tests and further development of the launching procedure for this complex system; an evaluation of the system controller; adequacy of the power supply and the autopilot function; a study of the blower function at altitude to evaluate both its function and the volume of air delivered into the sample balloon as compared to the laboratory results; evaluation of the process in which the axial fan transferred the air sample from the sample balloon into the armored vessel and the vessel was sealed; and in each case, further development of logistics for system launching and recovery.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} high sensitivity {{observation of}} apparent ground resistivity was first {{started at the}} Aburatsubo Crustal Movement Observatory (139 ° 37 'E, 35 ° 09 'N), Kanagawa Prefecture, about 60 km south of Tokyo on May 14, 1968. The initial intention was to observe the crustal movement reflected on the resistivity variation. The initial resistivity observation system consisted of the following sections : 1) four graphite electrodes buried in the floor ground of a small vault near the shoreline of the Aburatsubo Bay, with 1. 6 m distance in N 81 °W direction, 2) a 67 Hz type resistivity variometer and 3) two sets of aerial cables which connect the electrodes and the resistivity variometer. The apparent resistivity change {{in response to the}} tidal loading of the ground has been continuously recorded with a sensitivity as high as 102 compared with the earth'strain at Aburatsubo. Unexpectedly, on every occurrence of the remarkable earthquakes in the vicinity of Japan, the resistivity variation has been observed. Up to the present, the author observed 50 remarkable coseismic resistivity changes most of which are accompanied by the precursory resistivity change the order of hours preceding to the respective earth- quakes. From September 2, 1978, the prototype vacuum tube apparatus was replaced by an IC type two component resistivity variometer which is capable of a future coupling with a telemeter system without interfering with observation under continuous operation. On February 14, 1980, real time continuous telemetering of the resistivity variation to the author's laboratory at the Earthquake Research Institute was started through D 1 service line of Nippon Telephone and Telegram Agency (NTT) The telemeter system is a low-speed, 50 bits/sec, one-way, PCM <b>telemeter</b> <b>equipment</b> with four 8 bits channels. The first telemetered coseismic resistivity change at Aburatsubo was of an earth- quake of magnitude 5. 9 on March, 1980. The agreement of the directly recorded resistivity change at Aburatsubo and the telemetered record at the Earthquake Research Institute is quite satisfactory. The coseismic resistivity change for the earthquake of magnitude 6. 7 on June 29, 1980 is also shown at Aburatsubo...|$|R

40|$|The outlet canal from Lake Tuakitoto has two {{barriers}} to fish migration. One is the newly resited sill {{for the control}} of lake levels. Downstream is the second and more significant obstacle, the Kaitangata floodgates, which {{have been in place}} for over 40 years. The floodgates are only needed to protect the surrounding reclaimed swampland when the Clutha floods. However they block fish passage at all times. It is suggested that the operation strategy shift from continuous closure to closing only when a flood is anticipated. Modern <b>telemetering</b> and communications <b>equipment</b> means that this operation strategy could be easily attained. This portion of the lower Clutha River is still tidal. In addition to allowing native fish easy access into the outlet canal a further and major benefit would be the restoration of a minor tidal effect in Lake Tuakitoto. Apart from expanding the potential spawning area for fish which are known to spawn on water level fluctuations, such as inanga and banded kokopu, the tide would flow over the sill for a considerable number of days each month. Even weak swimming fish such as smelt and inanga and black flounder would then have easy access into the lake. The productivity of the lake margin can be expected to increase with regular tidal flooding, expanding feeding opportunities for native fish and waterfowl. Allowing a tidal movement in the outlet canal has much greater potential environmental benefits than constructing a fish pass, {{which may or may not}} function as desired. Construction and annual maintenance costs implicit in a fish pass would not be incurred. 2...|$|R
