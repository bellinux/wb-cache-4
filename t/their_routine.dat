5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin <b>their</b> <b>routine,</b> but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the largest}} {{political}} {{divisions of the}} Song known as circuits (lu) {{there were a number}} of prefectures (zhou), which in turn were divided into the smallest political units of counties (xian); there were about 1,230 counties during the Song period. The prefect during the early Northern Song was the prime official of local government authority, who was the lowest regional official allowed to memorialize the throne, was primary tax collector, and head magistrate over several magistrates within his jurisdiction that dealt with civil disputes and maintaining order. By the late Northern Song, the growth in the number of counties with different proportions in population under a prefect's jurisdiction decreased the importance of the latter office, as it became more difficult for the prefect to manage the counties. This was part of a larger continuum of administrative trends from the Tang to Ming dynasties, with the gradual decline of importance of intermediate administrative units—the prefectures—alongside a shift of power from central government to large regional administrations; the latter experienced progressively less influence of central government in <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> affairs. In the Southern Song, four semi-autonomous regional command systems were established based on territorial and military units; this influenced the model of detached service secretariats which became the provincial administrations (sheng) of the Yuan (1279–1368), Ming (1368–1644), and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties. The administrative control of the Southern Song central government over the empire became increasingly limited to the circuits located in closer proximity to the capital at Hangzhou, while those farther away practiced greater autonomy.|$|E

25|$|The UK {{passed the}} Bribery Act in 2010. This law made {{it illegal to}} bribe either {{government}} or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.|$|E

25|$|Male gymnasts also {{perform on}} a 12meter x 12meter spring floor. A series of {{tumbling}} passes are performed to demonstrate flexibility, strength, and balance. Strength skills include circles, scales, and press handstands. Men's floor routines usually have multiple passes {{that have to}} total between 60–70 seconds and are performed without music, unlike the women's event. Rules require that male gymnasts touch each corner of the floor at least once during <b>their</b> <b>routine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force {{does not}} {{recommend}} electrocardiography for routine screening procedure in patients without symptoms and those at low risk for coronary heart disease. This is because an ECG may falsely indicate {{the existence of}} a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, or overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> health evaluations.|$|E

25|$|The police mutiny {{broke out}} when the RIC were ordered to play a more {{participative}} role during <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> escort of traction engines driven by blackleg carters through the city. Blackleg carters had been recruited to drive the traction engines that {{had been sent to}} Belfast to deliver the goods which had been unable to leave the port due to the striking carters. The traction engines, equipped with makeshift armour, were almost always blocked en route by flying pickets. The RIC were enlisted to provide an escort for the blackleg carters, who constantly came under attack. In one incident in East Belfast, a crowd of shipyard workers threw a telegraph pole at a blackleg carter and his traction engine. The merchandise he had been transporting ended up in the nearby Connswater River.|$|E
25|$|Under CBS {{president}} James T. Aubrey, Jr. {{the pressures}} on CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly fought with Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman William S. Paley supported the news, however, and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly's relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired.|$|E

25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin <b>their</b> <b>routine</b> as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete <b>their</b> <b>routine.</b> Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly was not impressed with the video overall commenting, [...] "orget about low concept, we're talking no concept! For all the money spent capturing footage of impressive rooftop leaps, I wish Madonna had chosen instead to offer us a visually sumptuous slice of storytelling, {{something along the lines of}} 'Express Yourself' or 'Bedtime Story'." ...|$|E
