5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a <b>top-level</b> <b>domain</b> registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E

The first-level set of domain names are the <b>top-level</b> <b>domains</b> (TLDs), including the generic <b>top-level</b> <b>domains</b> (gTLDs), {{such as the}} prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code <b>top-level</b> <b>domains</b> (ccTLDs).

Some encourage their young people to go where they can earn good money to remit to their stay-at-home relatives. Many Polynesian locations, such as Easter Island, supplement this with tourism income.

25|$|The {{address bar}} {{features}} domain highlighting for added security {{so that the}} <b>top-level</b> <b>domain</b> is shown in black whereas {{the other parts of}} the URL are grayed out.

Designing a good selection policy has an added difficulty: it must work with partial information, as the complete set of Web pages is not known during crawling.|$|E

25|$|Although domain names may {{theoretically}} {{consist of}} any character representable in an octet, host names use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in their labels {{are a subset}} of the ASCII character set, consisting of characters a through z, A through Z, digits 0 through 9, and hyphen. This rule is known as the LDH rule (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in case-independent manner. Labels may not start or end with a hyphen. An additional rule requires that <b>top-level</b> <b>domain</b> names should not be all-numeric.|$|E
25|$|ICANN {{publishes the}} {{complete}} list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars.

For most {{of the more than}} 290 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, DENIC, Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. Since about 2001, most Generic <b>top-level</b> <b>domain</b> (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called thick registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.|$|E
