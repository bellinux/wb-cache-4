Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.|$|E
5|$|The story centres {{on a young}} engaged couple whose car {{breaks down}} in the rain near a castle where they seek a <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> call for help. The castle or country home is {{occupied}} by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover {{the head of the}} house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparent mad scientist who actually is an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.|$|E
5|$|Tisdale {{testified to}} passing the order by <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> Blue River and to Red Pass Junction, {{and that it}} was {{correctly}} read back to him by both operators. He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash, saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages. Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team Leeds United but their matches were marred by violence: two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events happened at 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans. Leeds fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> call for support when he saw Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between {{the two sets of}} supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Arthur's double, {{known as}} the Skinless Boy, has thrown a {{hospital}} near Arthur's home into panic by infecting staff and patients with a fungoid, extraterrestrial life-form which allows him to read and eventually control their thoughts and actions. This fungus, nicknamed Grayspot, is mistaken for a biological weapon, and the hospital put under quarantine. Leaf infiltrates the hospital, seeking to obtain and destroy the magical object used to create the Skinless Boy: a pocket torn from one of Arthur's shirts. She succeeds, but is infected by Grayspot in the process. She then leaves the hospital, {{only to find that}} the House has appeared above it and cannot be reached from the ground. With the help of a retired pharmacist named Sylvie, Leaf makes her way to Arthur's house where she uses a special <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> contact Arthur's friends and get help, just as the fungus gains full control of her body.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} is {{the only}} such building outside of the United Kingdom which is operated by Trinity House, a lighthouse agency based in England. Accordingly, it is {{also referred to as}} the Trinity Lighthouse. Trinity House became responsible for Europa Point Lighthouse at the time of an 1838 Act of Parliament. In addition, the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 resulted in Trinity House becoming the General Lighthouse Authority (GLA) for Gibraltar. The site of the lighthouse is managed by the Government of Gibraltar, and monitoring of the lighthouse is through a reporting station connected by <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> the Gibraltar Port Office. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Admiralty Digital Lists of Lights (ADLL) number for the Europa Point Lighthouse is D2438. The United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) number is 4220.|$|E
5|$|When Japanese forces {{took control}} of the Indies in 1942, the empire's Dōmei Tsushin news agency {{established}} a branch office in Jakarta. Antara was renamed Yashima on 29May, and it was eventually absorbed by the Dōmei news network three months later. Press activity flourished as Dōmei opened offices in major cities throughout Java. When Indonesia's independence was proclaimed on 17August 1945, Adam Malik obtained a copy of the text and dictated it by <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> his colleagues at the agency. The resulting news bulletin slipped past Japanese censors and was broadcast throughout Dōmei's newswire network. Dōmei officials attempted to retract the bulletin, but a courier was able to deliver a copy of the proclamation using the agency's name to the Hōsō Kanrikyoku radio station in midst of the confusion. Antara assumed control of Dōmei's local network when the Japanese surrendered to Allied forces weeks later and reopened under private management on 3September.|$|E

5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via <b>telephone</b> <b>to</b> ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E
