40|$|ABSTRACT Lamotrigine is an {{antiepileptic}} drug {{used for}} the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder and numerous off-label uses. The development of rash significantly affects its use. The most concerning of these adverse reactions is Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis.</b> We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials using lamotrigine as a monotherapy to quantify the incidence of cutaneous reactions, particularly Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis.</b> Of a total of 4, 364 papers regarding lamotrigine, 122 studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total, 18, 698 patients were included with 1, 570 (8. 3 %) of patients experiencing an adverse dermatologic reaction.

25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, <b>toxic</b> <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis,</b> {{erythema}} multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{nevirapine}} {{is the development}} of mild or moderate rash (13%).

25|$|Dangerous and {{potentially}} fatal skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and <b>toxic</b> <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis,</b> caused by carbamazepine therapy are significantly {{more common in}} people with a particular human leukocyte antigen allele, HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios {{for the development of}} Stevens-Johnson syndrome or <b>toxic</b> <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis</b> in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele {{has been shown to be}} a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine among Japanese and Europeans.|$|E
40|$|A 44 -year-old {{man with}} HIV, with a CD 4 + count of 45 /μl and a viral load of 88 000 copies/ml, who was {{completing}} therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, presented with severe bloody diarrhoea, fevers and abdominal pain.

40|$|Canine <b>toxic</b> <b>epidermal</b> {{necrosis}} (TEN), a {{rare and}} life-threatening cutaneous drug reaction, traditionally {{has been described as}} full-thickness devitalization of the epidermis with minimal dermal inflammation; however, few reports detail the histologic findings. We characterize the clinical features and histologic variations of 3 canine TEN patients. Clinically, irregular erythematous and purpuric macules evolved into widespread and severely painful erosions. The number of eroded mucosae varied; however, perio-cular and perilabial mucocutaneous junctions frequently were affected. Thirteen of 17 biopsies were evaluated. Apoptosis at mul-tiple epidermal levels was the most common pattern of epidermal necrosis (12 / 13 biopsies, 92 %). In contrast, full-thickness coagulation necrosis was present less often (7 / 13 biopsies, 52 %). Lymphocytic interface dermatitis was the predominant inflam-matory pattern, and intraepidermal lymphocytes, along with fewer histiocytes, were present to some degree in all samples along with lymphocytic satellitosis of apoptotic keratinocytes. The sequence of changes points to lymphocyte-mediated keratinocyte apoptosis as an early step in lesion development with subsequent variation in progression to coagulation necrosis among patients. Histopathologic changes overlapped with those reported for erythema multiforme, in contrast to traditional histologic descrip-tions of canine TEN. A specific algorithm for assessment of drug causality in <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis</b> (ALDEN) was applied for each patient; carprofen was associated with a probable score for causality in 1 dog. Clinicians should be encouraged to take multiple biopsies in TEN suspect cases as nearly 25 % of all biopsies lacked epithelium and were not diagnostic...|$|R

40|$|Case summary A 5 -year-old, spayed female, indoor-only {{domestic}} shorthair cat was referred with an acute history of multifocal cutaneous and mucocutaneous erosive-ulcerative lesions and skin detachment. The lesions {{occurred on the}} seventh day of therapy with cefadroxil. Erosive-ulcerative and occasionally crusted lesions were apparent on the medial and lateral canthus of both eyes, ventral neck, abdomen, perivulvar region, periungual skin and medial aspect of the front and hindlimbs. Diffuse and severe exfoliation was present on the dorsum and tail base and in both external ear canals. The cat was also dehydrated, tachycardic and febrile. Histopathological examination revealed extensive epidermal ulceration, interface dermatitis with vacuolar degeneration, apoptosis at multiple epidermal levels and basal, suprabasal and spinous dermoepidermal detachment. The histopathological diagnosis was consistent with Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic <b>epidermal</b> <b>necrolysis</b> (SJS/TEN). The recently reported Algorithm of Drug Causality in <b>Epidermal</b> <b>Necrolysis</b> (ALDEN), currently used in human medicine, was applied and a score of + 6 was calculated; this supported the view that SJS/TEN in this cat was very likely {{to be associated with}} cefadroxil administration.
