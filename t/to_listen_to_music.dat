25|$|Cortical {{thickness}} {{and reduced}} white matter – {{in a recent}} study, voxel-based morphometry, an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals as compared to controls. Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction. For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> than others, which could ultimately cause reduced myelination of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Idlewild, {{named after}} the quiet meeting place in Anne of Green Gables, formed in December 1995 in Edinburgh, Scotland when a 19-year-old Roddy Woomble met drummer Colin Newton at a party. The two {{discovered}} that they had much in common, including similar musical interests and record collections. By {{the end of the}} night, they had discussed forming a band together. On the same night, the two were introduced to guitarist Rod Jones and the three kept in contact afterwards, meeting up <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> Soon, the trio began writing songs together, and, in need of a bassist, they brought Phil Scanlon into the fold, {{due to the fact that}} he owned a bass guitar.|$|E
25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. From the moment he was captured, he continually {{wanted to know how}} many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E

25|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} reasons for {{the appearance of the}} blues are not fully known. The first appearance of the blues is usually dated after the Emancipation Act of 1863, between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with post-emancipation and later, the establishment of juke joints as places where blacks went <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> dance, or gamble after a hard day's work. This period corresponds to the transition from slavery to sharecropping, small-scale agricultural production, and the expansion of railroads in the southern United States. Several scholars characterize the development of blues music in the early 1900s as a move from group performance to individualized performance. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} written {{considering}} how popular music consumers chose <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> {{in the early}} 2010s: by listening to samples on a purchasing page, or to ringtone versions of a song, and from there deciding if they like a song or not. Yamaguchi {{wanted to create a}} song that was hard to critically review due to its complexity, and that music consumers could not evaluate listening to a single sample. Yamaguchi wrote a song that was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Andrianjafy {{may have}} been willing to accept his father's {{declared}} order of succession. This most likely changed when Ranavalondrazaka, Andrianjafy's wife, unexpectedly gave birth to a son. She persuaded Andrianjafy to disregard his father's decree and name their own son Ralaitokana as successor in place of Ramboasalama. Andrianjafy agreed to this proposal and devised a series of ruses to kill his nephew and clear the path to the throne for his son. In one instance, Andrianjafy invited his nephew <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> from a nearby cliff, intending to push him over the edge; Andriantsimitovizainitrimo, Andrianjafy's brother, warned his nephew of the plot, and Ramboasalama declined the invitation on the pretext of illness. In another instance, Andrianjafy claimed to be ill and sent for Ramboasalama with the intention of murdering him once they were alone together, but once again Andrianjafy's brother warned his nephew of the danger. The king then planned to have Ramboasalama murdered during a planned excursion through a nearby swamp, but Ramboasalama was warned and stayed behind.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the {{attempted}} murder of Ho, on 3 December 1979, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old Canadian student named Kenneth Ockenden, {{who had been on}} a tour of England visiting relatives. Nilsen encountered Ockenden as they both drank in a West End pub. Upon learning the youth was a tourist, Nilsen offered to show Ockenden several notable London landmarks; an offer which Ockenden accepted. Nilsen then invited the youth to his house on the promise of a meal and further drinks. The pair stopped at an off licence en route to Nilsen's Melrose Avenue residence and purchased whisky, rum and beer, with Ockenden insisting on sharing the bill. Although Nilsen was adamant he could not recall the precise moment he strangled Ockenden, he recalled that he strangled the youth with the cord of his (Nilsen's) headphones as Ockenden listened to music; he also recalled dragging the youth across his floor with the wire wrapped around his neck as he strangled him, before pouring himself half a glass of rum and continuing <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> upon the headphones with which he had strangled Ockenden.|$|E

500|$|The Bailey {{household}} {{was very}} religious; Rose {{and his family}} attended a Pentecostal church, where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school.

I wasn't allowed <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> Women were evil. Everything was evil." [...] He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister. Rose found solace in music from an early age. He sang in the church choir {{from the age of}} five, and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio. At Jefferson High School, he participated in the school chorus and studied piano. A second baritone, Rose began developing [...] "different voices" [...] during chorus practice to confuse his teacher. He eventually formed a band with his friends, one of whom was Jeff Isbell, later known as Izzy Stradlin.|$|E
500|$|R.E.M. was pivotal in the {{creation}} {{and development of the}} alternative rock genre. AllMusic stated, [...] "R.E.M. mark the point when post-punk turned into alternative rock." [...] In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and new wave genres that had preceded it. Music journalist Simon Reynolds noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s [...] "had taken whole swaths of music off the menu", particularly that of the 1960s, and that [...] "After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender." [...] Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its [...] "plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals" [...] and who [...] "wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America", one of [...] "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day." [...] With the release of Murmur, R.E.M. had the most impact musically and commercially of the developing alternative genre's early groups, leaving in its wake a number of jangle pop followers.|$|E

[...] It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album's title track, with producer Rico Love, which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired, such as Diplo. Usher's intention for the album was one [...] "that was not genre-specific but just experimental". During an episode of NBC's The Voice, Usher called the album [...] "by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself". Looking 4 Myself was chosen as the album's title as it described Usher's 'musical journey'.|$|E

[...] From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature.
