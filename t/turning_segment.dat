Hydrogel, with its high water content and three-dimensional architecture, is formed by a self-assembling peptide and has great potential for broad biomedical applications. The key challenge in controlling the functional properties of final biomaterials can be met by designing the peptide primary structure carefully {{at the beginning and}} developing a comprehensive understanding of peptide self-assembly pathways. In this study, we first designed a Ca 2 + responsive peptide (eD 2) using identified functional native domains from a spider flagelliform silk protein and the Ca 2 + binding domain of lipase Lip A from Serratia marcescens. Instead of directly linking the two peptide sequences, we rationally inserted the ion-binding motif into the silk structure sequence and made the new peptide inherit the physical characteristics of both model sequences and assemble into nanofibers when triggered by Ca 2 +. Next, we introduced the amphiphilic property to the eD 2 peptide by conjugating its N-terminus with a strong hydrophobic sequence from a trans-membrane segment of human muscle L-type calcium channel. This self-assembly peptide, called h 9 e, was responsive to Ca 2 +, solution pH, and selected proteins for hydrogel formation. Interestingly, the <b>turning</b> <b>segment</b> GSII of h 9 e was considered to {{play a critical role in}} construction of the finial matrix. This hypothesis was further demonstrated by exploiting a series of amphiphilic diblock model peptides with different conformational flexibility. The kinetic rate of peptide assembly was suggested as one of the key influences for peptide supramolecular assembly morphology. To better understand the peptide self-assembly process during hydrogel formation, the conformational, morphological, and mechanical properties of h 9 e molecules in different dimethylsulfoxide/H 2 O solutions were monitored by 1 D and 2 D proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron microscopy, and a rheometer. The h 9 e peptide hydrogel formed with Ca 2 + and albumin exhibited superior physiological and specific injectable properties, which provides a more realistic tool for 3 D cell culture and drug delivery. This study generates new knowledge and contributes to the field by leading to a better understanding the self-assembly hydrogel formation and designing peptides with unique properties for biomedical applications such as cell culture, drug delivery, and tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{insertion}} of methylene groups into the <b>turn</b> <b>segment</b> of beta-hairpin peptides {{has been investigated}} in the model sequence Boc-Leu-Val-Val-Dpro-delta-Ava-Leu-Val-Val-OMe. This sequence {{is related to the}} previously well-characterized model beta-hairpin octapeptide, Boc-Leu-Val-Val-DPro-Gly-Leu-Val-Val-OMe. Replacement of Gly by delta-Ava (delta-aminovaleric acid) formally corresponds to expansion of the <b>turn</b> <b>segment</b> from a two-residue loop to a three-residue loop. Backbone proton chemical shifts, vicinal coupling constants, and circular dichroism spectra for the two peptides are virtually indistinguishable. Nuclear Overhauser effects corresponding to short cross-strand interproton distances confirm that the registry of the beta-hairpin structure is maintained in the delta-Ava peptide. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations, using experimental constraints, yield two structural families that are consistent with the NOE data. Both families correspond to beta-hairpin conformations and differ only in the backbone torsion angles at the delta-Ava residue...|$|R

Often the repeating unit is a helix-turn-helix motif, {{but it can be}} more elaborate, as in variants with an additional helix in the <b>turn</b> <b>segment.</b> Alpha solenoids can be formed by several different types of helical repeats, including HEAT repeats, Armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, leucine-rich repeats, and ankyrin repeats.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the race {{characteristics}} of the start and <b>turn</b> <b>segments</b> of national and regional level swimmers. In the study, 100 and 200 -m events were analysed during the finals session of the Open Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) tournament. The “individualized-distance” method with two-dimensional direct linear transformation algorithm was used to perform race analyses. National level swimmers obtained faster velocities in all race segments and stroke comparisons,although significant inter-level differences in start velocity were only obtained in half (8 out of 16) of the analysed events. Higher level swimmers also travelled for longer start and turn distances but only in the race segments where the gain of speed was high. This was observed in the <b>turn</b> <b>segments,</b> in the backstroke and butterfly strokes and during the 200 -m breaststroke event, but not in any of the freestyle events. Time improvements due to the appropriate extension of the underwater subsections appeared to be critical for the end race result and should be carefully evaluated by the “individualized-distance” method...|$|R
50|$|Another {{category}} of <b>segmented</b> <b>turning</b> called Open <b>Segmented</b> <b>Turning</b> {{is similar to}} ring construction but small gaps are left between the segments. Successive rings are offset so the segments interlock with the ring above and below. This type of segmentation seems very delicate and is somewhat transparent but it is generally quite strong. This concept was introduced by Yosh Sugiyama in the early 1980s. For example see the work of William Smith.|$|R

40|$|The β <b>turn</b> <b>segment</b> in {{designed}} peptide hairpins {{has been}} expanded by {{the insertion of}} β-, γ- and δ amino acids at the i+ 2 position. The model octapeptides Boc-Leu-Phe-Val-^DPro-Ac_ 6 c-Leu-Phe-Val-OMe (1), Boc-Leu-Phe-Val-^DPro-β^ 3 -Ac_ 6 c-Leu-Phe-Val-OMe (2),and Boc-Leu-Phe-Val-^DPro-Gpn-Leu-Phe-Val-OMe (3) {{have been shown to}} adopt β hairpin conformations in methanol by the observation of key diagnostic nuclear Overhauser effects. Boc-Leu-Val-Val-^DdPro-δ-Ava-Leu-Val-Val-OMe (4) adopts a β hairpin conformation in crystals; this is stabilized by three cross-strand hydrogen bonds as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction. The canonical C_ 10 turn in an α–α segment is expanded to C_ 11, C_ 12,and C_ 13 turns in α–β, α–γ, and α–δ segments,respectively. The crystal structures of Piv-^LPro-β^ 3 -Ac_ 6 c-NHMe (5) and Boc-Ac_ 6 c-Gpn-Ac_ 6 c-OMe (6) reveal intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded C_ 11 and C_ 12 conformations, respectively. Computer modeling of octapeptide sequences that contain centrally positioned hybrid-turn <b>segments,</b> by using <b>turn</b> parameters derived from the structures of peptides 5 and 6,establishes the stereochemical acceptability of the β hairpins in the cases of peptides 2 and 3. Accommodation of ω-amino acids into the <b>turn</b> <b>segments</b> is achieved by the adoption of gauche conformations around the backbone C - C bonds...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{investigation}} were to determine the evolution of selected turn variables during competitive backstroke races and to compare these kinematic variables between two different levels of swimmers. Sixteen national and regional level male swimmers participant in the 200 m backstroke event at the Spanish Swimming Championships in short course (25 m) were selected to analyze their turn performances. The individual distances method with two-dimensional Direct Linear Transformation (2 D-DLT) algorithms was used to perform race analyses. National level swimmers presented a shorter “turn time”, a longer “distance in”, a faster “underwater velocity” and “normalized underwater velocity”, and a faster “stroking velocity” than regional level swimmers, whereas {{no significant differences were}} detected between levels for the “underwater distance”. National level swimmers maintained similar “turn times” over the event and increased “underwater velocity” and “normalized underwater velocity” in the last (seventh) <b>turn</b> <b>segment,</b> whereas regional level swimmers increased “turn time” in {{the last half of the}} race. For both national and regional level swimmers, turn “underwater distance” during the last three turns of the race was significantly shorter while no significant differences in distance into the wall occurred throughout the race. The skill level of the swimmers has an impact on the competitive backstroke <b>turn</b> <b>segments.</b> In a 200 m event, the underwater velocity should be maximized to maintain turn proficiency, whereas turn distance must be subordinated to the average velocity...|$|R

40|$|The {{finding that}} {{peptides}} containing -amino acid residues {{give rise to}} folding patterns hitherto unobserved in -amino acid peptides[1] has stimulated considerable interest in the conformational properties of peptides built from,, and residues,[2] as the introduction of additional methylene (CH 2) units into peptide chains provides further degrees of conformational freedom.

40|$|Abstract. Identification of {{deceased}} individuals {{based on}} dental characteristics is receiving increased attention. Dental radiographic films {{of an individual}} are usually composed into a digital image record. In order to achieve high level of automation in postmortem identification, {{it is necessary to}} decompose dental image records into their constituent radiographic films, which are in <b>turn</b> <b>segmented</b> to localize dental regions of interest. In this paper we offer an automatic hierarchical treatment to the problem of cropping dental image records into films. Our approach is heavily based on concepts of mathematical morphology and shape analysis. Among the many challenges we face are non-standard assortments of films into records, variability in record digitization as well as randomness of record background both in intensity and texture. We show by experimental evidence that our approach achieves high accuracy and timeliness. ...|$|R
