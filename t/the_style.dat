5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. <b>The</b> <b>style</b> consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of <b>the</b> <b>style</b> in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if <b>the</b> <b>style</b> is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E

40|$|In the francophone {{literature}} entitled Le Rocher de Tanios, (which is {{translated into}} “Cadas Tanios” in Indonesian), {{there are numerous}} transformations of <b>the</b> <b>styles.</b> When compared with Cadas Tanios, <b>the</b> <b>styles</b> in Le Rocher de Tanios exhibit several forms of transformations. Those forms may be recognized as <b>the</b> different <b>style</b> and <b>the</b> zero <b>style</b> once <b>the</b> French text has been translated into the Indonesian text. It can also be said that <b>the</b> “x” <b>style</b> in <b>the</b> French text creates a “y” <b>style</b> in <b>the</b> Indonesian text. <b>The</b> x <b>style</b> in <b>the</b> French text may also create <b>the</b> zero <b>style</b> in <b>the</b> Indonesian text.

5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. <b>The</b> <b>style</b> and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But <b>the</b> <b>style</b> may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep it alive in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E

5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of <b>the</b> <b>style</b> {{in the early nineteenth}} century was Abbotsford House, the residence the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. <b>The</b> <b>style</b> was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69). The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–8 confirmed the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
