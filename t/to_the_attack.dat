5|$|Some historians {{dispute the}} degree to which the Akutan Zero {{influenced}} the outcome of the air war in the Pacific. For example, the Thach Weave, a tactic created by John Thach and used with great success by American airmen against the Zero, was devised by Thach prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> on Pearl Harbor, based on intelligence reports on the Zero's performance in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 9/11 attack resulted in immediate responses to the event, including domestic reactions, hate crimes, Muslim American responses to the event, international responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> and military responses to the events. An extensive compensation program was quickly established by Congress in the aftermath to compensate the victims and families of victims of the 9/11 attack as well.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of rest, they {{returned}} to the line near Broodseinde on 1 October, taking up a position near Molenaarelsthoek, on the right of I Anzac's position for the upcoming battle. The attack went in on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture their objectives. During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded, some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E
5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a series}} of harassing attacks by Saladin's, battle was joined {{on the morning of}} 7 September 1191. Richard's army {{successfully}} resisted attempts to disrupt its cohesion until the Hospitallers broke ranks and charged; Richard then committed all his forces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> He regrouped his army after its initial success, and led it to victory. The battle resulted in the coastal area of central Palestine, including the port of Jaffa, returning to Christian control.|$|E

5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman’s Creek {{with his}} 80 {{men of the}} 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre’s 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt’s Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler’s invaders had already gone, and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby’s 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, where they found Captain King and his men still waiting to be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Kluge {{ordered the}} attack to be {{mounted on the}} night of 6/7 August. To avoid {{alerting}} American forces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was forced}} to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia {{division}} of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in {{an attack on the}} U.S. II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the U.S. positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} was French reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> Gaddafi had possibly believed that, {{due to the}} upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February, Jirgalang {{announced}} that the Shunzhi Emperor, {{who was about to}} turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed. Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon's clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon's former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.|$|E
