5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, Iowa caucuses, which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E
25|$|McCain's {{second quarter}} 2007 {{fundraising}} results and campaign financials were poor. Both McCain supporters and political observers pointed to McCain's {{support for the}} Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, very unpopular among <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> electorate, as a primary cause of his fundraising problems.|$|E
50|$|Faced with a war {{situation}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Army <b>based</b> its {{organization in}} the mixed brigades (brigadas mixtas). Each of these was composed of four battalions. Every battalion included a number of companies. A regular brigada mixta would not exceed 3,000 men.|$|R
25|$|Lucas {{wrote about}} the need for LGBT people to {{reassess}} conservatives in August 2010, citing Ann Coulter {{as an example of a}} gay-friendly conservative leader. One month later he attended the GOProud 2010 convention, where he argued with Coulter about the perception of her anti-gay jokes among <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party's <b>base</b> voters.|$|R
50|$|On 8 January 1939 Admiral Luis González de Ubieta was {{transferred}} to Minorca to take the command of <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> naval <b>base</b> at Puerto Mahon. He also was given the authority to command all <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> military forces on the island.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> in Virginia {{consists}} of the state's traditional Republican heartland in the Blue Ridge Mountains, social conservatives in the Shenandoah Valley and suburbanites in the east. McCain closely matched George W. Bush's numbers among the first group and only did slightly worse than Bush amongst the second group. However, in 2008, suburbanites in Northern Virginia and in the Richmond/Hampton Roads areas abandoned the Republican Party in droves, and it was simply impossible for McCain to win the state without their support.|$|E
25|$|Historically speaking, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> {{initially}} {{consisted of}} northern white Protestants and African-Americans nationwide, {{with the first}} Presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, receiving almost no votes in the South. This trend continued into the 20th century, with 1944 Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey having only 10% of his popular votes in the South. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the core base shifted considerably, with the Southern United States becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics, and the Northeastern United States becoming more reliably Democratic, especially since 1992. Every Northeastern state except for New Hampshire has voted Democratic six straight elections or more.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{nominated}} Stevenson for the United States Congress in 1874. Stevenson was well-liked by Republicans and levied {{influence in}} the local Masonic lodge. Stevenson also received the nomination of the Independent Reform Party, a state party that fought monopolies following the Panic of 1873. Stevenson campaigned against Republican incumbent John McNulta. He attacked McNulta's support for high tariffs and {{what became known as}} the Salary Grab Act, where congressmen increased their salaries by 50%. He spoke little of his own positions other than railroad regulation. McNulta attacked back, accusing Stevenson membership in the Knights of the Golden Circle. Thanks to the votes siphoned away from <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Base</b> by the Independent Reform Party, Stevenson won the election with 52% of the vote, though he did not carry his hometown of Bloomington. He was elevated to the 44th United States Congress, the first under Democratic control since the Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|Romney's victory {{method was}} {{established}} by performing strongly with <b>the</b> (modest) <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> vote in <b>the</b> state, capturing many independent voters in the belt between Route 128 and [...] I-495, almost running even in smaller working-class cities, and holding down Democratic margins in large urban areas. [...] The conclusion represented the fourth win in a row for <b>Republicans</b> in <b>the</b> state gubernatorial contest.|$|R
25|$|A large Free State force takes Drogheda, County Louth. <b>The</b> <b>republicans</b> are <b>based</b> in Millmount Fort, which {{overlooks the}} town and also hold the railway station. National Army troops bring up mortars and 18 pounder guns to shell them. After several hours of bombardment, the Anti-Treaty fighters surrender. There is also some {{fighting}} at the railway station in the town, which again ends in the surrender of <b>the</b> <b>republicans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{initially}} {{heralded as}} a victory for Clinton and Democrats in congress, it proved costly. The bill energized <b>the</b> NRA and <b>Republican</b> <b>base,</b> and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> takeover of both houses in the 1994 mid-term elections. Many Democrats who had supported Clinton's gun control measures were ousted, including Speaker Tom Foley. Clinton acknowledged that he had hurt Democrats with his victories.|$|R
500|$|As his {{eventual}} entrance neared, Thompson spent {{additional time}} in Iowa {{and announced that}} his campaign strategy would focus on {{the state and its}} nonbinding straw poll held in August. Former Iowa State Representative Steve Grubbs was added as the campaign's consultant for the state. [...] Grubbs had planned to work on the presidential campaign of Senator George Allen, but his usage of an offensive term prevented him from entering the race. Though Thompson was not yet considered a [...] "viable candidate", Grubbs felt that the frontrunners John McCain, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney were unacceptable to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base.</b> He believed that Thompson [...] "had more experience" [...] than any other candidate, and could unify the party.|$|E
2500|$|Romney's loss {{prompted}} the Republican National Committee {{to try to}} appeal to the American Latino population by concentrating on different approaches to immigration. [...] These were short-lived due to activity and anger from <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> and {{may have contributed to the}} selection of Donald Trump as their presidential candidate four years later.|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{began the}} {{campaign}} as the apparent frontrunner among Republicans, with {{a strategy of}} appearing as the establishment, inevitable candidate; his campaign website featured an Associated Press article describing him as [...] " [...] political celebrity". He made substantial overtures towards elements of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> that had resisted his 2000 insurgency campaign. However, he soon fell behind in polls and fundraising; by July 2007 his campaign was forced to restructure its size and operations. The tide of Republican sentiment against immigration reform legislation he sponsored also led to the erosion of his lead.|$|E
50|$|In December 1795, the Directoire named Lazare Hoche chief {{general of}} all <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> forces <b>based</b> in <b>the</b> West {{and gave him}} full authority.

25|$|The Federalists {{promoted}} {{the financial system}} of Treasury Secretary Hamilton, which emphasized federal assumption of state debts, a tariff to pay off those debts, a national bank to facilitate financing, and encouragement of banking and manufacturing. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>based</b> in <b>the</b> plantation South, opposed a strong executive power, were hostile to a standing army and navy, demanded a limited reading of the Constitutional powers of the federal government, and strongly opposed the Hamilton financial program. Perhaps even more important was foreign policy, where the Federalists favored Britain because of its political stability and its close ties to American trade, while <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> admired <b>the</b> French and the French Revolution. Jefferson was especially fearful that British aristocratic influences would undermine republicanism. Britain and France were at war 1793–1815, with one brief interruption. American policy was neutrality, with the federalists hostile to France, and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> hostile to Britain. The Jay Treaty of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state. President Washington, while officially nonpartisan, generally supported the Federalists and that party made Washington their iconic hero.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1994, he drew a primary challenger. Republican James Brodbelt Harris, a {{financial}} analyst from Zanesville, Ohio, decided to challenge him in 2006. Harris did not campaign, and collected less than $5,000 in campaign contributions. On May 2, 2006, Ney defeated him 68%–32%. On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent. That would be a sign that there is a chunk of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> that's disenchanted with the incumbent." [...] Commenting on his situation after the primary, Ney said [...] "I have a healthy campaign account, in contrast to the Democratic Party, which is deeply divided and has a candidate with almost no campaign cash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fans of NASCAR are {{generally}} {{considered by the}} media of the United States to fall within <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base</b> as an [...] "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the [...] "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" [...] who were coveted in {{the first decades of}} 21st century during electoral campaigns. Joe Gibbs, a NASCAR team owner, spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates. Texas Governor, Rick Perry sponsored 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte's car for an election campaign in 2010. Labonte was reported to have been paid $225,000 to carry the [...] "rickperry.org" [...] logo. Two years later, Rick Santorum sponsored Tony Raines' car. In 2000, then Republican primary candidate Rudy Giuliani made an appearance at the Daytona International Speedway.|$|E
2500|$|Although Atwater clearly {{approved}} {{of the use of}} the Willie Horton issue, the Bush campaign never ran any commercial with Horton's picture; instead they ran a similar but generic ad. The original commercial was produced by Americans for Bush, an independent group managed by Larry McCarthy, and Republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media. Referring to Dukakis, Atwater declared that he would [...] "strip the bark off the little bastard" [...] and [...] "make Willie Horton his running mate". Atwater's challenge was to counter the [...] "where was George?" [...] campaign slogan Democrats were using as a rallying cry in an effort to create an impression that Bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate. Furthermore, Bush had critics in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base,</b> who remembered his pro-choice positions in the 1980 primary, and that the harder the campaign pursued Dukakis's liberal positions, the bigger his base turnout would be.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, {{there were signs}} that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>base</b> was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush {{at the same time}} in 2000.|$|R

50|$|The Yemeni {{military}} {{has suffered from}} sharp divisions since Major General Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar defected in late March 2011 amid protests demanding the ouster of Hadi's predecessor, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The military protests extended to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Guard <b>based</b> in <b>the</b> south of Sana'a when dozens from the Fourth Brigade closed down southern entrances to the capital city and demanded the firing of the brigade's commander, Mohammad Al-Arar, and his general staff.|$|R
2500|$|Grover and Republican Senator John G. Tower {{disagreed}} {{over the}} focus of the GOP. [...] Grover wanted the party to move in a populist direction to attract those who had previously favored Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, for president and combine those otherwise traditionally Democratic voters with <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>base,</b> consisting mostly of fiscal conservatives. Tower favored a different approach to expand the party by attracting middle-of-the-roaders who stressed [...] "good government" [...] and those with economically conservative views. Tower and Grover nearly came to fisticuffs in the 1972 campaign when Ernest Angelo, the new mayor of Midland, tried to get the two to work out their differences. The bitterness persisted. While Grover lost his race to Briscoe, Tower was a relatively easy winner for a third term in the Senate over Democrat Harold [...] "Barefoot" [...] Sanders, a former federal judge. The Grover approach appeared to have been vindicated with the 1976 primary victory of former California Governor Ronald W. Reagan in the first Texas GOP presidential primary in which voters chose the delegates. Indeed, Grover supported Reagan in 1976 over Tower's choice, then U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. [...] Tower's approach was, however, consistent with the later successes in Texas of the two George Bushes. In his 1991 autobiography, Tower referred to Grover in only one paragraph.|$|E

2500|$|This {{approach}} was espoused by the militant Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade led by Padraig McKearney and Jim Lynagh, who wanted an {{escalation of the}} conflict to what they termed [...] "total war". They were opposed by Kevin McKenna, the IRA Chief of Staff, and by <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> leadership <b>based</b> around Gerry Adams, {{on the grounds that}} actions of that scale were too big a risk and unsustainable. The IRA leadership wanted a smaller scale campaign of attrition, supplemented by political campaigning by Sinn Féin.|$|R
25|$|However the Civil {{war began}} before the Infantería de Marina was officially disbanded and in October 1936 the War Ministry was {{replaced}} by the 'National Defence Ministry' (Ministerio de la Defensa Nacional), led by the prime minister, Largo Caballero. Thus <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> Navy Marines of the areas of Spain that had remained loyal to the government were not disbanded and became part of the new military structure of the republic. At <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> naval <b>base</b> of Cartagena the Tercio de Levante Marine corps was garrisoned and used mainly for guarding moored ships and naval facilities, as well as for manning anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
