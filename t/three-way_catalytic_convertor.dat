40|$|In September 1998 the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) {{published}} the fourth National Environmental Balance (MB 98) in Dutch. Here, the environmental quality resulting (partly) {{from the environmental}} policy at the time is quantified for the period 1985 - 1997. Supplemental to this fourth Environmental Balance is an outlook for the period 1997 - 2002. This report serves as a background document for the section on transport in the MB 98. Major conclusions drawn from this outlook are: (1) {{the increase in the}} use of most transport modes in 1997 compared to 1996 and the prediction that in 2000 the use of passenger cars will be approximately 5 % higher than the SVV-II policy target; (2) the increase in CO 2 emissions by road traffic up to at least 2002, mainly because short-term improvements in energy efficiency of passenger cars are not expected; (3) the decrease in other emissions (aerosols, CO, VOC, NOx and SO 2) {{as a result of the}} successful penetration of the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> in the passenger car and light-duty vehicle stocks, as well as a further decrease forecasted for the emissions up to 2002, except for SO 2; (4) the approximate 7 % increase in CO 2 emissions from the use of Dutch bunker fuels by international sea and air transport in 1997 compared to 1996. CO 2 emissions from these bunker fuels amount to more than twice the CO 2 emissions from passenger cars on Dutch territory...|$|E

The introduction of the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium.

40|$|Designing {{automotive}} catalysts {{for effective}} control of NOx, HC and CO emissions under both lean and stoichiometric engine operation is a challenging task. The present work assesses the performance efficiency of a three-zone prototype <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> in reducing exhaust emissions from a gasoline engine, operating in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Spark Ignition (SI) mode under lean and stoichiometric conditions. The {{performance of the}} convertor for HC oxidation follows the order: lean HCCI > stoichiometric SI > stoichiometric HCCI. The study mainly focused on the quantitative analysis of C 1 –C 7 hydrocarbon compounds {{before and after the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor.</b> The results show that monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene are present at higher concentrations in the exhaust under HCCI operation than in the SI case. On the other hand, benzene concentrations are higher in the SI exhaust. The most common exhaust products of the two engine operating modes are methane, ethylene, propylene, benzene, and toluene. The prototype <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> eliminates most of the hydrocarbon species in the exhaust under both combustion modes, especially with a lean mixture. Conversion efficiencies for the different hydrocarbon species over the catalyst were in the order of alkenes > alkanes > aromatics. Hydrogen was added upstream of the catalyst primarily to assess its ability to promote NOx reduction, however it was also found to influence the oxidation characteristics of the catalyst. During H 2 addition, the methane concentration was higher downstream of the catalyst...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the ignition retardation on the fuel consumption, the cumulative tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions, and the temperature inside the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> converter in a gasoline direct injection engine operated under idling conditions. A dedicated cylinder-individual, model-based, multivariable controller was used in experiments in order to isolate the effect of the ignition retardation on the hydrocarbon emissions as much as possible. An optimal control problem for a gasoline engine at a cold-start is formulated, which is used to interpret the experimental data obtained. The corresponding goal is to minimize the fuel consumption during an initial idling phase of a fixed duration while guaranteeing that the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> converter reaches a sufficiently high final temperature {{and at the same time}} making sure that the cumulative hydrocarbon emissions stay below a given limit. The experimental data indicates that the engine should be operated with maximum ignition retardation in order to reach any temperature inside the <b>three-way</b> <b>catalytic</b> converter as quickly as possible concurrently with minimum tailpipe emissions and with the minimum possible fuel consumption...|$|R

40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> <b>convertors</b> of {{after-treatment}} systems take up {{a challenging}} task to reduce emission effectively and reliably in exhausts of gasoline and diesel engines. Exhaust emission fluctuates during the driving period and this may indicate engine malfunction. The concentration of carbon monoxide in combustion gases can give an indication about the general state of this process. Real-time signals from other gases (e. g. NOx) would also be {{needed in order to}} establish a basis for more sophisticated control procedures. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>convertors</b> can help to detect such failure by means of embedded and OBD-integrated sensors. In this respect, semiconducting materials can be employed. Among those, the metal oxides such as SnO 2 and TiO 2 can detect NO/NO 2 if doped with trivalent elements (e. g. Cr 3 +, Al 3 +, etc.). It is reported that the selectivity of TiO 2 -sensors towards NO 2 in oxygen containing environment increases by doping with aluminium at operation temperatures as high as 500 °C (1). Moreover, the incorporation of Cr up to 10 at...|$|R

40|$|The Automobile {{pollution}} {{is the major}} source of pollution. The majority of the environmental {{pollution is}} from the two-wheeler automobiles due to their large number. A study on nano-particle reveals that the ratio of surface area of nano-particle to the volume of the nano-particle is inversely proportional to the radius of the nano-particle. So, on decreasing the radius, this ratio is increased leading to an increased rate of reaction and the concentration of the pollutants is decreased. To achieve this objective, an innovative design of catalytic converter for two-wheeler automobiles is proposed using nano-particle as a catalyst. This research paper basically deals with the behavioral modeling and simulation of two stroke engine with developed <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor.</b> The basic idea of behavioral modeling starts from analyzing the practical behavior of two stroke engine with designed <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor,</b> and then approximating obtained behavior in terms of mathematical equations.

40|$|AbstractThe current {{scenario}} of high {{growth rate of}} automobile usage, the automobile industry is forced to adopt the government emission norms to keep the environment green. Latest technologies have been developed in the automotive exhaust system to acknowledge the emission norms. Diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler both are playing major roles in reducing emission and noise level as well. Diesel oxidation catalyst reduces CO and unburned HC emissions. Muffler reduces noise level of exhaust gases. Nowadays automobile industry is using CFD software extensively to analyze the flow properties inside the diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler. Flow analysis helps to optimize the geometric design of Diesel oxidation catalyst to oxidize the CO and unburned HC of exhaust gases. In this present work we studied pressure drop and uniformity index of an existing exhaust system which consists of close couple <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor,</b> under body <b>catalytic</b> <b>convertor</b> and muffler.

Based on the study, individual system contributions to the total pressure drop and flow uniformity have been analyzed and improvement areas of the existing system for better flow uniformity have been suggested...|$|R
