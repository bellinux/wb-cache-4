One such defect is the deep unknown center (DX, discussed in the following section), which forms when shallow donors convert into deep donors after a large lattice relaxation [30]. When <b>the</b> background <b>oxygen</b> is depleted (4 × 10 − 1 and 8 × 10 − 2 Torr conditions), the ZnO lattice undergoes a dynamic equilibrium between <b>the</b> chemisorbed <b>oxygen</b> and <b>the</b> interstitial <b>oxygen</b> (anion) vacancies.

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases {{trapped in the}} ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites.

This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>the</b> {{presence}} of <b>oxygen</b> in free radical polymerization systems leads to an inhibition period and a lowered ultimate conversion.

5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> carrier in most mollusks {{and some}} arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus).

5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers <b>the</b> <b>oxygen</b> affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E
