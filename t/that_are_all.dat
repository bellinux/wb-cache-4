5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> similar to each other.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E

5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo {{is part of}} the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{which includes}} nine genera <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> restricted to Madagascar. Before the discoveries of Monticolomys (published in 1996) and Voalavo (1998), all of the known genera within Nesomyinae were quite distinct from each other, so much so that phylogenetic relationships among them long remained obscure. Like Monticolomys (closely related to Macrotarsomys), however, Voalavo shows clear similarities to another nesomyine genus, Eliurus. In their description of Voalavo, Carleton and Goodman argued that, although closely related, Eliurus and Voalavo form separate monophyletic groups; but a 1999 molecular phylogenetic study by Sharon Jansa and colleagues, who compared cytochrome b sequences among nesomyines and other rodents, found that northern voalavo was more closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat than to other species of Eliurus. This finding called into question the separate generic status of Voalavo. However, tissue samples of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a species that is thought to be closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, were not available, so this species could not be included in the study. Data from nuclear genes also supports the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E

25|$|If {{the system}} is rescaled, the change in {{conductivity}} depends only on the distance between a fixed saddle point and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> in different universality classes {{have been found to}} share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under the right circumstances can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in quantum chromodynamics and might have been important {{in the formation of the}} early universe.|$|E

Of these moves the valence-one homotopy always reduced the PerronFrobenius eigenvalue.|$|E
