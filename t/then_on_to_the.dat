5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E

5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E
5|$|The ecclesiastical {{structure}} of the Roman Empire survived the movements and invasions in the west mostly intact, but the papacy was little regarded, and few of the Western bishops looked to the bishop of Rome for religious or political leadership. Many of the popes prior to 750 were more concerned with Byzantine affairs and Eastern theological controversies. The register, or archived copies of the letters, of Pope Gregory the Great (pope 590–604) survived, and of those more than 850 letters, the vast majority were concerned with affairs in Italy or Constantinople. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory had sent the Gregorian mission in 597 to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. Irish missionaries were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and the 7th centuries, going first to England and Scotland and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continent. Under such monks as Columba (d. 597) and Columbanus (d. 615), they founded monasteries, taught in Latin and Greek, and authored secular and religious works.|$|E

25|$|When {{the line}} opened, the scope for {{passenger}} services was limited - {{the entire population}} of the sparsely populated Hoo Peninsula was only 3,405. Nevertheless, in October 1891 there were 9 daily trains, approximately one every two hours from 6am on weekdays and Saturdays, and three on Sundays. The total journey time was 1 hour. Down trains would depart from Gravesend and call at Sharnal Street and Port Victoria, before a steamer would take passengers across the River Medway on to Sheerness. From Sheerness passengers could take the Medway Ferry Service to Folkestone and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continent.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} built to Design 1013, as part of wartime orders by the United States Shipping Board (USSB). She was laid down by Northwest Steel of Portland, Oregon, with the name West Minsi. The USSB order was {{cancelled}} during construction, but Northwest Steel completed the ship for private sale. She was sold to the Green Star Line before launching in November 1919, and was assigned the name Centaurus. The freighter was sold to Nafra in 1920, <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Planet Steamship Company in 1923. In 1929, the ship was sold to the Calmar Steamship Company, who renamed the ship Portmar.|$|E
25|$|Two expeditions {{preceded the}} 1924 effort. The first in 1921 was an {{exploratory}} expedition led by Harold Raeburn which described a potential route along the whole northeast ridge. Later George Mallory proposed a longer modified {{climb to the}} north col, then along the north ridge to reach the northeast ridge, and <b>then</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit. This approach {{seemed to be the}} “easiest” terrain to reach the top. After they had discovered access {{to the base of the}} north col via the East Rongbuk Glacier, the complete route was explored and appeared to be the superior option. Several attempts on Mallory's proposed route occurred during the 1922 expedition.|$|E
