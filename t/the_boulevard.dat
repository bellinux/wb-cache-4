5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor {{has been supported}} by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business owners, have opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes down the center of <b>the</b> <b>boulevard,</b> which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections.|$|E
5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city. At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. <b>The</b> <b>boulevard</b> ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E

Now, if you choose, you can go out from the Place Vendome on the northern side, by the Street of Peace, and so walk on till you come to <b>the</b> <b>Boulevards.</b> Then you can walk along <b>the</b> <b>Boulevards</b> as far as you please.|$|R
5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above <b>the</b> <b>boulevard.</b> The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, the repair cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard</b> Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E
5|$|Hull City Association Football Club {{was founded}} in June 1904; {{previous}} attempts to found a football club had proved difficult because of the dominance {{in the city of}} rugby league teams such as Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers. The club was unable to apply for membership of the Football League for the 1904–05 season and instead played only in friendlies, the first of which was a 2–2 draw with Notts County on 1 September 1904 with 6,000 in attendance. These early matches were played at <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard,</b> the home of Hull F.C. The club's first competitive football match was in the FA Cup preliminary round, drawing 3–3 with Stockton on 17 September, but they were eliminated after losing the replay 4–1 on 22 September. After disputes with landlords at <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard,</b> Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground. After having played 44friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were finally admitted into the Football League Second Division for the 1905–06 season. Other teams competing in the league that season included the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea, as well as Yorkshire rivals Barnsley, Bradford City and Leeds City. Hull defeated Barnsley 4–1 at home in their first game and finished the season in fifth place.|$|E

Those who dropped out before the race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider {{who went on to}} organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange's first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix because he and two brothers had opened a cycle shop in <b>the</b> <b>boulevard</b> de Paris the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Plans for <b>the</b> <b>boulevard</b> and the {{construction}} of a Michigan Avenue Bridge were further elaborated upon in Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. In 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and {{the construction}} of a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street. An ordinance to fund construction was passed in 1913, but was declared void by the Supreme Court of Illinois. A second ordinance was passed in 1914, but legal battles continued until the end of 1916. Construction finally started on April 15, 1918, and the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony on May 14, 1920.|$|E
5|$|Previously a {{grade-level}} intersection, the underpass {{was constructed}} simultaneously with the subway station costing $250,000. The {{construction of the}} underpass with a subway station underneath was a massive undertaking. Three levels were required {{in order for the}} underpass and the subway station to be built. The upper level that was built was Queens Boulevard, which carries traffic east and west. The second level is an underpass that carries four lanes of Union Turnpike (and now also the Jackie Robinson Parkway) under <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard.</b> The tunnel is in between the two mezzanines and it would rest atop the roof of the subway station platform.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification {{are specific to}} Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks– as Rastignac does continually– takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le Père Goriot: the aristocratic area around <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard</b> Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.|$|E
5|$|The prologue was a {{short and}} fairly flat circuit around Liège, with {{expected}} stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; the riders then headed north by <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard</b> d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point when they returned on the opposite carriageway, before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, {{in front of the}} Palais des Princes-Évêques. From there, the riders rejoined the original route on the opposite carriageway of Boulevard de la Sauvenière before the finish line located on Boulevard d'Avroy {{on the opposite side of}} the Parc d'Avroy from the start.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{entrance}}s and exits. The main station entrance and ventilation building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to shine on the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to <b>the</b> <b>boulevard.</b> At the time of construction, the ventilation building was designed so developers could built on top of it later. The 55 Hudson Yards skyscraper, whose structure is partially atop the ventilation tower, started construction in January 2015, and pictures in May 2016 showed that the skyscraper had so far been constructed to the height of the ventilation tower.|$|E

Le théâtre municipal or Calais Theatre {{is located on}} <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard</b> Lafayette and was built in 1903 on a plot of land which {{was used as a}} cemetery between 1811 and 1871.

5|$|Through {{much of this}} portion, {{the road}} is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line {{both sides of the}} road and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of <b>the</b> <b>Boulevard</b> Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth in the last few years.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in <b>the</b> <b>boulevard</b> Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E

50|$|Line T3 is {{the first}} modern tramway in Paris proper. It {{is divided into two}} {{sections}} called T3a and T3b. The line is also known as the tramway des Maréchaux because it follows <b>the</b> <b>boulevards</b> des maréchaux, a series of boulevards that encircle Paris along the route of the former Thiers Wall (built 1841-44). <b>The</b> <b>boulevards</b> are, with three exceptions, named for Napoleon's First Empire marshals (maréchaux).|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, along <b>the</b> <b>boulevards,</b> <b>the</b> {{contribution}} of the architectural period 1850-1950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and {{the headquarters of the}} municipality of Tunis.|$|R
