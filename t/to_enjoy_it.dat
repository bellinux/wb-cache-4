5|$|In 1719 the Duke and Duchess {{were able}} {{to move into the}} east wing of the {{unfinished}} palace, but Marlborough had only three years <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it.</b> While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in the vault at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side lying in the vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} was {{a continuation}} of the narrative of Path of Radiance, even though that game was not given an intentional cliffhanger ending. So the story would be comprehensible for people who had not played Path of Radiance, the story was split up into four segments divided between the game's various factions. The team initially thought of a three-part structure, then settled on the current format. Their aim from the beginning was to create a large-scale, intricate world for players <b>to</b> <b>enjoy.</b> <b>It</b> {{was the first time the}} developers had incorporated such a structure into a Fire Emblem game. The dialogue for characters was made slightly rougher based on feedback from Path of Radiance, where character dialogue remained calm and cultured even in battle situations. The total number of characters increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to Path of Radiance. So players could keep track of how characters interacted with each other, the team introduced a character relationship flow chart. The game's Japanese subtitle made reference to both a key character and the way Telleus came to be. They also wanted to continue to portray the themes of conflict explored in Path of Radiance. The game's thematic color, expressed in its artwork and presentation, was red, as opposed to the use of blue in Path of Radiance. Senri Kita, the character designer for Path of Radiance, returned in that capacity for Radiant Dawn.|$|E

25|$|Liberace was a {{conservative}} in his politics and faith, eschewing dissidents and rebels. He believed fervently in capitalism {{and was also}} fascinated with royalty, ceremony, and luxury. He loved to hobnob with the rich and famous, acting as starstruck with presidents and kings as his fans behaved with him. Yet to his fans, he was still one of them, a Midwesterner who had earned his success through hard work, and who invited them <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> with him.|$|E

After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E

The Huffington Post remarked that [...] "What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even the weirdest question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humor."

500|$|Directly {{influenced}} by musical theatre, Ashman strongly believed that The Little Mermaid {{would benefit from}} an [...] "I Want" [...] song, a musical number during which the main character sings about what {{she would like to}} accomplish by the end of her story. Directors and writers Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but Ashman felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world instead would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, a stage actress with whom he had first worked on the Broadway musical Smile (1986), to record [...] "Part of Your World", and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg initially ordered that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator Glen Keane ultimately convinced Katzenberg that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> during a subsequent test screening.|$|E
500|$|As {{the years}} went by and the king became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour".

She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it,</b> she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Twain {{remained}} frightened that Foster would {{dislike the}} song or her voice. To qualm her fears, Twain approached the session {{as if she}} were introducing [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] as a songwriter, rather than a singer. Twain and Foster recorded the demo of [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] at Foster's home studio in Los Angeles, California. They created the musical arrangement as the session progressed. Background vocals were provided by Twain and her sister, Carrie Ann Twain, using a handheld microphone. Foster then suggested for Twain to record lead vocals in his home's vocal booth. After agreeing, Twain nervously approached the recording session. Once immersed in the process, she began <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it.</b> The singer considered her session with Foster a [...] "landmark moment in [...] journey" [...] through Why Not? with Shania Twain and described it as second nature, as if she never put her musical career to a halt. Twain later recorded the studio version of [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] and co-produced it along Foster and Nathan Chapman. The song made Twain feel comfortable recording music again, thus she began to work on her forthcoming fifth studio album.|$|E
