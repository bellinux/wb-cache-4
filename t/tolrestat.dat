Low-quality trials and a high incidence of adverse effects (particularly hepatotoxicity) led to termination of its development, and it was never in clinical use.

50|$|The {{treatment}} for galactosemic cataract {{is no different}} from general galactosemia treatment. In fact, galactosemic cataract {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is actually reversible. Infants should be immediately removed from a galactose diet when symptoms present, and the cataract should disappear and visibility should return to normal. Aldose reductase inhibitors, such as sorbinil, have also proven promising in preventing and reversing galactosemic cataracts. AR inhibitors hinder aldose reductase from synthesizing galactitol in the lens, and thus restricts the osmotic swelling of the lens fibers. Other AR inhibitors include the acetic acid compounds zopolrestat, <b>tolrestat,</b> alrestatin, and epalrestat. Many of these compounds have not been successful in clinical trials due to adverse pharmokinetic properties, inadequate efficacy and efficiency, and toxic side effects. Testing on such drug-treatments continues in order to determine potential long-term complications, and for a more detailed mechanism of how AR inhibitors prevent and reverse the galactosemic cataract.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolrestat</b> {{is a well}} tolerated nonhydantoin aldose reductase {{inhibitor}} {{that has}} been reported to improve nerve conduction in diabetic animals and humans. Its effects on nerve biochemistry and structure have not been studied in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Patients with advanced diabetic neuropathy treated with long-term open-label <b>tolrestat</b> were randomly assigned to continuation on drug treatment or to placebo-controlled drug withdrawal for 12 months. At the end of this period, sural nerve biopsies were obtained for measurement of glucose, sorbitol, and fructose content, and for detailed morphometric analysis. <b>Tolrestat</b> ameliorated the glucose-mediated increase in sorbitol and fructose in sural nerve tissue. No statistically significant differences in nerve morphometry emerged between the two groups; however, both treatment groups exhibited increased nerve-fiber regeneration and normalization of axo-glial dysjunction and segmental demyelination following long-term <b>tolrestat</b> treatment. These findings are similar to those previously reported in a placebo-controlled sequential nerve biopsy study with the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil. Thus <b>tolrestat</b> is a biochemically effective aldose reductase inhibitor in human diabetic nerve with potential therapeutic efficacy for diabetic neuropathy...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To update readers on {{research}} being {{conducted with the}} aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) <b>tolrestat</b> in treating complications of diabetes mellitus. The article briefly describes early investigations with other ARIs and reviews the more recent studies of <b>tolrestat.</b> In addition, the article gives readers a simplified overview of the biochemical background pertinent {{to the use of}} these agents. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify articles relating to the clinical use of, and research involving, the following ARIs: sorbinil, airestatin, ponairestat, and <b>tolrestat.</b> In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers were contacted in an attempt to obtain data relating to ongoing investigations. STUDY SELECTION: Review articles and clinical trials of sorbinil, airestatin, and ponalrestat were included. Articles dealing with clinical trials of <b>tolrestat</b> were selected from the MEDLINE search. As {{there were only a few}} trials, all studies identified were included. No additional written data were available from the manufacturers. DATA SYNTHESIS: ARIs, which when first introduced were proclaimed to be major advances in treating diabetic complications, have never produced the expected results. Problems with efficacy and toxicity relegated most of this class of agents to historical interest. One compound, <b>tolrestat,</b> has continued to be tested and has potential clinical application. To date, the extent of benefit that has been realized in tolrestat-treated patients is small to moderate. Improvements have occurred in paresthesia and neuropathy, but unfortunately, not in pain symptoms. Adverse effects have been minor and are primarily confmed to elevations of hepatic alanine aminotransferase. Additional clinical trials are being conducted with this agent. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Tolrestat</b> is the only one of the original ARIs still undergoing clinical trials. Results so far have been encouraging, but by no means defmitive, for improvement in some aspects of diabetic neuropathy. Information from ongoing investigations is necessary before the true usefulness of <b>tolrestat</b> therapy can be determined...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Aldose reductase (AR) is an NADPH-dependent enzyme {{implicated in}} {{long-term}} diabetic complications. Buried {{at the bottom}} of a deep hydrophobic cleft, the NADPH coenzyme is surrounded by the conserved hydrophilic residues of the AR active site. The existence of an anionic binding site near the NADP+ has been determined from the structures of the complexes of AR with citrate, cacodylate and glucose- 6 -phosphate. The inhibitor zopolrestat binds to this anionic site, and in the hydrophobic cleft, after a change of conformation which opens a ‘specificity’ pocket. Results: The crystal structures of the porcine AR holoenzyme and its complexes with the inhibitors <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil have been solved; these structures are important as <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil are, pharmaceutically, the most well-studied AR inhibitors. The active site of the holoenzyme was analyzed, and binding of the inhibitors was found to involve two contact zones in the active site: first, a recognition region for hydrogen-bond acceptors near the coenzyme, with three centers, including the anionic site; and second, a hydrophobic contact zone in the active-site cleft, which in the case of <b>tolrestat</b> includes the specificity pocket. The conformational change leading to the opening of the specificity pocket upon <b>tolrestat</b> binding is different to the one seen upon zopolrestat binding; this pocket binds inhibitors that are more effective against AR than against aldehyde reductase. Conclusions: The active site of AR adapts itself to bind tightly to different inhibitors; this happens both upon binding to the inhibitor's hydrophilic heads, and at the hydrophobic and specificity pockets of AR, which can change their shape through different conformational changes of the same residues. This flexibility could explain the large variety of possible substrates of AR...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} whether {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) alteration in erythrocytes from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is responsible for the impaired glutathione (GSH) redox status, and to assess if short-term inhibition of the polyol pathway normalizes NADPH levels and GSH redox status via an amelioration of the NADPH/total NADP (tNADP) ratio. For this purpose, erythrocyte NADPH and GSH levels were measured in 18 NIDDM patients at baseline and then after 1 week of random double-blind assignment to treatment with either <b>tolrestat</b> (an aldose reductase inhibitor, 200 mg daily) (n = 12) or placebo (n = 6), A group of 16 healthy volunteers served as the control, In the basal condition, mean GSH (P <. 0001) and NADPH (P <. 0001) levels and NADPH/tNADP (P <. 0001) and GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) (P <. 005) ratios were lower in NIDDM patients than in control subjects. <b>Tolrestat</b> treatment increased GSH levels (P <. 05 v placebo and baseline) and the NADPH/tNADP ratio (P <. 05 v placebo and baseline). Interestingly, tolrestat-induced changes in GSH and NADPH levels and in GSH/GSSG and NADPH/tNADP ratios were significant only in patients who showed a decreased NADPH/tNADP ratio at baseline (n = 8). In these latter patients, we also found a direct correlation between percentage increments in GSH levels and NADPH/tNADP ratios after <b>tolrestat</b> treatment (r =. 71, P <. 05). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that polyol pathway activation decreases NADPH and GSH levels. Accordingly, short-term inhibition of this enzymatic route increased both the GSH level and the NADPH/tNADP ratio. These changes were observable only in the subgroup of patients with an abnormal NADPH/tNADP ratio at baseline. Polyol pathway inhibition could be useful for decreasing oxidative stress in NIDDM.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{examined}} the role of aldose reductase (AR) in regulating the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Inhibition of AR by sorbinil or <b>tolrestat</b> prevented TNF-α-induced increase in Bax and Bak and the downregulation of Bcl- 2. Inhibition of AR abrogated AP- 1 DNA binding activity and prevented the activation of caspase- 3, JNK, and p 38 MAPK in cells stimulated by TNF-α. Exposure to TNF-α also induced apoptotic cell death, which was attenuated by AR inhibition or antisense ablation.

Each compound was evaluated as a diastereomeric mixture, due to tautomeric equilibria in solution. The parent compound 39 exhibited a good inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 0. 85 μM, {{similar to that}} of the well-known ARI sorbinil (IC 50 0. 50 μM). The concurrent introduction of a halogen and a lipophilic group in the 5 - and in the 1 -positions, respectively, of the indole nucleus of 39, gave compound 55, cyano[5 -fluoro- 1 -(4 -methylbenzyl) - 2 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydroindol- 3 -yl] acetic acid, which displayed the highest activity (IC 50 0. 075 μM, very close to that of <b>tolrestat</b> IC 50 0. 046 μM), with a good selectivity toward ALR 2 compared with aldehyde reductase (ALR 1) (16. 4 -fold), and no appreciable inhibitory properties against sorbitol dehydrogenase (SD), or glutathione reductase (GR). The isopropyl ester 59, a prodrug of 55, was found to be almost as effective as <b>tolrestat</b> in preventing cataract development in severely galactosemic rats when administered as an eye drop solution. Docking simulation of 55 into a three-dimensional model of human ALR 2 made it possible to formulate the hypothesis that the 2 -hydroxy tautomer was the active species binding into the catalytic site of the enzyme.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{meta-analysis}} was {{to review}} the existent evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>tolrestat</b> in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient data on 738 subjects from the three randomized clinical trials published on this topic were analyzed using changes in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) as endpoints. Nerves investigated included median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal. RESULTS: The pooled analysis of NCV taken as a continuous measurement showed a significant treatment effect, the magnitude of this benefit being approximately equal to 1 m/s for all the nerves investigated. When looking at the proportion of patients experiencing a loss of NCV of at least 1 or 2 m/s in at least two out of the four nerves investigated, it emerged that treatment reduced by > 40 % the risk of such outcomes after adjusting for patients' characteristics. The odds ratios relative to the placebo group were 1. 82 (1. 30 - 2. 52) and 1. 70 (1. 15 - 2. 48) for a decrease of 1 and 2 m/s, that is, placebo-treated patients have an 82 and 70 % increased risk for a loss of nerve function of 1 and 2 m/s, respectively. No statistically significant difference in treatment effect emerged after stratification according to baseline motor NCV and glycated hemoglobin levels. CONCLUSIONS: After a treatment duration ranging between 24 - 52 weeks, patients treated with <b>tolrestat</b> had a reduced risk for developing nerve function loss compared with placebo-treated patients. Future long-term trials are needed to evaluate the impact of the treatment on more clinically meaningful endpoints such as the development of foot complications...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe crystal {{structure}} of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, has been determined to 1. 43 angstroms and 0. 95 angstroms resolution. The ternary complex of inhibitor, cofactor and enzyme has been obtained by soaking of preformed crystals. Supposedly due to low solubility in the crystallisation buffer, in both structures the inhibitor shows reduced occupancy of 74 % and 46 % population, respectively. The pyridazinone head group of the inhibitor occupies the catalytic site, whereas the chloro-benzofuran moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high-resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state, whereas the neighbouring His 110 residue most likely adopts a neutral uncharged status. Since the latter structure is populated by the ligand to only 46 %, a second conformation of the C-terminal ligand-binding region can be detected. This conformation corresponds to the closed state of the specificity pocket when no or only small ligands are bound to aldose reductase. The two conformational states are in good agreement with frames observed along a molecular dynamics trajectory describing the transition from closed to open situation. Accordingly, both geometries, superimposed in the averaged {{crystal structure}}, correspond to snapshots of the ligand-bound and the unbound state. Isothermal titration calorimetry {{has been applied to}} determine the binding constants of the investigated pyridazinone in comparison to the hydantoin sorbinil and the carboxylate-type inhibitors IDD 594 and <b>tolrestat.</b> The pyridazinone exhibits a binding affinity similar to those of <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil, and shows slightly reduced affinity compared to IDD 594.

40|$|Diabetic {{patients}} {{undergo a}} chronic oxidative stress. This phenomenon {{is demonstrated by}} low levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. The NADPH used by glutathione reductase for the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH is also used by aldose reductase for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol through the polyol pathway. The competition for NADPH could {{be responsible for the}} decreased glutathione levels found in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of polyol pathway inhibition on the glutathione redox status in these patients. We measured GSH and GSSG levels in erythrocytes of non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (n = 15) before and after 1 week of treatment with placebo, followed by 1 week of treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor (<b>tolrestat</b> 200 mg/dl). We found lower GSH levels (7. 7 +/- 1. 4 mumol/g hemoglobin [Hb]), higher GSSG levels (0. 35 +/- 0. 09 mumol/g Hb), and lower GSH/GSSG ratios (23. 9 +/- 7. 7) in diabetics compared with controls (n = 15; 9. 8 +/- 0. 8 mumol/g Hb, P <. 001; 0. 17 +/- 0. 02, P <. 001; and 58. 3 +/- 9. 1, P <. 001, respectively). We did not demonstrate any statistical difference after 1 week of treatment with placebo. In contrast, the treatment with <b>tolrestat</b> induced a significant increase in GSH (8. 9 +/- 0. 7 mumol/g Hb, P <. 01), a decrease in GSSG (0. 25 +/- 0. 06 mumol/g Hb, P <. 02), and an increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio (37. 3 +/- 8. 4, P <. 01).

40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} of glucose action on angiotensinogen gene expression in rat proximal tubular cells. BackgroundClinical {{studies have shown}} that the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor antagonists decrease proteinuria and slow the progression of nephropathy in diabetes, indicating that Ang II plays an important role in the development of nephropathy. We have previously reported that high levels of glucose stimulate the expression of rat angiotensinogen (ANG) gene in opossum kidney (OK) proximal tubular cells. We hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of d(+) -glucose on the expression of the ANG gene in kidney proximal tubular cells is mediated via de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) and the protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathway. MethodsImmortalized rat proximal tubular cells (IRPTCs) were cultured in monolayer. The stimulatory effect of glucose on the activation of polyol pathway and PKC signal transduction pathway in IRPTCs was determined. The immunoreactive rat ANG (IR-rANG) in the culture medium and the cellular ANG mRNA were measured with a specific radioimmunoassay and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, respectively. Resultsd(+) -glucose (25 mm) markedly increased the intracellular levels of sorbitol, fructose, DAG, and PKC activity as well as the expression of IR-rANG and ANG mRNA in IRPTCs. These stimulatory effects of d(+) -glucose (25 mm) were blocked by an inhibitor of aldose reductase, <b>Tolrestat.</b> PKC inhibitors also inhibited the stimulatory effect of d(+) -glucose (25 mm) on the expression of the IR-rANG in IRPTCs. The addition of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate further enhanced the stimulatory effect of d(+) -glucose (25 mm) on the expression of the IR-rANG in IRPTCs and blocked the inhibitory effect of <b>Tolrestat.</b> ConclusionThese studies suggest that the stimulatory effect of a high level of d(+) -glucose (25 mm) on the expression of the ANG gene in IRPTCs is mediated, at least in part, via the de novo synthesis of DAG, an activator of PKC signal transduction pathway...|$|E

To probe the contribution of this pathway, we examined whether inhibition of aldose reductase, which catalyzes the first step of the pathway, affects hyperglyce-mia-induced activation of the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF) -B. Treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells with the aldose reductase inhibitors <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil prevented high-glucose–induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation, nuclear translocation of NF-B, phosphorylation of IKK, and the increase in the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) - 1, and aldose reductase. High-glucose–induced NF-B activation was also prevented by the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine and calphostin C.

40|$|Abstract—Lipid peroxidation {{represents}} a {{significant source of}} erythrocyte dysfunction and aging. Because the toxicity of lipid peroxidation appears to be in part due to aldehydic end products, we examined, in rat erythrocytes, the metabolism of 4 -hydroxy-trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE), one of the most abundant and toxic lipid-derived aldehydes. Packed erythrocytes, 0. 1 ml, completely metabolized 20 nmoles of HNE in 20 min. The glutathione conjugate of HNE and 4 -hydroxynonanoic acid (HNA) represented 70 and 25 % of the total metabolism, respectively. Approximately 70 % of the metabolites were extruded to the medium. Upon electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the glutathione conjugate resolved into two distinct species corresponding to glutathionyl HNE (GS-HNE) and glutathionyl 1, 4 dihydroxynonene (GS-DHN). The concentration of GS-DHN formed was twice that of GS-HNE. Inhibition of aldose reductase by sorbinil and <b>tolrestat</b> led to a selective decrease in the formation of GS-DHN, although the extent of HNE glutathiolation was unaffected. Inhibitors of aldehyde or alcohol dehydrogenase, i. e., cyanamide and 4 -methyl pyrazole, had no effect on the formation of HNA and GS-DHN, indicating that these enzymes are not significant participants in the erythrocyte HNE metabolism.

The resulting mutational constructs of ALR 2 (eight point mutations and one double mutant) were probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by X-ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding properties of these mutants were evaluated using a ligand set of zopolrestat, a related uracil derivative, IDD 388, IDD 393, sorbinil, fidarestat and <b>tolrestat.</b> Our study revealed induced-fit adaptations within the mutated binding site as an essential prerequisite for ligand accommodation related to the selectivity discrimination of the ligands. However, our study also highlights the limits of the present understanding of protein-ligand interactions. Interestingly, binding site mutations not involved in any direct interaction to the ligands in various cases show significant effects towards their binding thermodynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest the binding site residues deviating between ALR 1 and ALR 2 influence ligand affinity in a complex interplay, presumably involving changes of dynamic properties and differences of the solvation/desolvation balance upon ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Atherosclerotic lesion {{formation}} {{is associated with}} the accumulation of oxidized lipids. Products of lipid oxidation, particularly aldehydes, stimulate cytokine production and enhance monocyte adhesion; however, their contribution to atherosclerotic lesion formation remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that inhibition of aldehyde removal by aldose reductase (AR), which metabolizes both free and phospholipid aldehydes, exacerbates atherosclerotic lesion formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In atherosclerotic lesions of apolipoprotein (apo) E-null mice, AR protein was located in macrophage-rich regions and its abundance increased with lesion progression. Treatment of apoE-null mice with AR inhibitors sorbinil or <b>tolrestat</b> increased early lesion formation but did not affect the formation of advanced lesions. Early lesions of AR(-/-) /apoE(-/-) mice maintained on high-fat diet were significantly larger when compared with age-matched AR(+/+) /apoE(-/-) mice. The increase in lesion area attributable to deletion of the AR gene was seen in both male and female mice. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of AR also increased the lesion formation in male mice made diabetic by streptozotocin treatment. Lesions in AR(-/-) /apoE(-/-) mice exhibited increased collagen and macrophage content and a decrease in smooth muscle cells. AR(-/-) /apoE(-/-) mice displayed a greater accumulation of the AR substrate 4 -hydroxy trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) in the plasma and protein-HNE adducts in arterial lesions than AR(+/+) /apoE(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that AR is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and it protects against early stages of atherogenesis by removing toxic aldehydes generated in oxidized lipids. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{mechanism}} of impaired platelet-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in diabetes. Exposure of human platelets to high glucose in vivo or in vitro impairs their ability to cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation. While previous data suggest that the mechanism for this involves increased activity of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, the signal transduction pathway mediating this effect is unknown. Platelets from diabetic patients as well as normal platelets and normal platelets exposed to high glucose concentrations were used to determine the role of the polyol pathway, diacylglycerol (DAG) production, protein kinase C (PKC) activity and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity on vasodilation in rabbit carotid arteries. We found that two aldose-reductase inhibitors, <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil, caused only a modest improvement in the impairment of vasodilation by glucose exposed platelets. However, sorbitol and fructose could not be detected in the platelets, at either normal or hyperglycaemic conditions. We found that incubation in 17 [*]mM glucose caused a significant increase in DAG levels in platelets. Furthermore, the DAG analog 1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) caused significant impairment of platelet-mediated vasodilation. The PKC inhibitors calphostin C and H 7 as well as inhibitors of PLA 2 activity normalized the ability of platelets from diabetic patients to cause vasodilation and prevented glucose-induced impairment of platelet-mediated vasodilation in vitro. These results suggest that the impairment of platelet-mediated vasodilation caused by high glucose concentrations is mediated by increased DAG levels and stimulation of PKC and PLA 2 activity...|$|E
40|$|Localization of aldose and {{aldehyde}} reductase in the kidney. The {{distribution of}} NADPH-dependent reductase {{activity in the}} rat cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla was investigated through biochemical and histochemical methods. Biochemical studies revealed reductase activity {{to be present in}} all three regions of the kidney with the highest specific activity observed in the inner medulla, followed by the cortex and the outer medulla. Activity in all three regions was inhibited by the aldose reductase inhibitors sorbinil, <b>tolrestat</b> and 7 -hydroxychromone- 2 -carboxylic acid. Based on substrate utilization and response to sulfate ion and inhibitors, the inner medulla contains primarily aldose reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 21) while the cortex contains primarily aldehyde reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 2). The outer medulla contains a mixture of both enzymes. This distribution was confirmed by a radioimmunoassay for aldose reductase. Immunohistochemical investigations of the rat kidney with antibodies against rat lens aldose reductase and rat kidney aldehyde reductase revealed a similar distribution of these enzymes. Aldehyde reductase was immunohistochemically detected only in the cortex where it was localized in the proximal convoluted tubules. Immunoreactive aldose reductase was detected in Henle's loop at both the inner stripe of the outer medulla and in the inner medulla, and in the collecting tubules and the epithelial cell lining the pelvis of the inner medulla near the papilla. No specific immunohistochemical staining for aldose reductase was observed in the cortex. A similar immunohistochemical distribution of aldose reductase was also observed in the human kidney with antibodies against human placental aldose reductase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Abnormal {{proliferation}} of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) {{is an important}} feature of atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. Although multiple mediators of VSMC growth have been identified, few effective pharmacological tools {{have been developed to}} limit such growth. Recent evidence indicating an important role for oxidative stress in cell growth led us to investigate the potential role of aldose reductase (AR) in the {{proliferation of}} VSMCs. Because AR catalyzes the reduction of mitogenic aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that it might be a potential regulator of redox changes that accompany VSMC growth. Herein we report several lines of evidence suggesting that AR facilitates/mediates VSMC growth. Stimulation of human aortic SMCs in culture with mitogenic concentrations of serum, thrombin, basic fibroblast growth factor, and the lipid peroxidation product 4 -hydroxy-trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) led to a 2 - to 4 -fold increase in the steady-state levels of AR mRNA, a 4 - to 7 -fold increase in AR protein, and a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in its catalytic activity. Inhibition of the enzyme by sorbinil or <b>tolrestat</b> diminished mitogen-induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In parallel experiments, the extent of reduction of the glutathione conjugate of HNE to glutathionyl- 1, 4 -dihydroxynonene in HNE-exposed VSMCs was decreased by serum starvation or sorbinil. Immunohistochemical staining of cross sections from balloon-injured rat carotid arteries showed increased expression of AR protein associated with the neointima. The media of injured or uninjured arteries demonstrated no significant staining. Compared with untreated animals, rats fed sorbinil (40 mg � kg � 1 � d � 1) displaye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Aldose reductase (AR), {{a member}} of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, has been shown to metabolize toxic {{aldehydes}} generated by lipid peroxidation, suggesting that it may serve as an antioxidant defense. To investigate its role in the late phase of ischemic preconditioning (PC), conscious rabbits underwent 6 cycles of 4 -minute coronary occlusion/ 4 -minute reperfusion. Twenty-four hours later, there was a marked increase in AR protein and activity and in the myocardial content of sorbitol, a unique product of AR catalysis. Pretreatment with N�-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, or chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor (both given at doses that block late PC in this model), prevented the increase in AR protein 24 hours later, demonstrating that ischemic PC upregulates AR via nitric oxide – and protein kinase C–dependent signaling pathways. The AR-selective inhibitors <b>tolrestat</b> and sorbinil prevented AR-mediated accumulation of sorbitol and abrogated the infarct-sparing effect of late PC, demonstrating that enhanced AR activity is necessary for this cardioprotective phenomenon to occur. Inhibition of AR did not affect infarct size or the myocardial accumulation of the lipid peroxidation product 4 -hydroxy trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) in nonpreconditioned rabbits. The accumulation of HNE was inhibited by late PC, and this effect was abrogated by sorbinil. Taken together, these results establish AR as an essential mediator of late PC. Furthermore, the data suggest that myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury {{is due in part to}} the generation of lipid peroxidation products and that late PC diminishes this source of injury by upregulating AR.

40|$|AKR 1 B 10 {{is a human}} aldo-keto reductase (AKR) {{found to}} be {{elevated}} in several cancer types and in precancerous lesions. In vitro, AKR 1 B 10 exhibits a much higher retinaldehyde reductase activity than any other human AKR, including AKR 1 B 1 (aldose reductase). We here demonstrate that AKR 1 B 10 also acts as a retinaldehyde reductase in vivo. This activity may be relevant in controlling {{the first step of}} retinoic acid synthesis. Up-regulation of AKR 1 B 10, resulting in retinoic acid depletion, may lead to cellular proliferation. Both in vitro and in vivo activities of AKR 1 B 10 were inhibited by <b>tolrestat,</b> an AKR 1 B 1 inhibitor developed for diabetes treatment. The crystal structure of the ternary complex AKR 1 B 10 -NADP+-tolrestat was determined at 1. 25 -Å resolution. Molecular dynamics models of AKR 1 B 10 and AKR 1 B 1 with retinaldehyde isomers and site-directed mutagenesis show that subtle differences at the entrance of the retinoid-binding site, especially at position 125, are determinant for the all-trans-retinaldehyde specificity of AKR 1 B 10. Substitutions in the retinaldehyde cyclohexene ring also influence the specificity. These structural features should facilitate the design of specific inhibitors, with potential use in cancer and diabetes treatments. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

40|$|Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes the {{reduction}} of several aldehydes ranging from lipid peroxidation products to glucose. The activity of AR is increased in the ischemic heart due to oxidation of its cysteine residues, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To examine signaling mechanisms regulating AR activation, we studied the role of nitric oxide (NO). Treatment with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester prevented ischemia-induced AR activation and myocardial sorbitol accumulation in rat hearts subjected to global ischemia ex vivo or coronary ligation in situ, whereas inhibition of inducible NOS and neuronal NOS had no effect. Activation of AR in the ischemic heart was abolished by pretreatment with peroxynitrite scavengers hesperetin or 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis-[4 -sulfonatophenyl]-porphyrinato-iron [III]. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses showed that Cys- 298 of AR was readily oxidized to sulfenic acid by peroxynitrite. Treatment with bradykinin and insulin led to a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -dependent increase in the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS at Ser- 1177 and, {{even in the absence}} of ischemia, was sufficient in activating AR. Activation of AR by bradykinin and insulin was reversed upon reduction with dithiothreitol or by inhibiting NOS or PI 3 K. Treatment with AR inhibitors sorbinil or <b>tolrestat</b> reduced post-ischemic recovery in the rat hearts subjected to global ischemia and increased the infarct size when given before ischemia or upon reperfusion. These results suggest that AR is a cardioprotective protein and that its activation in the ischemic heart is due to peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of Cys- 298 to sulfenic acid via the PI 3 K/Akt/endothelial NOS pathway...|$|E
40|$|Aldose reductase is a rate {{limiting}} enzyme in the polyol pathway asso ciated with the conversion of glucose to sorbitol. The enzyme {{is located in the}} eye (cornea, retina, lens), kidney, myelin sheath, and also in other tissues less involved in diabetic complications. Experiments in diabetic animals have implicated sorbitol accumulation in the lens to the develop m ent of cataracts. The use of inhibitors of aldose reductase in animal stud ies has dem onstrated tha t d iabetic com plications such as cataracts, nephropathy, and slowing of nerve conduction can be ameliorated. W hile an osmotic effect can explain the physical changes in the lens leading to cataract formation, the effect of sorbitol accumulation in other tissues and the resulting diabetic complications has been linked to the depletion of m yoinositol content resulting in a derangem ent of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity. Since glucose and other hexoses are poor substrates for aldose reductase, it is only in hyperglycemia when the enzyme hexokinase is saturated that aldose reductase is activated, leading to accumulation of sorbitol. The kinetics of inhibition of aldose reductase by a variety of inhibitors has been delineated. The dose required varies from inhibitor to inhibitor and is consistent with their inhibition constants. Toxicity is a consideration in the use of some of the inhibitors, as was demonstrated with sorbinil which caused hypersensitivity reactions in 10 percent of patients. O ther inhibitors such as <b>tolrestat</b> have shown efficacy and are under clinical investigation. Interpretation of results obtained with aldose reductase inhibitor therapy in human subjects suggest that these inhibitors are effective at early stages of diabetic complications...|$|E
40|$|Human aldose reductase (ALR 2) {{has evolved}} as a {{promising}} therapeutic {{target for the}} treatment of diabetic long-term complications. The binding site of this enzyme possesses two main subpockets: the catalytic anion-binding site and the hydrophobic specificity pocket. The latter can be observed in the open or closed state, depending on the bound ligand. Thus, it exhibits a pronounced capability for induced-fit adaptations, whereas the catalytic pocket exhibits rigid properties throughout all known crystal structures. Here, we determined two ALR 2 crystal structures at 1. 55 and 1. 65 A resolution, each complexed with an inhibitor of the recently described naphtho[1, 2 -d]isothiazole acetic acid series. In contrast to the original design hypothesis based on the binding mode of <b>tolrestat</b> (1), both inhibitors leave the specificity pocket in the closed state. Unexpectedly, the more potent ligand (2) extends the catalytic pocket by opening a novel subpocket. Access to this novel subpocket is mainly attributed to the rotation of an indole moiety of Trp 20 by about 35 degrees. The newly formed subpocket provides accommodation of the naphthyl portion of the ligand. The second inhibitor, 3, differs from 2 only by an extended glycolic ester functionality added to one of its carboxylic groups. However, despite this slight structural modification, the binding mode of 3 differs dramatically from that of the first inhibitor, but provokes less pronounced induced-fit adaptations of the binding cavity. Thus, a novel binding site conformation has been identified in a region where previous complex structures suggested only low adaptability of the binding pocket. Furthermore, the two ligand complexes represent an impressive example of how the slight change of a chemically extended side-chain at a given ligand scaffold can result in a dramatically altered binding mode. In addition, our study emphasizes the importance of crystal structure analysis for the translation of affinity data into structure-activity relationships...|$|E
