25|$|Historically, the Druze in Lebanon {{managed to}} {{maintain}} for centuries a small, hardy {{community in the}} Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut surrounded by a sea of potential enemies, both Christian and Muslim, {{and they have a}} reputation of being savage fighters known for their tenacious battle spirit. Their esprit de corps and brutal methods often convinced their opponents to flee, whilst those who decided to stay and fight never lived to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale.</b> However, the Lebanese Druze have also been amiable to whoever controls the Chouf region at any given time, and they were pragmatic with their dealings with foreign powers such as the Israelis, Americans and Syrians.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} of the novel, Books 3–5, tells how Dick rescues Joanna from Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow {{fellowship}} and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback, the future Richard III of England. It centres on Shoreby, where the Lancastrian forces are entrenched. Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of Book 3, wherein Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna.

25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale</b> remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Achebe's fiction draws {{heavily on the}} oral {{tradition}} of the Igbo people. He weaves folk tales {{into the fabric of}} his stories, illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling. The tale about the Earth and Sky in Things Fall Apart, for example, emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>tale,</b> Okonkwo's dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance. Later, Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such [...] "women's stories".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, García Márquez was {{diagnosed}} with lymphatic cancer. Chemotherapy provided by a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful, and the illness went into remission. This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs: [...] "I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum, disconnected the telephone, canceled the trips {{and all sorts of}} current and future plans", he told El Tiempo, the Colombian newspaper, [...] "...and locked myself in to write every day without interruption."

500|$|Moore and Gibbons {{designed}} Watchmen {{to showcase}} the unique {{qualities of the}} comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths. In a 1986 interview, Moore said, [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] So really the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen.

[...] However, there is also speculation that García Márquez took inspiration from his experience of unemployment in 1956 after the newspaper he had been working for shut down.
