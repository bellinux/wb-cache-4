5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a quartet. Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their {{longtime}} recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Claudius, much public outrage ensued, {{and there was a}} clear desire in the general public that Halotus and several other {{suspects}} (such as Tigellinus, another servant who served Claudius), be executed. Nero, who acceded to the throne, allowed Halotus <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> chief steward and taster; Halotus served Nero until the latter's death in 68, and Galba's assumption of the throne.|$|E

5|$|He {{suffered}} a broken nose following Daniel Sturridge elbowing {{him in the}} face in the following game, and subsequently missed the FA Cup semi-final. However, he recovered to play four further Premier League matches. Portsmouth were relegated in 20th position {{at the end of the}} season, having been deducted nine points for entering into administration. Despite uncertainty over whether the club would be able <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name four of their permitted seven substitutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the 3rd Duke {{attempted}} {{to have the}} Wotton Tramway recognised as a railway, and William Yolland inspected the line in April 1873. The Railway Regulation Act 1844 defined minimum standards of travel, {{one of which was}} that the trains travel at an average of , which the Aveling and Porter locomotives could not manage. None of the stopping places had adequate station buildings, and the line had no signals. Yolland permitted the line <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a tramway, but refused to recognise it as a railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} Royal Commission's report {{about to be}} published, the GNP {{returned}} to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 proposal for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with Strand station. The second proposed an extension and relocation of Strand station to the junction of Strand and Surrey Street. From there the line was <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a single tunnel under the River Thames to Waterloo. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only the relocation of Strand station was permitted.|$|E

At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> <b>as</b> he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was a {{supporter}} of the White Australia Policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election.It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You Going to Do with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E

5|$|When Lord Melbourne loses {{a vote in}} Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, {{wishes to}} replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with {{supporters}} {{of his own party}} and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|While the Command {{retained}} a minimum peacetime {{force and the}} Air Ministry had every intention of maintaining it as such, the fleet was further reduced and suffered from procurement problems. The Short Shetland and Short Seaford were rejected as replacements for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. A maritime version of the promising Avro Lincoln {{had yet to be}} ordered by the time the Lend-Lease programme ended in August 1945. The Short Sunderland was forced <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> the main operational type until the end of 1946. Most of the aircraft that operated in the command were the Second World War types; the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Beaufighter.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion—her department was responsible for abortion services funded through Medicaid. Mansour refused to make such a statement, and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E

5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered Buenos Aires. The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires did not allow his return to Buenos Aires and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of Buenos Aires, including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She and Bradley selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City Ballet declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E
