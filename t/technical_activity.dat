In 1958, a CQ editorial opined that if ham radio lost status as a <b>technical</b> <b>activity,</b> it might also lose the privilege of operating on the public airwaves, saying, ‘‘As our ranks of home constructors thin we also fall to a lower technical level as a group’’.|$|E

50|$|The sport {{originated}} in Northern Europe and Eastern Europe {{in the late}} 1950s. Amateur radio was widely promoted in the schools of Northern and Eastern Europe as a modern scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>activity.</b> Most medium to large cities hosted one or more amateur radio clubs at which members could congregate and learn about the technology and operation of radio equipment. One of the activities that schools and radio clubs promoted was radio direction finding, an activity that had important civil defense applications during the Cold War. As few individuals in Europe had personal automobiles at the time, most of this radio direction finding activity took place on foot, in parks, natural areas, or school campuses. The sport of orienteering, popular in its native Scandinavia, had begun to spread {{to more and more}} countries throughout Europe, including the nations of the Eastern Bloc. As orienteering became more popular and orienteering maps became more widely available, it was only natural to combine the two activities and hold radio direction finding events on orienteering maps.|$|E

Firstly, we briefly present <b>technical</b> <b>activity</b> days, the goals and criteria for the planning of technical days, and the topics and devices connected to the technical day in question and were needed in the execution of the experiments. We have selected four simple experiments in the field of solar energy and prepared the needed worksheets for the students. The experiments selected are: solar oven, sun collector, greenhouse and solar cells. Following the theoretical part we provide a review of the topics covered by the current curriculum, which are connected to the topic of the technical day. The practical part presents the details of planning, preparation and the execution of the <b>technical</b> <b>activity</b> day in grades 7 and 9. The answers given by the students to the questions on the worksheets were compared with the expected answers. Thus we gained an insight based on the quantities and observations measured by the students into the way they make deductions about the experiment.
