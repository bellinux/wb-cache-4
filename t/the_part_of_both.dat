5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{indifferent}} form on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Forster and Southampton as a whole, Southampton {{became the}} first team in history to reach the League Cup final without conceding a single goal. However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had a good match in Southampton's scoreless draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.|$|E
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were {{exceptions to this}} (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), {{it was not until}} after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} played during the Cold War, and intense {{feelings}} of nationalism were aroused in both Canada and the Soviet Union, {{as well as}} on the ice. The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America, such as Alexander Yakushev, Valeri Kharlamov and goaltender Vladislav Tretiak; the latter two are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. Team Canada, the first NHL and professional all-star team formed for international play, was led by Phil Esposito, who led the series in scoring, as well as contributing in other roles. The Canadian line of Bobby Clarke, Ron Ellis and Henderson, which was not expected to start for the team, as none were yet stars, played a surprisingly large role in the Canadian win. The series was filled with controversy, starting with the exclusion of top Canadian player Bobby Hull and including disputes over officiating, dirty play on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> teams and the deliberate injury of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traffic {{congestion}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of lost productivity and decreased standard of living in urban settings. In previous work published at AAMAS, we have proposed a novel reservation-based mechanism for increasing throughput and decreasing delays at intersections [3]. In more recent work, we have provided a detailed protocol by which two different classes of agents (intersection managers and driver agents) can use this system [4]. We believe that the domain created by this mechanism and protocol presents many opportunities for multiagent learning on <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> classes <b>of</b> agents. In this paper, we identify several of these opportunities and offer a first-cut approach to each. ...|$|R

25|$|Music was an {{integral}} part of Nowell's upbringing on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> of his parents. His father, a construction worker, enjoyed playing guitar and exposed him to the music of Jim Croce; his mother taught piano for a living in addition to playing the flute. Both parents helped teach young Nowell to play the guitar. In the summer of 1979, eleven-year-old Nowell accompanied his father on a month-long sailing trip in the Virgin Islands, where he was first exposed to reggae music.|$|E

Self-immolations, on the other hand, result in dramatic images of the protester while burning or afterwards which can be easily transmitted over the internet to news media and supporters.

40|$|Commentators {{regularly}} {{call for}} the globalization of U. S. legal education. An often unstated presumption {{is that if we}} build global law schools, students will come. In the imaginations of its promoters, the global law school will be overwhelmed by demand from students motivated by economically defined career goals. This perspective neglects the potentially confounding influences of imperfect information, on <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> employers and students, as well as social and cultural factors that influence students’ decision-making. This study examines factors that influence student decisions about whether to participate in one aspect of globally oriented legal education, study abroad programs, drawing on recent experience with a study abroad program at NYU School of Law...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{articles}} on dualism are discussed. Following the chronological {{order of their}} publication, {{the first one is}} Julie Nelson?s (1992) article ?Gender, Metaphor, and the Definition of Economics? and the second one is ??Order out of Chaos? in Economics??, by Victoria Chick (1995). After <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> articles that are used for comparison are summarized, it is argued that the frameworks by Nelson and Chick are compatible. This approach supports the thesis that both authors essentially have the same point of view. The paper concludes by investigating the line of thought that emerges from the two articles and projecting this line into a suggested agenda for future research. ...|$|R

This combination resulted in an involuntary error on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> ATC and aircraft that could not be corrected by the time the air traffic controller realised that his instructions to the aircraft's crew were given in response to a mutual misunderstanding, which resulted from a navigational error on the crew's part that had gone unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was {{an ambitious}} attempt on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> London and Berlin to reach better relations, but it {{ultimately}} floundered because of conflicting expectations {{between the two}} states. For the Germans, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was intended to {{mark the beginning of}} an Anglo-German alliance against France and the Soviet Union, whereas for the British, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was to {{be the beginning of a}} series of arms limitation agreements that were made to limit German expansionism. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was highly controversial, both at the time and since, because the 35:100 tonnage ratio allowed Germany the right to build a Navy beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles, and the British had made the agreement without consulting France or Italy.|$|E
