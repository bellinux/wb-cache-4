5|$|In Philadelphia, Thompson gains {{employment}} {{as a high}} school gym coach, while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U-Foes, who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in Venom #30, to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin. Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him when that happens. Venom #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed. It is revealed that Mania's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way's 2003 Venom series. The symbiote expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking <b>the</b> <b>brands</b> for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote, not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had {{always wanted to be a}} dad, and that he will now take responsibility for Mania.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MComm (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Any brand has a {{specific}} identity {{that the company}} wants to portray to consumers in its target market – its brand identity – what <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> stands for. This {{is also the case}} for Oakley, a luxury <b>brand</b> competing in <b>the</b> sports and fashion industries. In essence <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> identity of a company is that what <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> is characterised by and what it stands for in the minds of consumers. By communicating its brand identity to consumers, a company create associations with <b>the</b> <b>brand,</b> which in turn forms <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> image that consumers have of <b>the</b> <b>brand.</b> <b>The</b> greater the degree to which consumers associate <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> with those characteristics that <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> in effect stands for, the greater <b>the</b> congruence between <b>brand</b> image and <b>brand</b> identity. <b>The</b> aim for a company is to realise a <b>brand</b> image in <b>the</b> minds of consumers that is similar, if not the same as <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> identity that it has identified for itself. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> identity of Oakley is identified and <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> image that consumers have of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> examined. <b>The</b> two concepts are then compared to find out to what degree the two are related and whether Oakley has in fact managed to portray their brand identity accurately (as reflected through <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> image). <b>The</b> relationship between price and quality for a <b>brand</b> represents <b>the</b> degree to which consumers believe <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> to be worth the money paid for it. It is widely believed that a brand with a high price is also of high quality and vice versa. This is not necessarily exclusively the case. The concept of quality and value differ from one individual to another, since {{it is based on the}} subjective perception of each individual. As mentioned earlier, associations form part of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> image that consumers have of a brand. One of these associations might be their perception of quality of <b>the</b> <b>brand,</b> given <b>the</b> price of <b>the</b> <b>brand.</b> A luxury brand can charge a premium price, on the basis of various characteristics, one of which is the fact that <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> is perceived to be of high quality. Oakley is a luxury brand and charges a premium price. The study examines the quality and price of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> by looking at the perceptions that consumers have of <b>the</b> <b>brand</b> with reference to the price/quality relationship, which represents one of the associations that contribute towards the formation of consumers’ brand image...|$|R
