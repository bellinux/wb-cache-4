The KBFX shows were included in the upgrade to HD; however, they are presented in downconverted standard definition widescreen on KBAK-DT2 (which serves as a full-power companion to KBFX's low-power Class A digital <b>terrestrial</b> <b>signal).</b>|$|E
50|$|Roughly {{around the}} spring of 2000, WUEV began to {{experiment}} with the Icecast streaming technology for the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>signal</b> by using a testbed of MP3 songs on the local server. As early as 1999, student producers at the station were using MP3 encoded songs during live sessions in the on-air studio, and {{attempts were made to}} create playlists using MusicMatch and a computer for automation. However, much was not known about the technology and hardware constraints severely limited automation until the new automation system was installed.|$|E
50|$|WBKO's {{home market}} area is very small, so WBKO's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>signal</b> covers {{all of the}} Bowling Green media market, and spills into nearby {{portions}} of three neighboring market areas. The signal can be picked up as far west as Hopkinsville, {{as far north as}} the Rough River Lake areas, Owensboro and Elizabethtown, as far east as Columbia, and as far south as the far northern suburbs of Nashville. People with over-the-air receivers in the northeast side of Clarksville, Tennessee can also pick up WBKO's signal.|$|E

50|$|The S4C {{analogue}} signal also spilled over {{on to the}} east coast of the Republic of Ireland. In the past it was rebroadcast {{in a number of areas}} there on UHF <b>terrestrial</b> <b>signals</b> by so-called 'deflectors', however Channel 4 is now re-transmitted from satellite by the few remaining deflectors. Up until the 1990s, S4C was also carried by some Irish cable and MMDS providers before being replaced by Channel 4. The S4C signal also continues to overspill into the Republic of Ireland via the Freesat satellite service.|$|R
