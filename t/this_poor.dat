5|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} islands, mineral deposits are abundant. The country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa {{and one of the}} largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite, and zinc. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>poor</b> management, high population density, and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped. Geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the Philippines has harnessed more successfully. The Philippines is the world's second-biggest geothermal producer behind the United States, with 18% of the country's electricity needs being met by geothermal power.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|The first talkies {{shown in}} the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man (both 1929), came from the United States and were {{screened}} in late 1929. This encouraged Krugers to make Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor), an adaptation of the book by Yuhana, in 1930. The comedy, made with a single system camera that Krugers had obtained {{with the help of}} his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership, is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country, but had poor technical quality. It was a critical failure, as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog, something which is forbidden for Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the context}} of the battle itself, the failure of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{technical}} innovations of the railway {{and the large}} passenger demand, the C was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low and declining (2​18% in 1898, 1​78% in 1899 and 1​14% in 1900) and the company {{had been accused of}} extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C station at Angel to the main-line stations at King's Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee's review meant {{that it had to be}} resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding <b>this,</b> <b>poor</b> management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E

25|$|The {{central concern}} {{of the task force}} was lack of {{cooperation}} within the US Intelligence Community.

25|$|Overall, between 1960 and 1989, {{the growth}} rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was {{slightly}} above the world average (based on 102 countries). According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union.

25|$|From World War II {{until the}} {{creation}} of DIA in 1961, the three Military Departments collected, produced and distributed their intelligence for individual use. This {{turned out to be}} duplicative, costly, and ineffective as each department provided their own, often conflicting estimates to the Secretary of Defense and other Federal agencies. While the Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 aimed to correct these deficiencies, the intelligence responsibilities remained unclear, the coordination was poor and the results fell short of national reliability and focus. As a result of <b>this</b> <b>poor</b> organization, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed the Joint Study Group in 1960 to find better ways for organizing the nation's military intelligence activities.|$|E
