5|$|Native Americans {{have lived}} in the Chetco River's {{watershed}} for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19thcenturies, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and other precious metals were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water.|$|E

5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities asked to be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ingrid {{was one of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones, {{along with}} Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24‑hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September12 in the Gulf of Mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September16, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. The hurricane was also <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> form in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016.|$|E
