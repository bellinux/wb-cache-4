25|$|In 207 BCE, Xiang Yu's army {{advanced}} towards Julu {{and he sent}} Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to {{lead the}} 20,000 strong vanguard army to cross the river and attack the Qin forces led by Zhang Han, while he followed behind with the remaining majority of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations, in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days or die trapped before {{the walls of the}} city with no supplies or any hope of escape. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Chu forces scored a great victory after nine engagements, defeating the 300,000 strong Qin army. After the battle, other rebel forces, including those not from Chu, came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration for his martial valour. When Xiang Yu received them at the gate, the rebel chiefs were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not even dare <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps as a combat {{correspondent}} and would {{take part in the}} Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. [...] In the amphibious landing on February 19, 1945, Smith went ashore in the third wave of soldiers with his rifle but without his typewriter, which had been lost at sea.

[...] On the subject of the iconic Iwo Jima flag raising, Smith addressed a sometimes discussed controversy of a second, larger American flag being raised to replace the initially planted one (as the first one was too small to be seen by the soldiers fighting on the island). [...] He recalled that he [...] "happened <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mt. Suribachi from the beach that day and saw [...] rippling in the breeze. [...] I did not feel cheated because I had not seen the first one." ...|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} router implementation, {{there may be a}} separate forwarding information base that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the control plane, but used by the forwarding plane <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> packets, <b>at</b> very high speed, and decide how to handle them.|$|R

60|$|He {{moved his}} feet uneasily {{on the marble}} hearth, and put his {{cigarette}} <b>to</b> his mouth, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling.|$|R

60|$|Then {{she felt}} the man's hand on her shoulder, {{and that he was}} {{compelling}} her <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|As Eleanor {{read the}} article her face flushed with indignation, and when she had {{finished}} it, she almost feared <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her father.|$|E

60|$|Once more {{he led the}} way and Peter followed.

60|$|Davenant {{made his}} adieux {{with a heavy}} heart.
