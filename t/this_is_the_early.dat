One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

The sailors and the families of Maturin and Aubrey get as far as the island of Saint Helena, where Napoleon is firmly exiled, and there the writing stops, with no hint of what might have happened in South Africa, had the squadron arrived there. There is wide acclaim for the Afterword by Richard Snow, included in the book.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} days of {{television}}, many television shows were specifically created by sponsors with the main goal of selling their product, the entertainment angle being a hook to hold audience attention (this is how soap operas got their name). A good example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> children's show The Magic Clown on NBC, which was created by Tico Bonomo essentially as an advertisement for Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. It is claimed that the first infomercial for a commercial product appeared in 1949 or 1950, for a blender. Accounts vary on whether this was for a VitaMix blender as claimed by Vitamix or from Waring Blenders as claimed in various online sources. Eventually, limits imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the amount of advertising that could appear during an hour of television did away with these programs, forcing sponsors into the background; however, a few infomercials, mainly those for greatest hits record sets and Shop Smith power tools, did exist during the period when commercial time was restricted.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{part of the}} {{sedimentary}} fill in the Worcester Basin is the Cisuralian (Early Permian) Bridgnorth Sandstone Formation, {{deposited in}} an aeolian environment. Unconformably above <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> Triassic Kidderminster Formation of pebble conglomerates and sandstones, deposited in a fluvial environment. The succession continues with the Early Triassic Wildmoor Sandstone Formation, followed by the Anisian (Middle Triassic) Bromsgrove Sandstone Formation, completing the Sherwood Sandstone Group (SSG) sequence in this basin. The overlying Mercia Mudstone Group (MMG) has the Tarporley Siltstone Formation locally at its base, but elsewhere it passes straight from the SSG into the Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. This unit locally contains a thick development of halite known as the Droitwich Halite Member. A thin sandstone is then developed, the Arden Sandstone Formation before passing upwards into the Branscombe Mudstone Formation. The final part of the MMG is the dolomitic mudstones of the Blue Anchor Formation. The Triassic succession is completed by a thinly developed Rhaetian age Penarth Group sequence of marine mudstones. The youngest preserved sequence in the basin is the fully marine Lias Group, consisting of the Blue Lias Formation, the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, the Dyrham Formation, the Marlstone Rock Formation, the Whitby Mudstone Formation and the Bridport Sand Formation.|$|E

Secondly, the triplet loss and doubly convolutional layer both introduced by our method positively affect the accuracy of image classification. To our best knowledge, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> application of both the triplet and double convolution operation into CNN-based classifier. Thirdly, similar to human’s visual system, our proposed CNN can extract the multi-scale features including both the local and global features of the front-view-based images of the refrigerator. As the extraction of multi-scale features of the image plays a vital role in human’s visual system, our method can implement it automatically. Finally, our approach performs with an impressive superiority to both the state-of-the-art image classification techniques and human’s visual inspection. Our proposed CNN-based method is a potential tool for image classification of the refrigerator and other images with similar characteristics as the front-view of the refrigerator.|$|E
3000|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic {{heavy metal}} {{and is also}} {{known as one of the}} major {{environmental}} pollutants. Moderate Cd contamination of arable soils can result in considerable Cd accumulation in edible parts of crops (Arao and Ae 2003; Arao et al. 2003; Wolnik et al. 1983). Such levels of Cd in plants are not toxic to crops but can contribute to substantial Cd dietary intake by humans (Wagner 1993). In the case of [...] "Itai-itai disease", Cd-polluted rice was the major source of Cd intake in the patients (Yamagata and Shigematsu 1970). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> case of chronic Cd toxicity in general populations without specific industrial exposure. Even in recent general populations in Japan, the internal Cd level is higher than those of other countries and this is largely because of daily consumption of Japanese rice which contains relatively high Cd (Watanabe et al., 1996; Watanabe et al. 2000; Tsukahara et al. 2003). Cd concentrations of recent Japanese rice have been constantly higher compared to those of other countries (Watanabe et al., 1996; Shimbo et al., 2001), although the values are much lower than the limit established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO (0.4 mg/kg). In some areas in China and Thailand, production of highly Cd-polluted rice and renal disfunctions among populations were reported (Nordberg et al., 1997; Jin et al., 2002; Honda et al., 2010). In the United States, increased consumption of rice and other cereals contributes to the recent increase of the dietary Cd intake (Egan et al. 2007). Many reports suggest importance to consider chronic effects of Cd exposure through foods (Jarup and Akesson 2009). In Japanese populations, the average dietary Cd intake (3.0 μg Cd/kg body weight/week) exceeds the tolerable weekly intake (2.5 μg Cd/kg body weight) set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and is about 50 % of a provisional tolerable monthly intake (25 μg Cd/kg body weight/month) established by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (JECFA). Reeves and Chaney (2008) suggested to consider the high Cd availability of rice for humans because of relatively low iron and zinc contents in rice-based foods (Reeves and Chaney, 2008). These suggest the importance of reducing grain Cd accumulation in rice and other cereals for better human health.|$|E

40|$|Aim:To {{discuss how}} Swarnakumari Devi 2 ̆ 7 s family {{connections}} {{as much as}} her sex contributed to why her work faded from the memory of nationalist India. Introduction: The historical context that helped to produce the writing of Swarna-kumari Devi Ghosal also gives us a glimmer {{into some of the}} possible reasons why her work faded from the literary memory of nationalist India. Some of that context is hinted at in the back pages of her collection of short stories in English, published in 1919 by Ganesh and Co., Madras. Reminding us of the inescapable connection between capitalism and knowledge, these back pages are dedicated to an advertisement of Ganesh and Co. 2 ̆ 7 s other recently published texts. Grouped under the heading 2 ̆ 2 Indian National Literature, 2 ̆ 2 their titles and descriptions are telling: The Indian Nation Builders, a series of biographies of 2 ̆ 2 thirty-six eminent Indians 2 ̆ 2; India for Indians, which contains speeches delivered by C. R. Das on the subject of Home Rule; How India Can Save the Empire, another compilation of speeches, these by the members of the Indian Home Rule Deputation and other unnamed leaders, who, Indian readers are promised, will explicate 2 ̆ 2 the Present Situation and the future work before us 2 ̆ 2 (3); Is India Civilized?: Essays on Indian Culture by Sir John WoodrofFe; and almost in answer to that titanically insulting question, Art and Swadeshi by Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy. That same list of Indian National Literature announces the arrival on the political and literary scene of Swarnakumari Devis unpretentiously entitled Short Stories. Unlike the historical indeterminacy of Swarnakumari Devi 2 ̆ 7 s modest title, the names of these other texts date them much more precisely. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century in British imperial India, the second decade of that century, in fact, a time when the givenness of the empire [...] with its pretensions to being the definer of what was or was not 2 ̆ 2 civilized 2 ̆ 2 [...] was clashing with a relatively new nationalist ideology that had not quite yet found one dominant way. It was the age of Home Rule, of Swadeshi, of Hindu revivalism, violence in Bengal, and the temporary break-up of the National Congress; it was the after-Tilak-and-before-Gandhi moment in Indian history, in short, a liminal age, which might have gone in any {{one of a number of}} directions. What I will argue in this essay is that Swarnakumari Devi 2 ̆ 7 s almost forgotten collection of short stories in English, and particularly the last story, 2 ̆ 2 Mutiny, 2 ̆ 2 not only manifests the restlessness and indecisiveness of that era but contributed to the creation of the next [...] the Gandhian one. In so doing, I aim to be part of a still exclusive but growingly public conversation about this neglected author whose family connections as much as her sex got in the way of her posterity...|$|E
40|$|Both the Netherlands and Denmark {{started to}} develop wind {{energy in the}} 1970 s. Reasons were the oil crisis and the Club of Rome report, which warned of {{imminent}} shortages of traditional energy sources like oil and gas. Both countries started this development around 1975 and their governments gave active support. Furthermore, both countries have a comparable wind regime. However, {{the result of the}} development of wind energy in each country is very different. In the year 2000, Denmark had a flourishing wind turbine industry, that produced wind turbines for the world market. Furthermore, {{at the end of the}} year 2000 the cumulative installed capacity of wind turbines in Denmark was 2, 340 MW and wind turbines produced 15 % of the electricity demand. In the Netherlands, the situation was far less rosy. Although 10 to 15 wind turbine manufacturers were active on the Dutch market at the beginning of the 1980 s, in 2000 only one remained. Furthermore, at the end of the year 2000 only 442 MW of wind turbines had been installed in the Netherlands, the target for the year 2000 having been 2, 000 MW. What is the reason for this large difference in the success of the Netherlands and Denmark? This question was the starting point for our research. We investigated whether differences in learning processes in innovation systems during technology development can be the cause for this difference. Our reserach question was: To what extent did the learning processes in the Dutch and the Danish wind turbine innovation systems differ in the period 1973 - 2000 and what are the consequences of these differences? On the basis of the literature on innovation we identified four kinds of learning: learning by searching (or Research & Development), learning by doing, learning by using and learning by interacting, and the conditions that facilitate these kinds of learning. Next, we investigated the development of wind turbines in the Netherlands and in Denmark and analysed these development with a focus on the learning processes we identified. Our main conclusion is, that in the Netherlands learning by searching much more important than in Denmark, while in Denmark learning by using and learning by interacting were the main learning processes. The strong emphasis on learning by searching in the Netherlands resulted in a large amount of scientific research and a good international position of the Dutch wind energy research. However, the results of this research were hardly used by the wind turbine producers. In Denmark, the market for wind turbines was far larger and better organsied than in the Netherlands. The main reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> introduction of investment subsidies for wind turbine buyers in Denmark. There were many contacts between the wind turbine owners, the wind turbine producers and the research institute Risø. During these contacts, a lot of knowledge was exchanged between the actors. On the basis of this knowledge, the wind turbine producers developed there turbines further. We argue, that this difference in learning processes in the Dutch and Danish wind turbine innovation systems is an important reason for the difference in success between both innovation systems...|$|E
