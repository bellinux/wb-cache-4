5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, in which <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> {{as if they}} are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
25|$|Functional layouts can be redefined or {{customized}} {{within the}} operating system, by reconfiguring operating system keyboard driver, {{or with a}} use of a separate software application. Transliteration {{is one example of}} that whereby letters in other language get matched to visible Latin letters on the keyboard by the way <b>they</b> <b>sound.</b> Thus, a touch typist can type various foreign languages with a visible English-language keyboard only.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the young}} man found words, though <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> to him and to the others faint and unimpressive.|$|R
60|$|The Gazeka {{was wearing}} a pair of very squeaky boots that morning. <b>They</b> <b>sounded</b> {{deafening}} as {{he walked out of the}} room.|$|R
60|$|Arnold's {{first attempt}} at speech failed. When the words came <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> choked. There was a horrible dry feeling in his throat.|$|R
25|$|The vibraphone {{resembles the}} xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel. Each bar is {{paired with a}} {{resonator}} tube that has a motor-driven butterfly valve at its upper end. The valves are mounted on a common shaft, which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while spinning. The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to that on a piano. With the pedal up, the bars are all damped and produce a shortened sound. With the pedal down, <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> for several seconds.|$|E
25|$|Band {{members have}} cited power pop leaders Cheap Trick and Matthew Sweet as major influences. They also have cited the Talking Heads as an inspiration. John D. Luerssen of Allmusic {{has stated that}} <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> similar to The Knack, The Calling, and label-mates Fountains of Wayne. Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper has {{compared}} the Click Five to Fall Out Boy and the All-American Rejects in terms of sound and crossover appeal. In terms of songwriting, Bill Lamb of About.com has remarked that they seem reminiscent of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly has stated their vocal harmonies are similar to Queen, but they sing more like the Backstreet Boys.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} {{also applies}} to gender and sexual orientation. Munson conducted a study in which naïve listeners were asked to distinguish between heterosexual male and female speakers, and gay male and bisexual or lesbian female speakers. He found that listeners tended to classify male and female speakers by masculinity and femininity, respectively; male speakers were perceived as gay if <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> less masculine, while female speakers were identified as bisexual or lesbian if <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> less feminine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will just}} {{state to the}} ladies," [...] said the marine, turning toward the table, [...] "that the lead is a heavy weight that is lowered {{to the bottom of}} a body of water to see how deep it is, and this {{operation}} is called sounding. Well, <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> and <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> but everywhere--fore, aft, and midship--they found plenty of water; in fact, not having a line for deep-sea sounding they couldn't touch bottom at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} be careful, constable," [...] he said; but {{in the act of}} uttering these words he thought how pitiable <b>they</b> <b>sounded.</b>|$|R
500|$|Regarding the band's wide {{international}} success, Parlophone's president Miles Leonard {{has stated}} that one of Coldplay's [...] "secrets" [...] {{is that they have}} never sounded like a parochial UK artist, saying: [...] "Some bands are very proud to be British, but sometimes come across as being very ‘British’. Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> British but on the other <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> like a huge global artist." [...] In 2011 Coldplay were hailed as 'rock statesmen'.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New Yorker, Jody Rosen {{credited}} the jarring timbral and tonal {{variations on}} the song for giving a new musical sound that didn't exist in the world before Beyoncé. He further wrote, [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears." ...|$|E
500|$|For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes [...] "sound {{like they}} were made in a {{cardboard}} box. I think [...] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> like real folk songs—because {{if you go back}} into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{forced herself}} to speak through lips {{suddenly}} pale. What strange words <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> frozen things, scarcely audible! Yet the effort hurt her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Astarn first; then ahead; and, just as {{you called}} me up on the poop, sir, I fancied <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> off here, on the weather bow." ...|$|R
60|$|Acquiescence and a pause {{followed}} these remarks. <b>They</b> <b>sounded</b> all right, I thought, {{and bore}} the safe sanction of custom, and the well-worn stamp of use.|$|R
500|$|The six-part [...] "Tertiary Phase" [...] was {{broadcast}} in September and October 2004. The four-part [...] "Quandary Phase" [...] {{was broadcast}} in May 2005, and the four-part [...] "Quintessential Phase" [...] was broadcast immediately following, in May and June 2005. The names for these series were chosen because <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "less daunting, more memorable {{and are a}} bit easier to spell" [...] than the standard terms quaternary and quinary.|$|E
500|$|The E-100 {{series was}} a cost-reduced {{version of the}} A-100 {{introduced}} in 1965, with only one set of drawbars per manual, a reduced number of presets, and a slightly different tone generator. This {{was followed by the}} H-100 series, with a redesigned tonewheel generator and various other additional features. Unfortunately, the organ was not particularly well made, and suffered a reputation for being unreliable. Hammond service engineer Harvey Olsen said, [...] "When they [...] work, <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> pretty decent. But die-hard enthusiasts won't touch it." ...|$|E
500|$|Levine {{confessed that}} he doesn't use any {{hardware}} and rarely uses plugins. He says [...] "my favourites are the McDSP FilterBank for my EQ, the Waves Rvox and Renaissance Compressor as my compressors, the [...] L2, and my favourite reverb is [...] D‑Verb. I also use [...] Echo Farm, Sound Toys Echoboy, and, well that’s pretty much it. I have many plug-ins, but I don't really use them." [...] He said [...] "I’ve tried convolution reverbs, but they don’t really work. <b>They</b> <b>sound</b> cheap." [...] However, he also stated that the Avid Reverb One sounded substantially better than Altiverb to him.|$|E
60|$|Shots awoke me, I think, distant shots. And <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> {{like the}} ripping and tearing of cloth for a wound. 'Twas no new sound to me.|$|R
50|$|Grant Morrison, {{the writer}} of JLA, {{deliberately}} designed {{the members of the}} Hyperclan to be as 'kiddy' as possible; Metamorpho even commented that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> like the names of children's toys.|$|R
6000|$|The beating {{steps of}} time were hushed into silence, {{and it seemed}} to them the {{universe}} hung still. Only their hearts were audible, beating. They seemed to be living together in a world where there is no death, and indeed so it was with them then. It seemed to them that <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> and indeed <b>they</b> <b>sounded,</b> such hidden splendours in the very heart of things as none have ever reached before. Even for mean and little souls, love is the revelation of splendours. And these were giant lovers who had eaten the Food of the Gods ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews in}} the US. Rolling Stone magazine commented {{that it was}} [...] "the best Kinks album yet". Writing in his [...] "Consumer Guide" [...] column of The Village Voice, Robert Christgau commented that [...] "Lola" [...] had been an [...] "astounding single," [...] but gave Lola Versus Powerman a mixed review, saying that [...] "the melodies are still there, but in this context <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> corny rather than plaintive." [...] The single [...] "Lola" [...] received positive reviews, and, due to its success, an interview with Ray Davies by Jonathan Cott was featured as a cover story for Rolling Stone in November 1970.|$|E
500|$|... "Give me a pop-song, mate. Give me {{a fucking}} pop-song. Not {{only is it}} more fun, it's pretty fuckin' hard to write as well. You can bung in as many out-of-tune oboes as you want, but putting chords {{together}} so <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> pleasant isn't {{as simple as it}} might appear. It mightn't be the Sistine Chapel, but what is? Ollie fucking Olsen with his stupid feedback and cough mixture? The Jesus and Mary Chain, with their stupid feedback, and their stupid stage show with 800 powerful stupid lights and enough stupid dry ice to enhance their stupid stupidity up its own bullshit crappy teenage pretentious one dimensional dick witted puissant artistic enigma? ...|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – think The White Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is pretty much the only line." [...] Another reviewer’s ear hears [...] "a touch of the Ramones in their ultra simple lyrics." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the single}} as a whole, Okazaki {{described}} the B-sides as having [...] "room temperature dance beats", {{and felt that}} <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> fresh, {{in comparison to the}} highly powered [...] "Sen to Rei".|$|R
60|$|Again {{and again}} <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> the call, {{and then they}} saw the ship's head come round, and her bow put towards them, and then they fell on their knees and thanked God that they were saved.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the band}} could not {{break in the}} UK, as <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> too American. The album's sales {{disappointed}} and the band left Parlophone around 1987. A second album was released through FM Revolver, called Pleasure + Pain.|$|R
500|$|Adam Farber of Sony Music Entertainment explained: [...] "The vinyl box {{is a real}} {{treat for}} fans, {{especially}} with today's renewed and increased interest in vinyl." [...] It {{is the first time}} that ten of Slayer's studio albums have been mass-produced on vinyl. Dino Paredes of American Recordings relates: [...] "It's been years and years since the Slayer vinyl has been in print — only the two most recent albums are currently available on vinyl, the rest have been out of print for years and very hard to find. These albums sound spectacular — <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> like you've never heard them before. Everything about 'The Vinyl Conflict' — the look of it, the feel of it — is very strong, very powerful, very Slayer, from the music to the dripping, bloody pentagram on the front of the box. It's perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Supergirl" [...] {{received}} {{average to}} mixed reception from contemporary critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic said, [...] "That feeling of familiarity {{extends to the}} songs that haven't appeared anywhere else. Whether it's the happy side of Hannah ('It's All Right Here,' 'Supergirl') [...] <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> very much like what came before them." [...] Warren Truitt of About.com agreed but stated, [...] " [...] {{may be a little}} cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly compared the song's style to that of Kelly Clarkson. While reviewing a concert before the release of the soundtrack, Peter Larsen of The Orange County Register predicted it would be released as a single and become popular with children, yet [...] "saturate [...] ears for a month or two".|$|E
500|$|NME called Animals [...] "one of {{the most}} extreme, relentless, {{harrowing}} and downright iconoclastic hunks of music {{to have been made}} available this side of the sun", and Melody Maker Karl Dallas described it as an [...] "uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific". [...] Rolling Stone Frank Rose was unimpressed, writing: [...] "The 1977 Floyd has turned bitter and morose. [...] They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). [...] <b>They</b> <b>sound</b> like they've just discovered this – their message has become pointless and tedious." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] rating and found the negative reaction overly cynical, reasoning that the album functions simply as [...] "a piece of well-constructed political program music... lyrical, ugly, and rousing, all in the right places".|$|E
5000|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{the coming of}} the sword, as in [...] was one of several afflictions for which <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> the ram's horn (shofar) in alarm in every locale, because it is an affliction that spreads.|$|R
5000|$|Units were nicknamed {{for their}} {{apparent}} ability to yell during battle. The 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry, [...] "White's Cavalry", {{were given the}} nom de guerre of [...] "Comanches" [...] for the way <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> during battle.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing {{that there}} were many {{spelling}} variants of Eastern European Jewish surnames, even though <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> similar, Mokotoff collaborated with Randy Daitch to create the Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex, system which provides a phonetic alternative to searching databases of names.|$|R
