25|$|Both Democrats and Republicans were {{critical}} of Gonzales' testimony to congress, which was {{widely regarded as}} exhibiting greater loyalty <b>to</b> <b>president</b> <b>Bush</b> than to the truth.

25|$|According to the US, as {{the rebels}} {{approached}} the capital, James B. Foley, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, {{got a phone}} call from a high-level aide to Aristide, asking if the U.S. could protect Aristide and help facilitate his departure if he resigned. The call prompted a series of events that included a middle-of-the-night phone call <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and a scramble to find a plane to carry Aristide into exile. He traveled voluntarily via motorcade to the airport with his own retinue of security guards, including some contracted Americans. Before takeoff, Aristide gave a copy of his resignation letter to Foley's aide.|$|E

In June 2001, she joined with Senator Charles Schumer to speak out again on the issue, sending a letter <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> urging him to make clear to Yasser Arafat that peace is not possible without a full and immediate cessation of the Palestinian Authority's hateful rhetoric and urging that funding be contingent on the cessation of such incitement. In October 2003, she joined the Senate Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Palestinian textbooks and other media that glorifies violence and martyrdom.|$|E
25|$|The act, as {{currently}} structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient hospital service payments and ambulatory care payments {{that would otherwise}} undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the CBO. Gail Wilensky, a deputy assistant <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> Snr advising him on health and welfare issues from 1992–1993 and previously a director of Medicare and Medicaid has expressed concern that this might affect seniors {{access to health care}} if the changes are made too quickly, while other activists such as Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund argue that Medicare Advantage plans cost the taxpayer $1,000 per policyholder more than if the person had been insured through traditional fee for services.|$|E
25|$|Mahony {{spoke out}} on {{provisions}} in immigration bills, {{such as the}} Sensenbrenner-King Bill, debated by Congress in late 2005 and 2006. He wrote <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> that certain proposed measures would effectively outlaw the provision of charitable assistance and religious ministry to individuals not in valid immigration status. On Ash Wednesday, 2006, Mahony {{announced that he would}} order the clergy and laity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to ignore H.R. 4437 if it were to become law. He personally lobbied senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives. Mahony also blamed the Congress for the illegal immigration crisis due to their failure to act on the issue in the previous 20 years, opposed H.R. 4437 as punitive and open to abusive interpretation, and supported S. 2611.|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg L.P.'s media critic Craig Seligman wrote {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} book, calling Woodward far too deferential <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> and saying that [...] "It {{must have been a}} {{challenge}} for him to walk so confidently with Woodward's lips attached to his backside." [...] In a mixed review, conservative magazine National Review labeled Woodward's leaking of the government's eavesdropping program [...] "disgraceful" [...] and stated that it [...] "would be helpful for the United States {{to be in a position}} to know, and to do so without having the fact publicly advertised." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{gave his}} after-dinner remarks {{in front of}} an {{audience}} described by the Associated Press as a [...] "Who's Who of power and celebrity". More than 2,500guests attended the event, including First Lady Laura Bush, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Peter Pace, U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, China's Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong, AOL co-founder Steve Case, model and tennis player Anna Kournikova, and actor George Clooney. Colbert spoke directly <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> several times, satirically praising his foreign policy, lifestyle, and beliefs, and referring to his declining approval rating and popular reputation.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the high}} damage from Hurricane Bob, {{president}} George H.W. Bush declared the following states as disaster (in order): Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New York. Damage in Maine was insufficient to qualify for individual family assistance. Instead, the declaration allocated federal funding to reimburse cities for debris removal, repairing damaged public buildings, and other municipal expenses {{for each of the}} states. Despite the declaration, the federal government did not immediately provide aid to the affected region. This was partially due <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> considering the storm a [...] "disaster but not an emergency", which therefore required cuts from other budgets to offset the relief aid. This was in opposition to the Democratic-controlled Congress, who requested an expedited process. The name Bob was subsequently retired by the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane committee, and will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

500|$|Like Achtung Baby, the 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal {{break with}} the band's past. In {{contrast}} to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill [...] "sensory overload" [...] in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles. Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, the group's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including the leather-clad egomaniac [...] "The Fly", the greedy televangelist [...] "Mirror Ball Man", and the devilish [...] "MacPhisto". Prank phone calls were made <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush,</b> the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy. Zoo TV was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, earning US$67million.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{was head}} of the local chapter of the Young Conservatives of Texas during his time at Baylor University. In 1984, Paul took a {{semester}} off to aid his father's primary challenge to Republican Senator Phil Gramm. While attending Duke University School of Medicine, Paul volunteered for his father's 1988 Libertarian presidential campaign. In response <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> breaking his election promise to not , Paul founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union in 1991. In 1994, Paul founded the anti-tax organization Kentucky Taxpayers United (KTU), and was chair of the organization from its inception. He has often cited his involvement with KTU as the foundation of his involvement with state politics. Described as [...] "ideological and conservative" [...] by the Lexington Herald-Leader, the group considered itself nonpartisan, examining Kentucky legislators' records on taxation and spending and encouraging politicians to publicly pledge to vote uniformly against tax increases. Paul managed his father's successful 1996 Congressional campaign, in which the elder Paul returned to the House after a twelve-year absence. The elder Paul defeated incumbent Democrat-turned-Republican Greg Laughlin in the Republican primary, despite Laughlin's support from the NRCC and Republican leaders such as Newt Gingrich and George W. Bush.|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Colbert, the {{featured}} guest, described President Bush's thought processes using {{the definition of}} truthiness. Editor and Publisher used [...] "truthiness" [...] to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, {{in an article published}} the same day titled [...] "Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?" [...] E reported that the [...] "blistering comedy 'tribute' <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close" [...] and that many people at the dinner [...] "looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power". E reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew [...] "possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever", and published {{a letter to the editor}} asserting that [...] "Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness". On the same weekend, The Washington Post and others also reported on the event. Six months later, in a column titled [...] "Throw The Truthiness Bums Out", The New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary" [...] and christened it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections.|$|E
50|$|While the frosty {{relations}} {{were due to}} the Canadian government's opposition <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush's</b> policies, {{there has also been}} criticism of Chrétien for tolerating anti-American outbursts from his aide, while Martin attempted to paint his opponent, Conservative Stephen Harper, as pro-American during the 2004 Canadian federal election.|$|R

2500|$|Daschle's critics {{charged the}} Democrat with using filibusters to block {{confirmation}} {{of several of}} Bush's nominees to the federal judiciary and of being {{out of step with}} the views of South Dakota voters on other political and social issues: [...] "The GOP had targeted Daschle, the Senate minority leader, claiming he had been the chief obstruction <b>to</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> on such issues as tax cuts, judicial nominees and the war in Iraq." ...|$|E

The destruction of evidence linked to Tillman's death, including his personal journal, led his mother to speculate that he was murdered.
