5|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is trapped in a prison from which escape is impossible, the TARDIS has blown up with River Song (Alex Kingston) inside, and the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) has been shot and killed by an Auton replica of her fiancé Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). As the universe is collapsing, the Doctor uses time travel to solve <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> ultimately reboot the universe.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|After his {{promotion}} to Oberfähnrich on 1 February 1934, Mölders began his pilot {{training at the}} Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German transport flying school) in Cottbus, lasting from 6 February 1934 to 31 December 1934. On 1 March 1934, {{he was promoted to}} Leutnant and assigned to the recently established Luftwaffe. In the early stages of his pilot training, he suffered continually from nausea and vomiting, but he eventually overcame <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> finished the course {{at the top of his}} class. The next phase of his military pilot's training was from 1 January 1935 to 30 June 1935 at the combat flying school in Tutow and the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) at Schleißheim near Munich. He received the newly created Pilot's Badge of the Luftwaffe on 21 May 1935.|$|E

5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> the Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E

25|$|Several {{problems}} in computational complexity and geometric graph theory may {{be classified as}} complete for the existential theory of the reals. That is, every problem in the existential theory of the reals has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to an instance of one of <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> in turn these problems are reducible to the existential theory of the reals.|$|E
25|$|The spinner may be {{constructed}} from aluminium or fibreglass. Often softer grades of aluminium {{are used to}} reduce the tendency to crack in service. Early fibreglass spinners introduced as kits for the homebuilt aircraft market in the early 1990s initially developed a poor reputation for cracking. More recent models have resolved <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> they now function as well as aluminium ones do.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{testing and}} {{evaluation}} {{showed that the}} aircraft had poor handling, being unstable laterally, prone to Dutch roll and to severe flexing of the rear fuselage. Following a forced landing it was rebuilt incorporating recommendations made in reports from Ministry test pilots to try to resolve <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> was powered by Kestrel III engines. It was then given the name Vickers Vanox by Vickers.|$|E
25|$|The {{functioning}} of the school was also handicapped {{by a lack of}} permanent facilities, especially in quarters, and the school did not have a permanent academic building. When the five-year expansion program outlined in the Air Corps Act of 1926 failed to address <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> the creation of new units at Langley interrupted the {{functioning of}} the practical flying course, the Air Service began seeking a new location for the Tactical School.|$|E
25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since {{the world is full}} of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, we are a subject to global warming and governments do little to save us. Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion we follow.|$|E

25|$|The 5th Panzer Army led by Hasso von Manteuffel to {{the south}} of the 12th SS Panzer had {{advanced}} much further over more accessible terrain and enjoyed much greater initial success. But by 24 December, despite their more rapid advance and inflicting more losses on the Americans, the 5th Panzer Army was bogged down short of the Meuse. They were isolated and encountered strong pockets of resistance, traffic jams, and supply problems. <b>These</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> American air power eventually stopped this arm of the offensive also.|$|E
25|$|Jupiter's uniquely harsh {{radiation}} environment caused over 20 anomalies {{over the}} course of Galileo mission, in addition to the incidents expanded upon below. Despite exceeding its radiation design limit by at least a factor of three, the spacecraft survived all these anomalies. Work-arounds were found eventually for all of <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> Galileo was never rendered entirely non-functional by Jupiter's radiation. The radiation limits for Galileo computers were based off data returned from Pioneers 10 and 11, since much of the design work was underway before the two Voyagers arrived at Jupiter in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The TSP, in {{particular}} the Euclidean variant of the problem, has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce good quality solutions quickly. These results suggest that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first issue of the Journal of Problem Solving was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.|$|E

25|$|The ADF was not {{sufficiently}} prepared for integrating women into all units. Integration was hindered by entrenched discriminatory attitudes, {{sexual harassment and}} a perception that less demanding standards were applied to women. This led {{to a number of}} scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment on board , and the RAN's mishandling of these complaints. These scandals did great harm to the ADF's reputation at the time when it most needed servicewomen. The Defence Equality Organisation was established in 1997 in response to <b>these</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> it developed frameworks to facilitate the acceptance of women throughout the ADF.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the George Washington University Medical School {{was placed}} on {{probation}} by its accrediting body, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which cited a number of issues. Although GW declined to publish the entire list, among these were an outdated system of managing its curriculum, high levels of student debt, and inadequate study and lounge space for its students. A Washington Post article uncovered other issues including possible conflicts of interest involving certain medical school administrators and Universal Health Services, the private corporation that owns and operates GW's teaching hospital. The medical school implemented a plan to rectify <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> subsequently accepted the resignation of two top administrators.|$|E
25|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{formula is}} frequently prepared improperly, resulting in high infant mortality due to malnutrition and {{diseases such as}} diarrhea and pneumonia.
