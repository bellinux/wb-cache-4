500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking {{to be just a}} normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E
