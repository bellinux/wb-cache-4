Eventually the aircraft redeemed itself when two squadrons (48 F-111As) from the 474th deployed to Takhli in September 1972, in order to participate in the aerial offensive against North Vietnam under Operation Linebacker II. During this deployment the F-111s operated day and night, in all weather conditions and without electronic countermeasures escort, and relied on less aerial refueling support than other tactical aircraft. Eventually over 4000 missions were logged by the two F-111-equipped units at the cost of six aircraft lost in combat and two lost to operational causes.

The Przeworsk people there at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence {{in the hands of the}} rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{undertakes}} {{an impact}} {{analysis of a}} nation-wide diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) at three different levels. It analyses the socio-economic costs and benefits faced by the Danish public, by comparing the environmental benefits, expressed in monetary value, with costs associated with reduced tax revenues. The paper looks to the year 2020, calculating the immediate societal costs/benefits occurring <b>in</b> <b>this</b> one <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> The analysis shows that from a pure financial perspective EVs are not socially profitable as their reduction in environmental costs is by far offset by the decrease in tax revenues. The general assumption therefore is that this form of mitigation policy is growth restricting as the diffusion of EVs is accompanied by immediate high costs to the Danish Government. Nevertheless, one can argue that this growth restriction is only a short-term phenomenon, likely to be outweighed by other benefits in the long-term; benefits such as increased sector efficiency, spillover effects and increase in productivity growth in general...|$|R
