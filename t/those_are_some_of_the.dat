Through {{the process of building}} a European Research Area, this means a strong influence in the national research programmes.

The democratic participation of network and organisations members in the design process is a critical success factor. This is not accepted by everyone, but is based in sufficient case studies. Nevertheless, in order to achieve an optimization that can satisfying the requirements of agility of a network of enterprises, more complex design methods must be developed. Thus, the support to the collaborative design of distributed work in a network of enterprises, through a concurrent approaching business processes, work organisation and task content is a key factor to achieve such purposes. Increasing needs in terms of amounts of information, agility, and support for collaboration without time and space constrains, imposes the use of a computer-based model. ...|$|R

However, using this technology also brings its share of challenges in terms of debugging and detecting performance failures. Indeed, it can be more straightforward, when using the right tools, to detect performance anomalies while working with a simple layer of virtualization. For instance, if we have information about all the processes running on a machine through time, it is then possible to know for a specific thread which processes interrupted it. Because virtual machines (VM) are running in a layer independent of their host, it becomes more tedious to detect direct and indirect interactions between tasks happening inside a VM, on the host, inside a container, or even on nested or parallel VMs.|$|E

Recently, the difficulty of solving those problems has also been used as the basis of the security of cryptographic protocols. There is one serious problem with most of the algorithms for solving the above problems. Since the regulator is a real number, they use approximations to real numbers. However, the analysis of the algorithms does not determine the precision of approximation necessary for the algorithms to be correct. Therefore, the proofs of the correctness and the estimates for the running times of the algorithms are incomplete. In this thesis we give complete descriptions, correctness proofs, and complexity analyses of the important algorithms for approximating regulators, computing fundamental units, deciding ideal equivalence, and computing generators of principal ideals of quadratic orders. We describe improvements for several algorithms. We also present an object oriented implementation of all algorithms including experimental results...|$|E
