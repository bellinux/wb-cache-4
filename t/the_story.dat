5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> shone new light on the character; GameSpot called <b>the</b> <b>story</b> surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> was criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2s {{story is}} brought out via {{narrative}} pre-rendered cutscenes, the pre- and post-mission briefings, {{as well as}} in-game chatter between non-player characters, and scripted mission events. The structure for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is linear without any branching paths for alternate storylines, though there are optional covert missions which can further flesh out <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> <b>story</b> can only be continued by clearing missions and progressing through the campaign. However, players are given the option to skip a mission if they have failed it five times in a row. This gives those {{who are interested in}} <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> but less skilled, the chance to continue on with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> without frustration.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon.

She may have been commissioned to write <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on.
