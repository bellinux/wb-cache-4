The survey also recorded that 27% of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes and heart disease.

5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has <b>their</b> <b>health</b> reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, <b>their</b> <b>health</b> meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase <b>their</b> <b>health</b> {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E

40|$|Background: Genetic {{predisposition}} is a {{risk factor}} for many chronic diseases, yet {{little is known about the}} frequency in which college students seek out <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history or with whom they communicate relevant information. Purpose: This study examines motivations and barriers associated with obtaining one’s family health history and discussing it with others. Methods: Data were analyzed from 625 college students using an internet-delivered questionnaire. Questions asked respondents about intentions and motivations to obtain and share family health history as well as barriers encountered in obtaining family health history. Responses were bifurcated by participants’ sex. Chi-squared and t statistics were used to identify response differences by sex. Results: Females were significantly more likely than males to be motivated to obtain <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history, and more likely to have: shared <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history with others; state they would share <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history with others; and express a preference for sharing <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history with a wider range of people. Discussion: Educational interventions and improved student health services could be effective mechanisms to increase college students’ knowledge, awareness, and perceived importance of obtaining <b>their</b> family <b>health</b> history...|$|R

5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve <b>their</b> <b>health.</b> These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in <b>their</b> <b>health</b> after one year.|$|E

Fisher developed a relational model of spiritual health, which defines good spiritual health {{in terms of an}} individual's relationship to four domains: the personal, the communal, the environmental, and the transcendental. In the present analysis, we make comparisons between pupils educated in three types of schools: publicly funded schools without religious foundation, publicly funded schools with an Anglican foundation, and new independent Christian schools (not publicly funded). Our findings draw attention to significant differences in the levels of spiritual health experienced by pupils within these three types of schools...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition.

Nevertheless, players can regain <b>their</b> <b>health</b> by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E

5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue <b>their</b> <b>health</b> maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} whether parental worry about <b>their</b> children's <b>health</b> predicts usage of a pediatric Internet intervention for encopresis. Methods Thirty-nine families {{with a child}} diagnosed with encopresis completed a national clinical trial of an Internet-based intervention for encopresis (www. ucanpooptoo. com). Parents rated worry about <b>their</b> children's <b>health,</b> encopresis severity, current parent treatment for depression, and parent comfort with the Internet. Usage indicators were collected while participants utilized the intervention. Results Regression analyses showed that parents who reported higher baseline levels of worry about <b>their</b> children's <b>health</b> showed greater subsequent intervention use (β =. 52, p =. 002), even after accounting for other plausible predictors. Exploratory analyses indicated that this effect may be stronger for families with younger children. Conclusions Characteristics of individuals using Internet-based treatment programs, such as parental worry about <b>their</b> children's <b>health,</b> can influence intervention usage, and should be considered by developers of Internet interventions...|$|R
