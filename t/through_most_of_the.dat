5|$|The Vangshylla–Kjerringvik Ferry {{connected}} {{the municipalities of}} Inderøy and Mosvik across the sound Skarnsund, at the narrowest point of the Trondheimsfjord. The route operated from 1 June 1964 to 19 December 1991, when it {{was replaced by the}} Skarnsund Bridge. It was part of Norwegian National Road 755.

Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
5|$|The second {{match was}} between Chavo Guerrero and Jimmy Wang Yang for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The match began with Yang and Guerrero locking up, {{followed}} by Yang in control <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match. After Yang missed a moonsault, Guerrero executed a Gory Bomb.

5|$|<b>Through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} {{at least twice}} that of the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active. As a result, plates and continents were smaller. No broad blocks as old as 3Ga are found in Precambrian shields. Toward {{the end of the}} Archean, however, some of these blocks or terranes came together to form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was born}} in Rathmines in {{the south side of}} Dublin on 7 January 1883. After {{starting}} his schooling in Dublin and Edinburgh, he enrolled at Stubbington House School, at the age of ten, beginning his association with the Royal Navy. After passing out of Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1898, he progressed rapidly in rank. He commanded a destroyer during the First World War and <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interwar period.

5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{life of the}} railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays {{for a period of}} three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated {{by the fact that the}} trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
50|$|Since January 1995, {{the library}} has added {{approximately}} 6,000 volumes, or approximately 400 volumes per year, <b>most</b> <b>through</b> the regular budget, some <b>through</b> grants. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grants {{have been for}} equipment or expensive reference items.|$|R
50|$|Victoria {{has only}} ever had about 10 tunnels on its railway network, with some others on private narrow gauge tramways. This {{is due to}} the {{relatively}} easy terrain <b>through</b> which <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines were built.|$|R
50|$|Wada Village {{was created}} on April 1, 1889 within Asai District, which {{became part of}} Awa District from April 1, 1897. Wada became a town on March 13, 1899.

5|$|The harbour {{remained}} fortified <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th and 19th centuries. The final {{battle of}} the Seven Years' War in North America (the French and Indian War) was fought in 1762, in St. John's. Following a surprise capture of the town by the French early in the year, the British responded and, at the Battle of Signal Hill, the French surrendered St. John's to British forces {{under the command of}} Colonel William Amherst.|$|E
5|$|<b>Through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th century, France {{was divided}} between the Capetian kings, ruling from the Île-de-France, and kings of England, who {{controlled}} Normandy {{and much of the}} west of France. Within the Capetian territories, early experimentation in new keep designs began at Houdan in 1120, where a circular keep was built with four round turrets; internally, however, the structure remained conventionally square. A few years later, Château d'Étampes adopted a quatrefoil design. These designs, however, remained isolated experiments.|$|E
5|$|Transition {{and poor}} play marked the mid- to late-1970s. Though Collier {{agreed to come}} back to the Browns as a quarterbacks coach on an {{informal}} basis, his retirement severed the last direct link to Brown and the team's early years. Meanwhile, a new generation of players began to replace the old hands who kept Cleveland in playoff contention <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. Gene Hickerson, an anchor on the offensive line in the 1960s, retired at the end of the 1973 season. An aging Leroy Kelly left the same year to play in the short-lived World Football League. Offensive lineman Dick Schafrath, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, retired in 1971.|$|E

50|$|The Hajigak Pass {{with its}} natural beauty remains rugged and unpaved despite being the transit way into almost whole central Afghanistan. The pass and its {{surrounding}} territories remain snow-covered <b>through</b> <b>most</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, during which the traffic shifts to Shibar Pass.|$|R
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
5|$|As Corporal Bill Taylor of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, {{the player}} starts off by playing {{a part in}} D-Day, at the assault of Pointe du Hoc, to destroy a German {{artillery}} battery, and hold it against a massive German counter-offensive in the following mission. Soon after, the player captures a nearby town {{and serves as a}} sniper against mortar crews until reinforcements arrive. The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while burdened by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins {{as one of the few}} missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. The final fight has the player defeat two German Tiger I's.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater <b>through</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
