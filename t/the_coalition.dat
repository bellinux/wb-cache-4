5|$|He and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 {{to discuss}} Musharraf's removal and the {{constitutional}} amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going {{far enough to}} fulfill the Murree declaration. He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> {{did not have the}} two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies—National Assembly and Senate. He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif. <b>The</b> <b>coalition</b> criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections. Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> {{agreed to}} proceed full speed towards Musharraf's {{impeachment}} by drafting a charge-sheet against him. <b>The</b> <b>coalition</b> {{charged him with}} high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> could not agree on a decision. <b>The</b> <b>coalition</b> also could not reach a united stance {{on the future of the}} judiciary.|$|E

Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a Government; the shape of the Government is for the new Prime Minister to decide.

After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election. Whitlam rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|He and Sharif {{agreed in}} a 9 March 2008 agreement, {{known as the}} Murree Declaration, to the {{reinstatement}} by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf. The deadline was later extended to 12 May. He and Sharif held unsuccessful talks at London in May. After <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> failed to restore the judiciary, the PML-N withdrew from the government in mid-May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet. <b>The</b> <b>coalition</b> regrouped, again with the PML-N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove {{the power of the}} President to dismiss Parliament. By late May, <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> was set in a confrontation with Musharraf. At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|In October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, {{determined}} to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> had an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Coalition</b> {{believed that if}} Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him.

So rather than coordinating electoral strategies, {{as in the case of}} the parties within <b>the</b> Pan-Blue <b>coalition,</b> <b>the</b> presence of the TSU keeps the DPP from moving too far away from its Taiwan independence roots. In local elections competition tends to be fierce between Pan-Green candidates from different parties and, as a rule, joint candidates are not proposed.|$|R

5|$|On 23 November 2009, the Coalition's {{climate change}} {{spokesman}} Ian Macfarlane {{agreed to a}} deal with the government to amend the ETS legislation. The amendments provided industry with substantial compensation and exemptions from the ETS. Turnbull took the deal to Liberal MPs for formal approval, but a majority of backbenchers opposed it. Turnbull nonetheless claimed he had the Coalition's support, by counting as supporters the 20 members of <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> Shadow Cabinet who he argued should be presumed to support the deal.

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> army {{when most}} of it had crossed the Kalka River. The Mongols appear to have caught <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> forces by surprise in a fast transition from horse archer fire to massed cavalry charges, because <b>the</b> <b>coalition</b> rout began incredibly quickly: the Rus forces {{bringing up the rear}} had not yet arrived on the battle by the time the front ranks were dissolving. The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat. However, the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap and also enveloped them. The army of Chernigov, which was not aware that the battle had started, was advancing when they collided head-on with the retreating Cumans. Using smoke bombs to disrupt the coalition's ability to coordinate, the Mongol cavalry took advantage of the confusion in the Chernigov line and attacked, causing the line to collapse. This, in turn, led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov.|$|E
