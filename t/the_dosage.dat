5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
25|$|Some {{transgender}} women {{report a}} significant reduction in libido, depending on <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> of antiandrogens. A small number of post-operative transgender women take low doses of testosterone to boost their libido. Many pre-operative transgender women wait until after reassignment surgery to begin an active sex life. Raising <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the libido of some transgender women.|$|E
30|$|The {{parts of}} G. kola were {{reported}} by the respondents to provide medicinal advantages, though none of the medicinal properties of the tree was revealed but <b>the</b> <b>dosages</b> adopted by <b>the</b> villagers in catering for different type of disease. <b>The</b> <b>dosages</b> range from one to three times daily among others where other medicinal plant parts are added during {{the preparation of the}} medicinal concoctions.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} depletion of bone marrow under cancer chemotherapy is analyzed as an optimal control problem. The control represents <b>the</b> drug <b>dosage</b> of a single chemotherapeutic agent and pharmacokinetic equations which model its plasma concentration are included. <b>The</b> drug <b>dosages</b> enter <b>the</b> objective linearly. It is shown that optimal controls are bang-bang, i. e. alternate <b>the</b> drug <b>dosages</b> at full dose with rest-periods in between, and that singular controls which correspond to treatment schedules with varying dosages at less than maximum rate are not optimal. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate {{the effect of the}} pharmacokinetic equations on <b>the</b> <b>dosages.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Alli became {{available}} in the U.S. in June 2007. It is sold as 60mg capsules—half <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> of prescription orlistat.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{antidepressant}} drugs escitalopram and citalopram. Citalopram is a racemate mixture of (S)-citalopram; escitalopram (S)-citalopram is a pure enantiomer. <b>The</b> <b>dosages</b> for escitalopram are typically 1/2 of those for citalopram.|$|R
25|$|By {{delivering}} drugs almost {{directly to}} the site of action, the risk of systemic side effects is reduced. However, skin irritation may result, and for some forms such as creams or lotions, <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> is difficult to control.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to adjust <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> for elderly patients under 75 years of age. The use of ondansetron has not been studied in patients older than 75 years of age, and it is not known if dosage should be adjusted for these patients.|$|E
25|$|Urea with σ=.59 was {{introduced}} in 1956 due to low molecular weight and slow penetration of BBB. However, it can cause rebound effects and side effects such as intravascular hemolysis and phlebitis. When Urea is administered, <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> is 1.5 g/kg or 0.5 g/kg (for elderly).|$|E
50|$|Saquinavir, in the Invirase formulation, {{has a low}} and {{variable}} oral bioavailability, when given alone. The Fortovase formulation at <b>the</b> standard <b>dosage</b> delivers approximately eightfold more active drug than Invirase, also at <b>the</b> standard <b>dosage.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dosages</b> are {{determined}} {{based on the}} daily needs of the specific patient, but the timing and injection sites are not based {{on the needs of}} the patient and correspond to the amount in each dose.|$|R
50|$|For {{the same}} individual, taking the same {{molecule}} at <b>the</b> same <b>dosage,</b> <b>the</b> effect may be desirable {{at certain times}} and undesirable at other times.|$|R
25|$|Glycerol with σ=.48 was {{introduced}} in 1964, {{but it has a}} likelihood of exhibiting rebound effects and causing side effects such as hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, renal failure, hyperosmolar coma and nausea. When Glycerol is used, <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> is 1.2 g/kg followed by 0.5-1 g/kg for 3–4 hours.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> {{guidelines}} are followed, the drug reaches peak plasma levels {{after two hours}} and is completely cleared from plasma two hours after termination of the infusion period. Endogenous plasma protease inhibitors deactivate drotrecogin. Therefore, no dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients, or in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin {{should be}} {{administered}} as described within <b>the</b> <b>Dosage</b> Guidelines table {{found within the}} most current package insert. The status of the patient’s renal function and hepatic function {{must also be taken}} into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. Ofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. However, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver. Modification of <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> is required using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function (Particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction). However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection and the usual duration is 7 to 14 days.|$|E
30|$|This {{pilot study}} shows that, in <b>the</b> <b>dosages</b> used, intrauterine {{bupivacaine}} given soon after endometrial balloon ablation {{appears to be}} safe and free of any clinical toxicity, although this needs to be confirmed in a larger study.|$|R
50|$|A rem {{is a large}} dose of radiation, so the millirem (mrem), {{which is}} one thousandth of a rem, is often used for <b>the</b> <b>dosages</b> {{commonly}} encountered, such {{as the amount of}} radiation received from medical x-rays and background sources.|$|R
5000|$|Simply {{comparing}} chromium dosage {{between human}} clinical trials and rodent model studies, {{there appears to}} be a large disparity in <b>the</b> <b>dosages.</b> <b>The</b> maximum amount is 1 mg of Cr per day in humans, whereas rodent studies have used between 80 to 10 000 mg of Cr/kg of body weight per day. Translating <b>the</b> rodent <b>dosage</b> to that of humans, and accounting for their faster metabolism, results in about 2 to 260 mg of Cr per day for humans.|$|R
25|$|Methylphenidate is {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The addition of behavioural modification therapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)) can have additional benefits on treatment outcome. <b>The</b> <b>dosage</b> used can vary quite significantly among individuals; consequently, dosage must be titrated precisely.|$|E
25|$|In chickens, most of <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> {{compensated}} genes {{exist on}} the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientists}} or {{doctors who}} oppose water fluoridation {{argue that it}} has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is pharmacologically obsolete. Arvid Carlsson has argued that fluoridation violates modern pharmacological principles and doesn't take into account individual variations in response, which can be considerable even when <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> is fixed.|$|E
40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{with high}} level initial hardness was softened with various lime dosage varying from 30 % to 180 % of the stoechiometric amount. Both the initial and final parameters such as total hardness, calcium hardness, total alkalinity, pH were measured and compared {{to get the}} idea of removal efficiency with different lime <b>dosage.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that with 120 % lime <b>dosage,</b> <b>the</b> treated water has lowest total alkalinity, magnesium hardness and total hardness compared to <b>the</b> other lime <b>dosages.</b> <b>The</b> total hardness removal could achieve 60 %, while the alkalinity could get the 72 % removal. However, <b>the</b> optimum lime <b>dosage</b> for removing calcium hardness {{was found to be}} 90 % of <b>the</b> stoichiometric lime <b>dosage...</b>|$|R
50|$|Young {{devised a}} rule of thumb for {{determining}} a child's drug dosage. Young's Rule states that <b>the</b> child <b>dosage</b> is equal to <b>the</b> adult <b>dosage</b> multiplied by <b>the</b> child's age in years, divided by the sum of 12 plus the child's age.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised that serum levels {{may not be an}} {{acceptable}} marker for transdermally administered hormones, that some women have experienced significant side effects while following the protocol and have stopped using it, and that <b>the</b> <b>dosages</b> used are too high and not physiologic.|$|R
25|$|In 1848, Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old {{girl who}} was having an {{infected}} toenail removed, died after being given the anesthetic. Her autopsy establishing {{the cause of death}} was undertaken by John Fife assisted by Robert Mortimer Glover. A number of physically fit patients died after inhaling it. However, in 1848 John Snow developed an inhaler that regulated <b>the</b> <b>dosage</b> and so successfully reduced the number of deaths.|$|E
25|$|Formulation studies then {{consider}} {{such factors as}} particle size, polymorphism, pH, and solubility, as all of these can influence bioavailability and hence the activity of a drug. The drug must be combined with inactive ingredients by a method which ensures that the quantity of drug present is consistent in each dosage unit e.g. each tablet. <b>The</b> <b>dosage</b> should have a uniform appearance, with an acceptable taste, tablet hardness, or capsule disintegration.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly {{the mixture}} was {{ground to a}} paste, boiled in water, and {{administered}} as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>dosage,</b> they might remain unconscious for 6–24 hours. The active ingredients in tsūsensan were scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produced a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cellulase {{named as}} Celluclast 1. 5 L {{was used to}} deal with {{bleached}} softwood pulp. By analyzing the changes of water retention value and crystallinity of fiber after enzymatic treatment, studied the influence of cellulase to aggregation structure of bleached softwood pulp. The results show that with the increasing of <b>the</b> enzyme <b>dosage,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of long-fiber decreases {{and the content of}} fines increases. Water retention value of pulp first decreases and then increases. The fiber crystal does not change with the enzymatic treatment, but with the increasing of <b>the</b> enzyme <b>dosage,</b> <b>the</b> crystallinity of fiber first increases and then decreases. It indicates that the cellulase would act on the crystalline region of fiber in <b>the</b> higher enzyme <b>dosage...</b>|$|R
