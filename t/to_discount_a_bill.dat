50|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} the embryos appears <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>an</b> animal - or indeed embryonic - interpretation altogether. Cell division without enlargement appears to continue beyond what it would in embryos, and without other embryonic traits becoming apparent.

25|$|Fearing that juries {{would find}} it {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>an</b> implicating confession against a codefendant who stood alongside the confessor, the Court discounted such instructions. In a subsequent case, Parker, the Court was split on the same issue where each defendant had made his own confession. Writing in concurrence, Justice Blackmun argued that introduction of a codefendant's own interlocking confession could cause a harmless violation of the Confrontation Clause (he found such an example in that case), but {{that there were other}} foreseeable cases in which it could lead to a more harmful violation.|$|R
40|$|C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) {{is found}} in and {{released}} from vascular endothelial cells. Recently, a novel role has been suggested for this peptide, that of an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor or EDHF. Implicit in this proposal is a widespread role for CNP as a key mediator of vascular dilatation. In {{this issue of the}} British Journal of Pharmacology, Leuranguer et al. compare the profile of membrane potential changes evoked with this putative EDHF or with endogenous EDHF (activated with ACh) in small carotid arteries. Marked differences between the two profiles lead them <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> possible role for CNP as an EDHF...|$|R
5000|$|Option-adjusted spread (OAS) is {{the yield}} spread {{which has to}} be added to a {{benchmark}} yield curve <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> security's payments <b>to</b> match its market price, using a dynamic pricing model that accounts for embedded options. OAS is hence model-dependent. This concept can be applied to a mortgage-backed security (MBS), or another bond with embedded options, or any other interest rate derivative or option. More loosely, the OAS of a security can be interpreted as its [...] "expected outperformance" [...] versus the benchmarks, if the cash flows and the yield curve behave consistently with the valuation model.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{term used}} in the retail industry. Retailers {{contract}} with their suppliers to supply a quantity of product in a specified time period to a specific location at an agreed price. The quantity and value of the balance of contract represents a risk to the retailer {{from the point of}} view that the retailer will have <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> product that experiences a slump in demand. The setting of targets and maxima at various levels in the retailer's product hierarchies and time dimensions; and the subordination of purchasing to these limits, is known as [...] "Commitment control".|$|R

50|$|Once you collect enough commodities, you {{can spend}} them to {{purchase}} tools, which range from pottery or astronomy to democracy or monotheism. By acquiring these tools, players' civilizations gain victory points. The tools also give each civilization particular advantages during the gameplay. Tools are divided into categories such as Science, Craft, and Civics. Purchasing a tool of one category normally entitles you <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discount</b> <b>to</b> further purchases in that category, and often also entitles you <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discount</b> <b>to</b> the purchase of specific tools.

30|$|There {{are large}} {{differences}} among states {{as to how}} the bond amount is calculated. In Queensland, the amount of financial assurance is calculated by determining the cost to reclaim the site minus any applicable <b>discounts.</b> <b>To</b> obtain <b>a</b> <b>discount,</b> <b>a</b> set of mandatory criteria must first be met (World Bank Group 2008). In Western Australia, the calculation method for performance bonds uses a minimum bond rate based on the mine’s surface area disturbance, with minimum bond rates for small areas (Government of Western Australia 2014).|$|R
50|$|Psychological {{assessment}} {{also has}} {{a role in the}} legal setting. Psychologists might be asked to assess the reliability of a witness, the quality of the testimony a witness gives, the competency of an accused person, or determine what might have happened during a crime. They also may help support a plea of insanity or <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> plea. Judges may use the psychologist's report to change the sentence of a convicted person, and parole officers work with psychologists to create a program for the rehabilitation of a parolee. Problematic areas for psychologists include predicting how dangerous a person will be. There are currently no accurate measure for this prediction, however there is often a need for this prediction to prevent dangerous people from returning to society.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{external}} {{evidence is}} necessary to corroborate a view derived solely from the Muslim literary account, lack of such corroboration is an important argument against that account's historicity. This approach is therefore more open than the 'traditional' to acceptance of an argumentum e silentio. For if we are ready <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>an</b> uncorroborated report of an event, we must accept {{that there may be}} nothing with which to replace it: that the event simply did not happen. That there is no evidence for it outside of the [...] "traditional account" [...] thus becomes positive evidence in support of the hypothesis that it did not happen.

40|$|Consumers spontaneously {{construct}} attributions {{for negative}} {{events such as}} product-harm crises. Base-rate information influences these attributions. The research findings suggest that for brands with positive prior beliefs, a high (vs. low) base rate of product-harm crises leads to less blame if the crisis {{is said to be}} similar to others in the industry (referred to as the "discounting effect"). However, in the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the "subtyping effect"). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> first crisis also tend <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> second crisis for the same brand, whereas consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again...|$|R

40|$|How do voters {{respond when}} {{politicians}} change positions over time? The answer {{is fundamental to}} understanding candidate competition, election outcomes, and representation in democracies. We develop a model in which repositioning affects voter behavior through two channels. First, repositioning causes voters <b>to</b> <b>discount</b> <b>a</b> candidate’s current policy pronouncements when judging their proximity to the candidate. Second, repositioning prompts voters to draw negative inferences about a candidate’s character. We test the model by administering survey-based experiments to {{a representative sample of}} 7, 495 U. S. adults. Our data confirm that repositioning changes voter perceptions about both proximity and character, and that repositioning is costly on average. We then use our data to derive the optimal strategies for candidates. Our equilibrium analysis shows how voters, by reacting negatively to repositioning, deter politicians from adjusting their positions when public opinion changes or new policy-relevant information comes to ligh...|$|R
