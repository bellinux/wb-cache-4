On a tip to police from Rosie Wrigley, a vagrant <b>tippler,</b> Lomax and his men track the main mutation to Westminster Abbey, where it has crawled high up on a metal work scaffolding inside.

By having all the power in London diverted through the cables and into the scaffolding, Quatermass succeeds in cremating the Carroon-creature by electrocution, just as it has entered the final phase before release of its spores.|$|E
500|$|The next {{acquisition}} of locomotives took {{place after the}} British Moss Peat Company was acquired by Fisons in 1963. They ordered three [...] machines from R A Lister and Company, who were based in Dursley, Gloucestershire. They consisted of {{little more than an}} engine and driver's seat mounted on a chassis, and were used on the moors where the peat was loaded into wagons, only returning to the works for maintenance. Two were delivered to Swinefleet in 1964, and one went to Hatfield. A second machine for the Hatfield operation was ordered in 1967. Wooden peat trucks were gradually phased out following the purchase of 100 steel wagons in 1963 and 1964. They were manufactured in Leeds by Robert Hudson (Raletrux) Ltd, and were subsequently fitted with a fine inner mesh, to enable them to carry fragmented peat rather than turves. The new wagons had a side-opening door, and a <b>tippler</b> was installed to allow them to be emptied automatically.|$|E
500|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} {{that as of}} 2010 there were 208 million people with alcoholism worldwide (4.1% of the population over 15 years of age). In the United States about 17 million (7%) of adults and 0.7 million (2.8%) of those age 12 to 17 years of age are affected. It is more common among males and young adults, becoming less common in middle and old age. It is the least common in Africa at 1.1% and has the highest rates in Eastern Europe at 11%. Alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths in 2013 up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) {{are believed to be}} due to alcohol. It often reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years. In the United States it resulted in economic costs of $224 billion USD in 2006. Many terms, some insulting and others informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism including: <b>tippler,</b> drunkard, dipsomaniac, and souse. In 1979, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of [...] "alcoholism" [...] due to its inexact meaning, preferring [...] "alcohol dependence syndrome".|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, a coal <b>tipple</b> was {{typically}} used at a bituminous coal mine, where removing impurities was important but sorting by size {{was only a}} secondary, minor concern.

60|$|Such a play as Los Borrachos {{is nothing}} less than a genre picture of Seville life. It reminds one of a {{painting}} by Teniers; and I should like to give some idea of it, since it is really one of the best examples of the class, witty, varied, and vivacious. But an obstacle presents itself in the fact that I can find no vestige of a plot. The authors set out to characterise the various lovers of the vine, (nowhere in Andalusia are the devotees of the yellow Manzanilla more numerous than in Seville,) and with telling strokes have drawn the good-natured <b>tippler,</b> the surly <b>tippler,</b> the religious <b>tippler.</b> To these they have added other types, which every Andalusian can recognise as old friends--the sharp-tongued harridan, the improviser of couplets with his ridiculous vanity, the flower-seller, and the 'prentice-boy of fifteen, who, notwithstanding his tender years, is afflicted with love for the dark-eyed heroine. The action takes place first in a street, then in a court-yard, lastly in a carpenter's shop. There are dainty love-scenes between Soledad, the distressed maiden, and Juanillo, the flower-seller; and one, very Spanish, where the witty and precocious apprentice offers her his diminutive hand and heart. Numerous people come and go, the drunkards drink and quarrel and make peace; the whole thing, if somewhat confused, is very life-like, and runs with admirable lightness and ease. It is true that the play has neither beginning nor end, but perhaps that only makes it seem the truer; and if the scenes have no obvious connection they are all amusing and characteristic. It is acted with extraordinary spirit. The players, indeed, are not acting, but living their ordinary lives, and it is pleasant to see the zest with which they throw themselves into the performance. When the hero presses the heroine in his arms, smiles and passionate glances pass between them, which suggest that even the love-making is not entirely make-believe.|$|E

60|$|I have {{sometimes}} {{thought that this}} facility of men in believing {{that they are still}} what they once meant to be--this undisturbed appropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy relic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to soberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a <b>tippler</b> whom the need of a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the turpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood. It is notorious that a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till he at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the very first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a reproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all evidence? There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent.|$|E

[...] It's simply preposterous. You wouldn't be such a fool as to waste the time.

60|$|Paine's {{practical}} demeanor, {{and much}} of his theoretical belief, {{was a mixture of}} the French and English schools of a century ago, and the best of both. Like most old-fashion'd people, he drank a glass or two every day, but was no <b>tippler,</b> nor intemperate, let alone being a drunkard. He lived simply and economically, but quite well--was always cheery and courteous, perhaps occasionally a little blunt, having very positive opinions upon politics, religion, and so forth. That he labor'd well and wisely for the States in the trying period of their parturition, and in the seeds of their character, there seems to me no question. I dare not say how much of what our Union is owning and enjoying to-day--its independence--its ardent belief in, and substantial practice of radical human rights--and the severance of its government from all ecclesiastical and superstitious dominion--I dare not say how much of all this is owing to Thomas Paine, but I am inclined to think a good portion of it decidedly is.|$|E

He could not have devised a less felicitous compliment. Tickell's poem was specially praised in the Spectator for its freedom from the follies of [...] "pagan theology." [...] Addison laughed at the whole tiresome tribe of gods and goddesses, and, with good-humoured pleasantry, warned the versifiers, who were about to celebrate the Peace, against introducing [...] "trifling antiquated fables unpardonable in a poet that was past sixteen." [...] He laid stress upon the circumstance that in a panegyric, which should be distinguished for truth, [...] "nothing could be more ridiculous than to have recourse to our Jupiters and Junos,"[22] and no incongruity of the kind could be more absurd than to couple Diana and Queen Anne. Windsor Forest was still in manuscript when Addison's essay appeared.
