He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E

Later, the Buddha allowed the ordination of women, forbade ordination to these other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> with exceptions to a few particular types of paṇḍaka. The Buddha's proscriptions against certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> joining the monastic sangha (ordained community) are often understood to reflect his concern with upholding the public image of the sangha as virtuous; in some cases, this is explicitly stated. Social acceptability was vital for the sangha, as it could not survive without material support from lay society.|$|E

She said she was persuaded by Eastwood's involvement, and the screenplay's depiction of Collins as someone who recovered from adversity and had the strength to fight the odds. Jolie found playing Collins very emotional. She said the most difficult part was relating to the character, because Collins was relatively passive. Jolie ultimately based her performance on her own mother, who died in 2007. For scenes at the telephone exchange, Jolie learned to roller skate in high heels, a documented practice of the period.|$|E
500|$|After {{development}} was finished, the team reflected {{that the fundamental}} part of a Super Mario game {{was to make the}} player think about how [...] "fun" [...] it was to play the game itself, rather than simply finishing it. To accomplish this, Koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of the game which could be enjoyed by all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> including children.

Iwata stated that when the first Super Mario game was released, there used to be [...] "many more" [...] people gathering around the television who would enjoy watching the gameplay experience.

While interviewing to direct, he insisted that the actors match {{the ages of the}} characters in the novel. Wright specifically cast actors that had rapport on and off screen, and insisted that they partake in three weeks of rehearsal in improvisation workshops. Wright also had to balance who he thought was best for each role with what the producers wanted – mainly a big name attraction. Though Wright had not initially pictured someone as attractive as English actress Keira Knightley for the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, he cast her after realising that the actress [...] "is really a tomboy [...] has a lively mind and a great sense of humour". Knightley at the time was known for Bend It Like Beckham and the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. She had been an Austen fan since age 7, but initially feared taking the role out of apprehension that she would be doing [...] "an absolute copy of Jennifer Ehle's performance", which she deeply admired. Knightley believed Elizabeth is [...] "what you aspire to be: she's funny, she's witty and intelligent. She's a fully rounded and very much loved character." [...] For the period, the actress studied etiquette, history and dancing but ran into trouble when she acquired a short haircut while preparing for her role in the bounty hunter film Domino.|$|E
