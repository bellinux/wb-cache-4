5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction.

5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> then rolled off an embankment and crashed.

That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, as <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> drives off.

50|$|Similar to <b>the</b> memory <b>bus,</b> <b>the</b> PCI and AGP buses {{can also}} be run asynchronously from <b>the</b> front-side <b>bus.</b> In older systems, these buses are {{operated}} at a set fraction of <b>the</b> front-side <b>bus</b> frequency. This fraction was set by the BIOS. In newer systems, the PCI, AGP, and PCI Express peripheral buses often receive their own clock signals, which eliminates their dependence on <b>the</b> front-side <b>bus</b> for timing.|$|R
