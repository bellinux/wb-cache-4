At first, 240 out of the total fresh laid eggs were divided into four experimental groups of approximately similar grades. Each group consisted of four replicates of 15 <b>eggs.</b> The <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> in group one (control group) were subjected only to the effect of the storage levels (1 -day, 7 -days, 14 -days, and 21 -days) at room temperature then hard-cooked, weight and peeled manually. The <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> in groups two, three, and four, in addition to the storage time were hard-cooked, weight and further subjected to the effect of 5 % hydrochloric acid, 1 % sodium hydroxide and combination of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide respectively. At all levels of the storage time and treatments the hard-cooked <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> were weighed and peeled manually. The peelability of each of the four egg groups was determined {{on the basis of a}} scoring system. The rest of the experimental eggs were graded and used to evaluate the role of egg size as a physical parameter on shell removal of hard-cooked <b>table</b> <b>eggs.</b> The results indicated that the peelability and the weight of the hard-cooked eggs were affected significantly by the different levels of the storage time. Hard-cooked eggs treated with acid alone and combination of acid with alkali showed the highest peeling scores during the different levels of storage time compared to the control group and alkali group. The alkali treatment showed low effect on the peelability of fresh laid hard-cooked eggs. This effect declined with storage time until zero effect was reached at 7 th day. Chemical treatments showed no effect on egg weight. There was no correlation between peelability and egg weight. The sensory evaluation of all experimental eggs scored moderately desirable and above, in all measured attributes. Egg size had no significant effect on hard-cooked <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> shell removal.

Therefore, their quality is a very important aspect for food safety and for public health. During a period of 6 months, samples of <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> were collected as it follows: 20 samples of each category of exploitation systems for laying hens (organic, free-range, aviary and cage production). Duplicates of the following examinations were performed: Roche index (10 samples/week); total content of proteins, lipids, water and ash (two samples/week); CFU/eggshell as well as presence of Salmonella in the contents using three different selective agar media (8 samples/week). From the total number of 480 samples of each category, results showed the following: for the Roche index, organic eggs were evaluated at 10 - 11, for free-range and aviary ones, values reached 13 and for cage production systems, 8 - 9. The content of proteins (%) was higher for free-range eggs (12. 48). The content in lipids showed high values for cage production eggs (11 %), but with close values for the other categories, reaching the minimum to 10. 7 % in aviary eggs. As for the water content, the highest value was observed for free-range eggs, and for ash the lowest value was observed for cage production eggs, while the highest for organic eggs. Microbiological quality of <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> revealed a significant bacterial load for the eggshell, of up to 5. 06 log CFU/eggshell for free-range eggs, and 5. 04 log CFU/eggshell for organic ones.

The survey involved 79 producers of table eggs registered in the Records on laying hens’ farms in the Republic of Croatia. In the first stage, the research defined the criteria and sub-criteria for system evaluation which were compared in pairs {{in order to determine}} the weight or importance for each of them. Alternatives were evaluation based on definition of priorities of examinees and the extent to which they meet each of the defined criteria and sub-criteria. Intensity of examinees’ preferences were entered into the Expert Choice software in order to evaluate ranking results of egg production systems. Defined model consisted of a quantitative criterion of economic indicators, and the other two referred to qualitative criteria, market indicators and technical-technological factors. Each criterion had its corresponding sub-criteria that were evenly distributed in numerical order. Based on individual assessments of the examinees, overall cumulative evaluation was obtained for the <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> production systems. Accordingly, the most acceptable alternative to egg production is the indoor keeping system (priority 0. 301). It is followed by the free-range system of keeping laying hens (priority 0. 253). The third-ranked alternative is egg production by hens kept in conventional cages (priority 0. 226), while the fourth-ranked least acceptable alternative, as of the total evaluation, is the ecological system of egg production (priority 0. 220). Taking into account the obtained results of multiple criteria evaluation as well as EU and world trends in changing consumers’ habits including food safety and quality as well as customers’ preferences towards local market and local products, it is recommended that eggs should be produced by laying hens kept in an indoor keeping system. In this sense, organized egg production on small farms in an indoor keeping system offers a possibility for self-employment serving as a source of additional income certainly has great potentials for development...|$|E

To determine this revenue impact, a vector error correction model (VECM) was defined and used to generate the counterfactual revenue during the time period the outbreak occurred. This counterfactual revenue was compared to the actual revenue observed during that time period and the difference is the revenue impact due to the outbreak, ceteris paribus. Additionally, machine learning algorithms, using residuals from the VECM, allowed us to determine causal relationships in contemporaneous time among the variables considered within the industry. The results from this study provide us with {{a better understanding of the}} <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> industry based on sound econometric modeling and provide a basis for conducting future revenue impact studies for similar events. Our model was developed using eight variables defined by previous studies including the number of hens and eggs, egg price, feed input prices, retail pork and beef prices, and real disposable personal income. After rigorous testing using RATS software, the vector error correction model for forecasting was identified with one lag and two cointegrating vectors. When the counterfactual revenue was compared to the actual revenue from December 2014 to June 2015, a gain of about $ 676 million to wholesalers was determined to be attributed to the outbreak. Additionally, residual analysis of contemporaneous relationships, as shown by directed acyclic graphs, indicated that egg price is independent of direct production quantities, hens and eggs, but is impacted by production costs such as feed input costs. These results can be accounted for by various factors including the inelasticity of egg price and the imperfectly competitive behavior of the wholesalers.

The 15 -state target population accounted for over three-quarters of the <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> layers in the U. S. as of December 1, 1998. The study was limited to companies with 30, 000 or more layer. About two-thirds (68. 1 percent) of farm sites did not allow visitors that did not have a business reason for visiting the operation in the layer houses. The percentage of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors in the layer houses did not differ by size of farm site. However, visitors {{were more likely to be}} required to sign in on farm sites of 100, 000 or more layers than on farm sites with fewer layers. About two-thirds (62. 9 percent) of farm sites that allowed non-business visitors required the visitors, vehicles not to have been on any other poultry farm that day. A total of 22. 9 percent of farm sites did not allow business visitors, such as a salesperson or feed service personnel, in the layer houses. The average usual down time between flocks ranged from 10. 5 days for farm sites in the Central region to 20. 4 days in the Great Lakes region. About one-third (35. 1 percent) of farm sites usually had a down time of 18 days or longer, while 8. 6 percent of farm sites usually had down time of less than 4 days. The median down time was 14 days. Over 98 percent of farm sites emptied feeders and 91. 3 percent emptied feed hoppers between flocks. About 80 percent each flushed water lines and dry cleaned cages, walls, and ceilings, while 71. 8 percent cleaned fans and ventilation systems between each flock.

40|$|SummaryWe {{report on}} an {{outbreak}} caused by Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 (PT 4) among 143 participants at a soccer camp in Austria in August 2010. The outbreak affected 34 persons, including 24 epidemiologically related cases and 10 laboratory-confirmed cases. Food-specific cohort analyses revealed spaetzle (homemade noodles) (relative risks (RR) : 2. 68; 95 % CI: 1. 13 – 6. 45), hamburger (RR: 2. 70; 95 % CI: 1. 13 – 6. 45) and potato salad (RR: 2. 91; 95 % CI: 1. 69 – 5. 02) {{as the most}} biologically plausible infection sources. Eggs used as ingredients {{were considered to be}} the vehicle of infection for the outbreak strain. The sole egg producer supplying the hotel that housed the soccer camp participants with <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> operated two flocks. One flock had been epidemiologically and microbiologically related to a previous S. enteritidis PT 4 outbreak affecting the same Austrian province in the four months preceding the August outbreak. We hypothesize that eggs from this flock, already condemned for industrial use only, were falsely declared <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> and sold among eggs from the non-banned flock causing the subsequent outbreak. In Austria, the illegal distribution of eggs designated for industrial use (i. e., false declaration of these <b>eggs</b> as <b>table</b> <b>eggs)</b> has been previously documented. Our findings underscore the potential of proper epidemiological outbreak investigation to identify the pitfalls of regulatory responses in risk management...|$|R
40|$|A Mix-ELISA using {{lipopolysaccharide}} antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis and Typhimurium {{was evaluated}} using samples collected {{over time in}} the Danish salmonella surveillance programme for poultry. Serological samples (n = 42, 813) taken from broiler-breeder flocks {{after a year of}} bacteriological monitoring with negative results were used for calculating the flock and individual test specificities, which were 0. 997 and 0. 999, respectively. Layer flocks from the <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> sector were used for calculation of positive predictive values. In the survey, flocks were examined for salmonella by Mix-ELISA and by faecal culture, and in case of a positive result in either of these a repeated, serological testing was performed, and 60 animals were organ-cultured. If one of these samplings was positive, the flock was declared salmonella infected. In a period of 3 months, 35 flocks were found to be positive in the routine samples. Of these, 32 were serologically positive, 2 both serologically and faecally positive and 1 flock only faecally positive. For flocks serologically positive in the surveillance programme, a positive-predictive value of 0. 62 for organ culture positivity was found, and while considering serological follow-up samples, the value was 0. 95...|$|E
40|$|The National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) is {{sponsored}} by the USDA:APHIS:Veterinary Services (VS). The NAHMS Layers ' 99 Study was designed to provide information about the nation's layer population for education and research purposes. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collaborated with VS to select a statistically-valid sample from 15 states for Layers ' 99. The 15 -state target population accounted for over three-quarters of the <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> layers in the U. S. as of December 1, 1998. The study was limited to companies with 30, 000 or more layers. While the majority of farm sites were contract farms (61. 0 percent), the majority of birds were located on company owned farms (72. 6 percent), indicating that company owned farms tended to be larger than contract farms. The Central region had the largest percentage (23. 0 percent) of farm sites with 200, 000 or more layers and also the largest percentage (40. 5 percent) of farm sites with fewer than 50, 000 layers. The vast majority of flocks (95. 6 percent) and layers (98. 8 percent) were white egg layers. (The New England states, which have a higher percentage of brown egg layers, were not involved in this study.) Almost two-thirds (61. 8 percent) of farms sites obtained all of their most recently placed pullets from a single pullet raising site, while 13. 6 percent of farm sites assembled their most recently placed flock from four or more different farm sites. The majority of farm sites (71. 3 percent) obtained all their replacement pullets from primarily cage reared facilities, although the majority of the farm sights in the Southeast region obtained pullets from primarily floor reared facilities. Layers on 69. 6 percent of farm sites came from pullet facilities that monitored for Salmonella enteritidis (S. e.) Ten percent of farm sites obtained replacement pullets from facilities that used competitive exclusion product in pullets to reduce S. e. Overall, 89. 0 percent of farm sites obtained pullets that had been vaccinated against fowl pox. On average, 3. 7 pounds of feed were needed to produce one dozen eggs. About two-thirds (67. 1 percent) of farm sites fed between 3. 0 and 3. 9 pounds of feed per dozen eggs produced. Contact for this paper: Lindsey Garber.

40|$|Peritonitis is {{the major}} disease problem of laying hens in {{commercial}} <b>table</b> <b>egg</b> and parent stock operations. Despite its importance, the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease have not been completely clarified. Although avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) isolates have been incriminated as the causative agent of laying hen peritonitis, Gallibacterium anatis are frequently isolated from peritonitis lesions. Despite recent studies suggesting a role for G. anatis in the pathogenesis of peritonitis, {{little is known about}} the organism’s virulence mechanisms, genomic composition and population dynamics. Here, we compared the genome sequences of three G. anatis isolates in an effort to understand its virulence mechanisms and identify novel antigenic traits. A multilocus sequence typing method was also established for G. anatis and used to characterize the genotypic relatedness of 71 isolates from commercial laying hens in Iowa and 18 international reference isolates. Genomic comparisons suggest that G. anatis is a highly diverse bacterial species, with some strains possessing previously described and potential virulence factors, but with a core genome containing several antigenic candidates. Multilocus sequence typing effectively distinguished 82 sequence types and several clonal complexes of G. anatis, and some clones seemed to predominate among G. anatis populations from commercial layers in Iowa. Biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobial agents was also observed in several clades. Overall, the genomic diversity of G. anatis suggest...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the contamination of enterovirulent Escherichia coli with <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> at Mansoura, Egypt. Materials and methods: A total of 100 commercially available <b>table</b> <b>eggs</b> were randomly collected from various groceries and supermarkets at Mansoura, Egypt. The samples were screened for the presence of E. coli through conventional bacteriological and biochemical analyses followed by confirmation by polymerase chain reaction. Results: Overall, 18 % (n= 18 / 100) samples were found to be contaminated with one or more E. coli isolates. All possible E. coli colonies (n= 52) appeared on MacConkey agar plates during the screening process were picked for further analysis. Among the 52 suspected isolates, 24 were confirmed as E. coli, which were further serotyped using polyvalent E. coli antisera. In this study, 9 different E. coli serotypes namely O 78, O 114, O 2, O 44, O 1, O 125, O 128, O 124 and O 26 were identified. Out of these 9 serological strains, 5 (O 78, O 2, O 44, O 125, O 124 and O 26) were positive for eae gene, and 3 (O 44, O 1 and O 128) were positive for stx 2 gene. Two serological strains (O 44 and O 1) were positive for both stx 1 and eae genes, while O 125 and O 114 were positive for stx 2 and eae genes. Two strains (O 78 and O 128) were found to be positive for all three genes (stx 1, stx 2 and eae).
