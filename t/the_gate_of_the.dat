5|$|In December 2011 the Zimbabwean artist, Parazai Havatitye, a {{sculptor}} who specialises in wood carving, created a sculpture {{from a tree}} stump, entitled The Musician, which {{is dedicated to the}} musician Johnny McEvoy, who was born in Banagher in 1945.

5|$|According to the chronicle, the Byzantines {{attempted}} to poison Oleg, but the Rus' leader demonstrated his oracular powers {{by refusing to}} drink the cup of poisoned wine. Having fixed his shield to <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imperial capital, Oleg won a favourable trade treaty, which eventually was of great benefit to both nations. Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, {{the text of the}} treaty survives in the Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed katkhuda (head of the Janissaries) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the Bab al-Muzayinīn (<b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barbers), so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the Bab al-Sa'ayida (<b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sa'idis), named for the Sa'idi people of Upper Egypt; and, several years later, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students. A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.|$|E

5|$|Dolmabahçe Palace, {{the seat}} of {{government}} during the late Ottoman period, {{is located in the}} Beşiktaş district on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The Sublime Porte (Bâb-ı Âli), which became a metonym for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (Bâb-ı Hümâyûn) at the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace; but after the 18th century, the Sublime Porte (or simply Porte) began to refer to <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sadrazamlık (Prime Ministry) compound in the Cağaloğlu quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) and other Viziers were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque on the Bosphorus, near the Bosphorus Bridge. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic yalıs, luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring road, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's main business districts.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1907 Iéna {{was moved}} into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo {{maintenance}} of her hull {{as well as}} inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of Iéna which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship , which was moored nearby, fired a shell into <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dry dock {{in an attempt to}} flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the sluice gates. The , moored in the No. 1 dock beside Iéna, almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, Radha's two {{surviving}} children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), {{are young}} men. Birju, embittered since childhood by {{the demands of}} Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's kangan (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal and its reddish water flows into the fields.|$|E

5|$|The 2/2nd Infantry Battalion, {{supported}} by the three Matilda tanks and the guns of the 7th Medium Regiment, advanced down the Wadi Scemmas towards an Italian fort on the southern headland of Bardia. After some hours of climbing, the 2/2nd reached the headland and attacked the fort at 1645. Inside the fort were two 6inch guns, two field guns and five other guns of the fort. Fortunately, the 6inch guns were for coastal defence and were unable to fire inland. One of the tanks made straight for <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort. The Italians opened the gate, and the tanks moved inside, taking the garrison of 300 prisoners. D Company then followed a goat track that led to lower Bardia. Thousands of prisoners were taken, most from service units. Two carriers of the 2/5th Infantry Battalion patrolling near the coast captured 1,500 prisoners. Captain N. A. Vickery, a forward observer from the 2/1st Field Regiment, attacked an Italian battery in his Bren gun carrier and captured 1,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The French gained {{access to}} the {{outermost}} ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men {{to look for a}} weak point in the castle. They {{gained access to}} the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20knights and 120other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, {{as was the case with}} the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.|$|E
