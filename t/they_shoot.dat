25|$|Skilled {{players can}} also hold {{a ball in}} place with the flipper, giving them more control over {{where they want to}} place the ball when <b>they</b> <b>shoot</b> it forward. This is known as trapping. This {{technique}} involves catching the ball in the corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper; the flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward against the flipper. The player then chooses the moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly against the flipper. Multi-ball games, in particular, reward trapping techniques. Usually this is done by trapping one or more balls out of play with one flipper, then using the other flipper to score points with the remaining ball or balls.|$|E
