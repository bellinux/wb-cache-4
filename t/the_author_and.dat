5|$|Cardinal Pole, {{the last}} Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, was vicar {{of the parish}} from 1532 to 1536. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> {{broadcaster}} Ralph Wightman (1901–1971) lived in Puddletown in the later years of his life; {{he lived in the}} 16th-century Tudor Cottage in The Square.

5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> <b>and</b> they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert brought suit, {{and after}} The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the {{performance}} rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy. Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> composer.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, {{legal action}} had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the {{partnership}} {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came {{through the efforts of}} Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, Carte produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was {{published}} by Random House.

In spite of his attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a Minnesota {{resident}} named Lyle Christiansen {{watched a}} television {{documentary about the}} Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was D. B. Cooper. After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.|$|E

5|$|June Kim, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily {{drew the}} artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears {{in black and}} white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|Kyoto held {{a year-long}} celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of Genji in 2008, with poetry competitions, {{visits to the}} Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size {{rendition}} of Murasaki at her desk was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court Jūnihitoe and ankle-length hair wigs. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin-offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.|$|E
5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent Motte a copy of Gulliver's Travels to be printed anonymously. Motte took great care to protect the identity of <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> <b>and</b> employed five publishing houses to speed production {{of the book and}} avoid unlicensed copying. In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, Motte paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E
5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead {{writes that}} the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that {{could be classified as}} true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel Wood of the University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. A study published by <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> illustrator Gregory S. Paul found that religious beliefs, including belief in creationism and disbelief in evolution, are positively correlated with social ills like crime. The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E
5|$|The Joker's {{popularity}} (and {{his role}} as Batman's enemy) has involved the character in most Batman-related media, from television to video games. These adaptations of the character have been received positively on film, television, and in video games. As in the comics, the character's personality and appearance shift; he is campy, ferocious or unstable, depending on <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>and</b> the intended audience.|$|E
