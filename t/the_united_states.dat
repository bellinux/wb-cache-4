5|$|In 1853, {{prior to}} the {{purchase}} of Alaska by <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy sent the USS Fenimore Cooper to the Aleutian Islands {{with the aim of}} locating potential harbors and find coal deposits. No coal deposits were found. In 1867, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire. By 1869, a number of military posts had been established by the Government of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> although the Aleutian Islands did not receive such a post, with the nearest post being located on Kodiak Island. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army made the decision to leave the exploration of the Aleutians to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy, and the latter showed little interest in doing so. The Aleutian Islands played a small role in the ongoing sealing dispute between the United Kingdom and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> which later culminated in the Bering Sea Arbitration. In 1888, following what <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Government saw as an infringement on the nation's sovereignty by Canadian and Japanese sealers, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Navy sent a number of its ships to Unalaska to police the foreign sealers.

40|$|This study evaluates {{impacts of}} land use changes due to human {{settlement}} on regional summer climate over the central and western <b>United</b> <b>States</b> by performing 30 -day simulations during normal, drought, and flood years. Under current land use the simulated evapotranspiration increased noticeably over <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> where grassland {{has been replaced by}} crops. Simulated evapotranspiration decreased slightly in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> These changes produced wetter and cooler surface air over <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and slightly drier and warmer air over <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Responses of surface fluxes and thus screen height variables to land use changes were consistent from year to year, whereas rainfall showed strong interannual variations because of the combination of various dynamic processes involved in precipitation. For normal year conditions, average evapotranspiration and rainfall under current land use increased by 18 % and 8 %, respectively, over <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> whereas they slightly decreased in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> In both flood and drought years, current land use exhibited a rainfall increase in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and a decrease over <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>The</b> decrease of rainfall with increased evapotranspiration in <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> <b>States</b> was likely associated with weakening of the dynamic forcing needed to produce precipitation...|$|R
