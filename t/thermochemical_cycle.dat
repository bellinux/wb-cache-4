40|$|Hydrogen is {{acclaimed}} to be {{an energy}} carrier of the future. Currently, it is mainly produced by fossil fuels, which release climate-changing emissions. <b>Thermochemical</b> <b>cycles,</b> represented here by the hybrid-sulfur cycle and a metal oxide based cycle, along with electrolysis of water are the most promising processes for ‘clean’ hydrogen mass production for the future. For this comparison study, both <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> are operated by concentrated solar thermal power for multistage water splitting. The electricity required for the electrolysis is produced by a parabolic trough power plant. For each process investment, operating and hydrogen production costs were calculated on a 50 MWth scale.

As a result, hydrogen production costs ranging from 3. 9 – 5. 6 V/kg for the hybrid-sulfur cycle, 3. 5 – 12. 8 V/kg for the metal oxide based cycle and 2. 1 – 6. 8 V/kg for electrolysis were obtained...|$|R

50|$|The sulfur-iodine cycle (S-I cycle) is a <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> {{processes}} which generates hydrogen {{from water}} with an efficiency of approximately 50%.

40|$|This paper reviews {{development}} {{in the field of}} solar thermochemical processing by considering experimental demonstrations, reactor technology development, thermodynamic, economic and life cycle analyses. The review then builds on these aspects and compares various solar thermochemical processes. Solar upgrading of carbon feed has been demonstrated on pilot scale. It is observed that for the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycles,</b> only iron and ceria based redox pair have been demonstrated on pilot scale. For industrial applications, solar thermochemical production of zinc, upgrading of landfill gas and organic waste have been demonstrated on pilot scale. However, long term performance data of these pilot plants is not reported in literature. Thermodynamic comparison reveals that the processes involving upgrading of carbon feed have energy and exergy efficiency at 50 - 90 % and 46 - 48 % respectively. Multistep <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> operating at 9001200 K have energy efficiency of 34 - 38 %. Metal oxide redox pair based <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> operating at 1900 - 2300 K have energy and exergy efficiencies of 12 - 32 % and 20 - 36 % respectively. Methane reforming and lime production processes have chemical efficiencies of 55 % and 35 % respectively and have demonstrated better performance than other solar thermochemical processes. A few processes like solar gasification of solid carbon feed have demonstrated lower chemical efficiency of around 10 % even at pilot scale. The hydrogen production cost for solar upgrading of fossil fuels is estimated at 3. 21 - 6. 10 $/kg and is lower than <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycles</b> at 7. 17 - 19. 26 $/lcg and CSP driven electrolysis at 3. 15 - 10. 23 $/kg. It is observed that there is limited actual data and significant uncertainty in cost. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that initial screening of processes be done by net energy, material and life cycle analysis. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The hybrid {{sulfur cycle}} (HyS) is a two-step water-splitting process {{intended}} {{to be used for}} hydrogen production.

5000|$|An {{advantage}} of the sulfur chemical element is its high covalence. Indeed, it can form up to 6 chemical bonds with other elements such as oxygen (e.g. sulfates), i.e. {{a wide range of}} oxidation states. Hence, there exist several redox reactions involving such compounds. This freedom allows numerous chemical steps with different entropy changes, and thus offer more odds to meet the criteria required for a <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> (cf. Principles). Most of the first studies were performed in the USA, as an example at the Kentucky University for sulfide-bases cycles. Sulfate-based cycles were studied in the same laboratory [...] and also at Los Alamos National Laboratory [...] and at General Atomics.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrogen}} world consumption {{should increase}} significantly to progressively replace hydrocarbons.

The chosen <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> for this study is the iodine-sulphur <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> water splitting. The process flowsheet under consideration has high total energy consumption. It has also many local energy needs unevenly distributed over a wide temperature range.

40|$|AbstractSolid {{particle}} {{heat transfer}} and storage media {{have been shown}} to be able to operate at temperatures > 1000 °C in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications, much higher than the operational limit of 600 °C for current state-of-the-art molten nitrate salt heat transfer fluid. Solid particles can be endothermically reduced by direct exposure to concentrated solar energy, thus absorbing and storing thermal energy beyond that possible with sensible heating alone. The particles can then be oxidized exothermically at a later time, releasing the stored chemical heat and effectively augmenting the thermal energy storage capacity of the solid particles. A mixed metal oxide spinel material that reduces in the temperature range of interest (1000 - 1200 °C) has been examined for applicability to this thermochemical energy storage concept. A description of this application, prospective materials, and details of the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> are presented.

In addition another novel proposal for a <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> has been studied. For the description of the theoretical potential for economic competitivness, a definition of the "coupling", has been introduced, which is thermodynamicaly developed; the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>cycle</b> is compared with the thermomechanical cycle.

Reasons are given from the theoretical point of view for the application of hydrogen as an energy carrier of high exergetic value in the heat market. The discussion of energy problems as "questions of global survival" leads here to a proposal for the introduction of the term "extropy".
