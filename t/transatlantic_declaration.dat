50|$|Taking the {{existing}} interparliamentary relationship as its basis, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) aims to strengthen {{and enhance the}} level of political discourse between European and American legislators. It does so {{against the background of}} the numerous other contacts that have resulted in a significantly closer EU-US relationship at a variety of levels. These include, namely, the annual EU-US Summit meetings established by the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 1990, the Transatlantic Dialogues (Business, Consumers, Environment, and Labour) and other initiatives.|$|E
5000|$|On August 11, 1952, the US {{became the}} first {{non-member}} state to recognize the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was formed on 23 July and consisted of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The following year, the US sent observers to the ECSC, at which point diplomatic relations with the ECSC were established. A formal diplomatic mission to the ECSC opened {{in the city of}} Luxembourg in 1956. In 1961, the United States Mission to the European Communities was established in Brussels, Belgium. The European Communities was the collective term for three supernational European agencies established in the 1950s—the ECSC, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Economic Community (also known simply as the European Community [...] )—which were merged in 1967 into a body also known as the European Communities (EC). The EC had limited foreign policy roles, primarily consisting of trade relations, which were carried out by the European Political Cooperation (EPC), established in 1970. Relations between the US and EC were formalized through the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> in 1990.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} make an original contribution to knowledge about transatlantic institutions and transatlantic governance. It investigates attempts in the 1990 s to foster a 'new transatlantic dialogue' between the EU and the US, through three bilateral agreements: the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> (1990), the New Transatlantic Agenda (1995) and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (1998). The thesis questions whether and to what extent the relationship has been institutionalised into a structure for transatlantic governance, and how the composition of transatlantic institutions impacts the way the transatlantic actors govern. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations and 'how', as evidence is sought to prove or disprove the claim that a decentralisation of decision-making powers has resulted in 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors participating in transgovernmental and transnational institutions. Three policy sectors-the EU-US anti-trafficking in women campaigns, the EU-US Mutual Recognition Agreements and the EU-US banana dispute-serve as case studies for the transatlantic policy process...|$|E
40|$|The Master Thesis European union as a Trade actor: the {{dynamics}} of the EU-US relations between 1991 and 1998 is concerned with the European Unions trade relations with the United States in the period of 1991 and 1998. The author critically analyzes European Unions integration and effectiveness in the area of external trade relations in the 1990 s. Furthermore, the author scrutinizes the allocation of trade competence among the EU institutions at international trade negotiations and its effectiveness in achieving the European trade interests. Using the example of <b>transatlantic</b> business <b>declarations</b> the author points out how the European trade policy towards the United States evolved in the 1990 s and what its major concerns were. Finally, the author analyzes the EU-US trade disputes put forth in the World Trade Organisation until 1998...|$|R
40|$|The 1990 <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> and the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) {{established}} the basic structural {{link between the}} United States and the European Union, instituting numerous bilateral meetings at several levels and defining the substantive scope of U. S. -EU interaction. For almost a decade, the "NTA process" has been central {{to the creation of}} a comprehensive and regular transatlantic dialogue. Yet, for several years, there has been a significant element of frustration among observers of the NTA, to whom it often seems that the process has come to dominate the substance. Some of the major non-govenmental elements of the NTA have fallen into inactivity, and those that remain, the business and legislative dialogues, have struggled to remain relevant. Much of the government-to-government interaction has been dominated by the need to produce "deliverables" on a laundry list of issues. Perhaps most frustrating, the NTA process, even when running relatively smoothly, has clearly not reduced the overall level of transatlantic tension, as is made evident by the current bout of the US. -European discord-one of the worst in years...|$|E
40|$|In its {{examination}} of bilateral Canada-European Community (EC) relations since 1957, this dissertation tests two hypotheses: that the Canadian foreign policy process is predominantly state-led; and that given Canada's relative power capability {{in the immediate}} post-Cold War period (1989 - 1993), it faced considerable constraints in not only its broader foreign policy choices but specifically {{with regard to the}} EC "pillar" of its European foreign policy framework. This study's overview of the history of bilateral Canada-EC relations, its analysis of the Canadian government's interests in the negotiations leading to the 1990 EC-Canada <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> and the Canadian response to the Single European Market, highlight a watershed - starting in 1989 and lasting four years - in Canada's post-Second W orld War intemational relations. It was during this period that Ottawa was forced to make a fundamental reassessment not only of the value of its traditional Atlanticist foreign policy orientation but also the relative value of the three "pillars" (NATO, CSCE, and the EC) that upheld this approach. The dissertation concludes by outlining the choices available to Canadian decision makers at the end of 1993, as they sought to use Canada's bilateral relationship with the Community to reconfigure transatlantic economic, political and security relations...|$|E
40|$|From the 1990 <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> (TAD) to the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda and Joint Action Plan (NTA/JAP), {{this paper}} argues that {{nothing short of}} a {{revolution}} occurred {{in the nature of the}} dialogue between the United States and the European Community. The change was from a high-ideological political manifesto to a common program for practical action, embodied in the JAP's 150 action items [...] from a summons to transatlantic solidarity in the aftermath of the Cold War to what former U. S. Secretary of State James A. Baker has described, with mixed admiration and disapproval, as a "laundry list. " Three main explanations for this major transformation of the Atlantic dialogue are offered. The first is "the failure of grand designs" [...] the inability of American and European statesmen to find a replacement project for the formerly supreme task of winning the Cold War. The second is the increased prominence of the business community, notably the members of the new Transatlantic Business Dialogue, in determining even U. S. and European officials' work agenda. The third is the rapid, vast spread of information technology, notably use of the Internet, which has so broadened the transatlantic dialogue today as to risk taking it largely out of the hands of diplomats. The NTA/JAP, in short, is a powerful engine of diplomatic change. In promoting it, U. S. and European Union government officials may have helped to promote themselves out of a job. The NTA/JAP can now grow almost organically, from the bottom up. If it does continue to proliferate and flourish, the political leaders of the Atlantic world may find that they have expressed themselves in a way that defines the limits of their own leadership, and opens space for a new idea of Atlantic citizenship...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hailed by President Clinton as the "roadmap for the 21 st century", the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) and the Joint Action Plan (JAP) were {{designed}} to be a watershed in US-EU relations. Rooted in the revolutionary changes of the late 1980 s/early 1990 s, the US and the EU realized that they were entering the uncertainty of a new and unprecedented political era - the post-Cold War world - which called for a fundamental overhaul of transatlantic relations. It quickly became obvious that the political dialogue between the two needed to be reinvigorated and incorporate a wider area of policy objectives. Ergo, it was necessary {{to move away from the}} ad hoc consultations common during the Cold War, and cope with issues which were formerly for the most part unilaterally dealt with by the United States. Only a few years after the first attempt of strengthening transatlantic ties culminated in the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 1990, policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic realized that further cooperation was called for. At the US-EU summit in Madrid on 3 December 1995, President Bill Clinton, Spanish Prime Minister and President of the EU Council Felipe Gonzalez, and European Commission President Jacques Santer announced a New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) and a Joint Action Plan (JAP) to forge even closer ties between the United States and the European Union by implementing coordinated policies on a range of the most pressing economic, political, security, humanitarian, environmental and cultural issues. The initiative was a concise plan laying out concrete action plans to cope with today's interdependent world in which challenges facing the United States and the European Union could no longer be dealt with satisfactorily by either party acting alone. Transnational in nature, these challenges, such as international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, environmental degradation and the spread of communicable diseases, required resources which exceeded those at the disposal of either the US or the EU acting alone. In particular, the two sides promised joined actions to work towards the following four goals: (I) promoting peace and stability and fostering democracy and development around the world (II) responding to new global challenges (III) contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations (IV) building social and cultural bridges across the Atlantic. Based on the Agenda, the Joint Action Plan is a more comprehensive document which contains 150 longer-term specific objectives from which a number are selected for regular updating of the Agenda between subsequent US-EU summit meetings. The following assessment explores the origins of the Agenda in general and the overall state of transatlantic relations during the 1990 's in particular. Furthermore, each policy area is discussed and evaluated from an American and European point of view. Lastly, potential points of friction are examined and a prospect for bringing the Agenda to fruition will be undertaken...|$|E
