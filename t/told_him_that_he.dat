5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree.

5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jean-Pierre Lafitte {{defeated}} Bob Holly {{in a standard}} dark match. In the weeks preceding the event, the WWF ran a competition to win a house in Orlando, Florida. Todd Pettengill and Stephanie Wiand showed footage {{of the home and}} later hand-picked one of the entries. They phoned Matt Pomposelli of Henderson, Nevada and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his family had won the vacant home. The home was officially presented to Pomposelli on the May 22 episode of Raw.|$|E

It was there <b>that</b> <b>he</b> discovered a direct interest in spiritualism after visiting medium Brian Hurst, who upon meeting Van Praagh <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a medium {{and that the}} spirit world would assist him in [...] "changing {{the consciousness of the}} planet.” ...|$|R

5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food {{and spent most of}} the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four {{in three months}} in sixty battalions; by his reckoning, this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By {{this time in the}} war, his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Shero was {{introduced}} to his future wife, Mariette, by his teammate Eddie Johnston in Shawinigan Falls, Quebec. Mariette was the sister of a woman Johnston was dating, at the time. Johnston recalled that Shero <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to marry}} Mariette after their first date, which he did shortly thereafter. Fred and Mariette had two sons, Rejean (Ray) and Jean-Paul. Ray Shero also pursued a career in hockey and is the current general manager of the New Jersey Devils.|$|E

60|$|He {{pretended to}} be very angry, and to take it very ill; but the other <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> came {{to him for a}} {{character}} of the man, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> honestly, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would give no characters at all, that it was not for any ill to his neighbour <b>that</b> <b>he</b> declined it, he ought to have believed him; and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped, when he wanted a character of any of his neighbours again, he would not come to him for it.|$|R

5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was not going}} to make another Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a lot from them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of rehab he {{recovered}} earlier than expected. His 2008–09 season started on 25 November, as Gradi gave him a start at the Walkers Stadium, where Leicester City won 2–1. The next month he played six games, keeping four clean sheets (against Carlisle United, Cheltenham Town, Swindon Town and Millwall). However he attracted criticism from his manager {{at the end of}} January following heavy defeats to Northampton Town and Peterborough United, and was subsequently dropped. New manager Gudjon Thordarson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not be offered a new contract {{at the end of the}} season, thus ending Tomlinson's long association with the club.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E

5|$|Having {{returned}} to active military duty, Middleton {{was assigned to}} a training regiment at Camp Wheeler, Georgia where he was quickly promoted to colonel on 1 February, and oversaw the combat training of thousands of recruits. After less than two months, {{he was given a}} rapid succession of assignments, including to Camp Gordon, Georgia and Camp Blanding, Florida. While at Blanding he was called to the War Department in Washington, where he was given an assignment to be a staff officer in London, but this rapidly changed when he was subsequently called to the War College, and met a classmate from Command and General Staff School, Brigadier General Mark Clark, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being assigned to the Forty-fifth Infantry Division at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing {{and it was not}} as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to}} die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{had some}} {{difficulties}} with the cast. To save money, he sought not to hire George Takei and Nichelle Nichols. He neglected to inform Leonard Nimoy {{of this and}} instead, {{in an effort to}} get him to sign on, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the only member of the main cast not returning. After Nimoy discovered the deception, he demanded that Takei and Nichols play Sulu and Uhura when their characters appeared on screen; Roddenberry acquiesced. He had been promised five full seasons of the new show, but ultimately, only one and a half were produced.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer did not {{submit to}} Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats {{on behalf of}} Hearst to expose the private lives of people {{throughout}} the entire film industry. Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress Dolores del Rio, who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized. In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst. Hearst began preparing an injunction against the film for libel and invasion of privacy, but Welles's lawyer <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doubted Hearst would proceed due to the negative publicity and required testimony that an injunction would bring.|$|E
50|$|Bill Gates {{tried to}} recruit a {{reluctant}} Allchin to join Microsoft {{for a year}} and successfully convinced him in 1990. Gates <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> whatever <b>he</b> created would have a wider customer base through Microsoft than anyone else.|$|R

5|$|Cooper {{earned a}} Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and {{enrolled}} at Harvard Law School later that year. During the summer break of 1924, {{he returned to}} Kentucky, where his father, dying of Bright's disease, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would soon become {{the head of the}} family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s. Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs. He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa. Kirchner took part in a commission to investigate money laundering with fellow legislator Elisa Carrió, and got into conflicts with her. She ran again for senator in the 2001 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
