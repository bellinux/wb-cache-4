40|$|The haemodynamic, {{metabolic}} {{and regional}} blood flow {{effects of the}} vasodilator, <b>tolmesoxide</b> (1 mg kg- 1 min- 1 for 20 min by intravenous infusion) were examined in two groups of greyhound dogs anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose and mechanically ventilated. One group of dogs was thoracotomized and subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion. In these dogs <b>tolmesoxide</b> was infused 2. 5 h after occlusion when there was evidence of impaired myocardial function. <b>Tolmesoxide</b> administration resulted in marked systemic hypotension which was associated with myocardial stimulation (increase in heart rate and LVdP/dtmax). These effects were less marked in thoracotomized dogs subjected to coronary artery occlusion. Cardiac stimulation was attenuated by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol. Peripheral resistance and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were reduced by <b>tolmesoxide.</b> In spite of the systemic hypotension, the marked reduction in LVEDP resulted in an enhanced subendocardial driving pressure and an increased blood flow to ischaemic regions of the left ventricular wall as measured with Xe 133 clearance. Blood flow to normal regions of the left ventricular wall was also increased by <b>tolmesoxide.</b> A metabolic and respiratory acidosis {{may have contributed to}} the haemodynamic effects of <b>tolmesoxide.</b> Plasma renin levels were significantly elevated by the drug. <b>Tolmesoxide</b> administration thus resulted in cardiac stimulation, reduced both pre-load and after-load, yet maintained coronary and pulmonary perfusion. This haemodynamic profile of <b>tolmesoxide</b> would explain the beneficial effects obtained with this drug in the treatment of cardiac failure...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The haemodynamic {{response}} and phar-macokinetics of single dose oral <b>tolmesoxide</b> were studied at various dose levels in 4 patients with severe hypertension. There was a reproducible fall in {{mean arterial pressure}} from baseline of 24. 2 % and a rise in heart rate of 37. 6 % following administration of tol-mesoxide. The onset of antihypertensive action oc-curred within 1 h, with a peak effect at 3 h after dosing. The mean duration of action was up to 12. 0 h. Tol-mesoxide had a mean half-life of 3. 0 h. It was rapidly absorbed with a mean peak plasma level occurring at 1. O h. Plasma levels correlated well with the doses ad-ministered. Side-effects included mild nausea, facial flushing and postural symptoms. Key words: <b>tolmesoxide,</b> vasodilator, hypertension...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tolmesoxide,</b> {{a potent}} vasodilating compound, was infused {{intravenously}} (0. 5 to 3. 5 mg/kg b. w., rate of infusion: 2. 5 to 10. 0 mg/min during 7 [...] 25 min, 2 or 3 successive infusions {{separated by a}} 30 min rest period) in 7 hypertensive patients. An abrupt fall in blood pressure and heart rate occurred in 4 patients whereas 2 patients exhibited almost no hemodynamic response. The remaining case suffering from renovascular hypertension responded with a progressive dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure. No obvious correlation could be demonstrated between the drug plasma levels (ranging between 1. 0 and 11. 1 microgram/ml) and the hemodynamic effects among the 7 patients studied.
