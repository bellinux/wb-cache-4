50|$|A {{standard}} tetrapolar <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> {{has four}} round metal pins and one plastic pin. The design is only used in Belgium for telephone wiring. It {{is similar to}} the tripolar <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> of Italy and also the Swedish <b>telephone</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Danish <b>{{telephone}}</b> <b>plug</b> is {{the special}} flat round <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> used in Denmark for POTS (analog) telephone lines and some [...] "raw copper" [...] (for ADSL etc.) telephone lines. The plug has 3 flat pins arranged {{at right angles}} to each other. This plug is used in few if any other places in the world, and most equipment now made uses the US/International RJ11 socket on the device end and includes either a cable with the Danish <b>Telephone</b> <b>Plug</b> at the wall end, or a standard RJ11 to RJ11 cable with a bundled Telephone Adapter.|$|E

50|$|TeleAdapt {{was founded}} in 1992 by Gordon Brown. The name TeleAdapt is a {{portmanteau}} of telephone and adapter, as the company started by providing telephone adapters to business travellers. According to Brown, he was inspired to start the company after spotting {{a gap in the}} telecommunications market, and subsequently compiled the first complete list of foreign <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Protea <b>telephone</b> <b>plug,</b> {{sometimes}} called simply the South African <b>telephone</b> <b>plug,</b> was {{widely used in}} South Africa from the 1960s or 1970s until the 1990s. As of 2004, new telephone installations in South Africa use RJ11 plugs (which are sometimes referred to in South Africa as Venus plugs), but Protea plugs are still often encountered in older installations.|$|E

50|$|This list covers only {{single line}} <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs</b> {{commonly}} used in homes and other small installations; there are 44 different variations of plugs, including an Israeli version of BS6312 with different internal wiring of the pins, plus hard wiring to a junction box with no adapter. Special telephone sets {{use a variety of}} special plugs, for example micro ribbon for key telephone systems.|$|R
50|$|When simple {{on-premises}} wiring is color-coded, two-wire <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs</b> or {{the first}} pair of a multi-pair connector commonly have the tip wire coded green and ring coded red. In four wire plugs, the second pair has black tip and yellow ring. A third pair consists of white tip and blue ring. For larger cable assemblies more complex schemes such as the 25-pair color code are used.|$|R
5000|$|Residential {{telephone}} {{production was}} shifted back to North America in 1993 when AT&T opened established a subsidiary in Mexico {{and built a}} telephone plant. As a result, [...] "WE" [...] markings on modular <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs</b> were replaced with [...] "HHE" [...] or [...] "ECI", marking the end of any Western Electric branding whatsoever on any part of an AT&T telephone. In 1994, AT&T discontinued production of the Princess telephone.|$|R
50|$|The telefonic {{tripolar}} plug is {{the first}} type of <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> used in Italy. It has also been used in Turkey in older installations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{telephone}} jack of manual telephone switchboards, {{which is the}} socket fitting the original 1/4" [...] <b>telephone</b> <b>plug.</b> This open-frame, open-circuit accepts 1/4" [...] mono phone plugs.|$|E
50|$|The plastic pin adds a {{presence}} function. When not inserted into a jack, the jack itself (mechanically) connects the incoming {{line to the}} next socket. The article on the Swedish <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> details its functional principles.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, {{the terms}} jack plug and jack socket are {{commonly}} used for the respective male and female phone connectors. In the US, a stationary (more fixed) electrical connector is called a [...] "jack". The terms phone plug and phone jack are sometimes {{used to refer to}} different genders of phone connectors, but are also sometimes used colloquially to refer to RJ11 and older <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs</b> and the corresponding jacks that connect wired telephones to wall outlets.|$|R
50|$|Modular {{connectors}} {{were developed}} to replace older telephone installation methods that used either hardwired cords, or bulkier varieties of <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs.</b> The common nomenclature for modular connectors includes the number of contact positions {{and the number of}} wires connected, for example 6P indicates a six-position modular plug or jack. A six-position modular plug with conductors in the middle two positions and the other four positions unused has the designation 6P2C. RJ11 uses a 6P2C connector. The connectors could be supplied with more pins, but if more pins are actually wired, the interface is not an RJ11.|$|R
50|$|Tip {{and ring}} are {{the names of}} the two {{conductors}} or sides of a telephone line. The terms originate in reference to the <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs</b> used for connecting telephone calls in manual switchboards. One side of the line is connected to the metal tip of the plug, and the second is connected to a metal ring behind the tip, separated and insulated from the tip by a non-conducting material. When inserted into a jack, the plug's tip conductor connects first, followed by the ring conductor. In many European countries tip and ring are referred to as the A and B wires.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separate}} keyboard with 114 keys {{connected to}} the main unit using a reversed British <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> with the clip on the left hand side. Most monitors were amber monochrome but later colour screens were sold.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in {{some other}} countries, this <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> was {{introduced}} long before any liberalization of the telephone market occurred. Until the mid-1980s, all legal telephone equipment with this plug was rented, purchased or at least approved from the regional telephone companies or (rarely) the government.|$|E
50|$|The Telebrás plug {{is the old}} Brazilian <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> and socket system. It uses a large plug (about 4 cm x 4 cm) with 2 flat metal pins + 2 flat plastic pins. Three of {{the pins}} have the same {{orientation}} and the fourth pin being rotated 90 degrees to {{make it impossible to}} plug in the wrong orientation.|$|E
5000|$|Military {{aircraft}} and civil helicopters have another type termed a U-174/U. These are also termed 'NATO plugs' or Nexus TP120 <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs.</b> They {{are similar to}} [...] in (6.35 mm) plug, but with a 7.10 mm diameter short shaft with an extra ring, i.e. four conductors in total, allowing two for the headphones (mono), and two for the microphone. There is a confusingly similar four pole (or four conductor) British connector with a slightly smaller diameter and a different wiring configuration used for headsets in many UK Military {{aircraft and}} often {{also referred to as}} a NATO or 'UK NATO' connector.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, El Hortelano put on {{his first}} solo show {{entitled}} [...] "Moda" [...] (Fashion), where he displayed the 4-panel endpiece from his book of cartoons, Europa Requiem, which depicts the four seasons {{as seen in the}} subway. The exhibition brought together drawings and canvases featuring fanciful designs based on airline gear, flying costumes, and complex characters with bodies of televisions, <b>telephones,</b> <b>plugs,</b> light bulbs, spirals, and watches. It opened at the René Metrás Gallery in Barcelona in spectacular fashion. El Hortelano, sporting a sea-bass for a tie, was wheeled into the packed room on a hospital bed by Ouka Leele and a friend dressed as nurses, accompanied by a siren blaring from an ambulance they had hired. The spectacle made the newspapers the following day.|$|R
40|$|The {{world of}} {{communication}} is rapidly changing, mainly {{due to the}} advancement of technology. No longer is the <b>telephone</b> <b>plugged</b> in or the mail sent with a stamp, instead wireless and electronic communication has replaced these traditional methods. As these advanced communication methods become more accessible, and the need for computer technology implementation in the classroom grows, so does the need for devising new strategies for their effective usage. This literature review will draw from the works of Dewey and Vygotsky to show how social interaction is a crucial factor in cooperative learning. I will focus on the adaptation of computer based communication tools, Instant Messaging and Chat room, in the classroom, as new mediums by which students will be able to communicate and cooperate with one another in order to accomplish a given task...|$|R
5000|$|The 3-pronged Danish <b>Telephone</b> <b>Plug</b> is a {{simplified}} {{form of an}} older 5 pronged plug, where the two extra pins (vertical, above and further apart than the signal pins) connected to a customer premises long life battery that provided power for telephones before the introduction of [...] "automatic dialing" [...] (the ability to place calls without operator assistance).|$|E
50|$|A <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> {{is a type}} of {{connector}} used {{to connect}} a telephone set to the telephone wiring inside a building, establishing a connection to a telephone network. It is inserted into its counterpart, a telephone jack, commonly affixed to a wall or baseboard. The standard for telephone plugs varies from country to country, though the RJ11 modular connector has become by far the most common.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} Swedish <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> carries one {{telephone line}} and has four flat metal pins and one plastic pin. The design is only used in Sweden and older installations in Iceland (RJ11 and a data/voice standard using an 8P8C modular connector {{are used in}} more recent buildings). Neither plug nor socket is compatible with other plugs and sockets. It is defined in Swedish Standard SS 455 15 50.|$|E
50|$|The company {{founded on}} the idea of old <b>telephone</b> {{handsets}} <b>plugged</b> into cellphones but soon diversified, adding voice over IP applications. Whilst Pokia handsets were modded existing designs, Hulger handsets are newly commissioned products, created specially for use. In late 2005 two Bluetooth models allowed wireless use with both cellphones and PCs/Macs.|$|R
50|$|STU-III is {{a family}} of secure {{telephones}} introduced in 1987 by the NSA {{for use by the}} United States government, its contractors, and its allies. STU-III desk units look much like typical office <b>telephones,</b> <b>plug</b> into a standard telephone wall jack and can make calls to any ordinary phone user (with such calls receiving no special protection, however). When a call is placed to another STU-III unit that is properly set up, one caller can ask the other to initiate secure transmission. They then press a button on their telephones and, after a 15-second delay, their call is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. There are portable and militarized versions and most STU-IIIs contained an internal modem and RS-232 port for data and fax transmission. Vendors were AT&T (later transferred to Lucent Technologies), RCA (Now L-3 Communications, East) and Motorola.|$|R
50|$|The {{window of}} {{economic}} advantage in metal injection molded parts lies in complexity and volume for small-size parts. MIM materials {{are comparable to}} metal formed by competing methods, and final products are used in {{a broad range of}} industrial, commercial, medical, dental, firearms, aerospace, and automotive applications. Dimensional tolerances of ±0.3% are common and machining is required for closer tolerances. MIM can produce parts where it is difficult, or even impossible, to efficiently manufacture an item through other means of fabrication. Ideally, at least 75 dimensional specifications in a component of just 25 mm maximum size and 10 g mass is best - as for example required for watch cases, cellular <b>telephone</b> <b>plugs,</b> and laptop computer hinges. Increased costs for traditional manufacturing methods inherent to part complexity, such as internal/external threads, miniaturization, or identity marking, typically do not increase the cost in a MIM operation due to the flexibility of injection molding.|$|R
50|$|F-010 or T plug or PTT plug {{is a type}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> and {{matching}} socket. The F-010 standard originated in France and is used there (overseas departments and territories included) and in other countries, including Algeria, Andorra, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Comoros, Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Grenadines, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Monaco, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Togo and Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|Computer {{ports in}} common use cover {{a wide variety}} of shapes such as round (PS/2, etc.), {{rectangular}} (FireWire, etc.), square (<b>Telephone</b> <b>plug),</b> trapezoidal (D-Sub — the old printer port was a DB-25), etc. There is some standardization to physical properties and function. For instance, most computers have a keyboard port (currently a Universal Serial Bus USB-like outlet referred to as USB Port), into which the keyboard is connected.|$|E
50|$|MEO's {{technology}} transmits over {{fiber optic}} and ADSL - either television (IPTV), telephone (VOIP) and internet. MEO ADSL integrates a router with a switch, {{connected to the}} <b>telephone</b> <b>plug</b> to decode and distribute the signal, and another for the television called MEOBox. The two MEOBox models are built by Motorola and Scientific Atlanta, with a processor, optional hard drive, HDMI slot, two SCART slots, a digital sound slot and an Ethernet slot.|$|E
5000|$|Unwanted {{calls to}} {{landline}}s may be blocked {{through a number}} of methods. Some landline phones have built-in call blocking facilities. External call blockers are sold as <b>telephone</b> accessories which <b>plug</b> into existing phones.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} years of the 1900s, the GPO (subsequently British Telecom) did have a plug and socket system {{available}} for rent (see Plate 3 in the 1909 edition of the Post Office Telegraphs [...] "Connections of Telephonic Apparatus and Circuits" [...] 1909 edition). It was later called a [...] "Plan 4" [...] (N762—first edition), and employed a heavy-duty, four-way jack plug 404 (circular in cross-section), on the end of the standard, plaited, cotton-covered instrument cord. It also had to have a separate bell-set, which was permanently in-circuit to provide ringing if there were no <b>telephones</b> <b>plugged</b> in. This system survived through various models of telephones from the [...] "candlestick" [...] 200 and 300 type bakelite phones until the introduction of the 700 series in 1959, when a smaller [...] "Plug 420" [...] was introduced. The separate bell-set, with its on-board capacitor and coils, also provided a testing circuit for remote engineers, by providing the mandatory 1000 ohm capacitive loop-back. Rental had to be paid on each telephone and on all the sockets, and hence the system was not that common.|$|R
50|$|The terms tip {{and ring}} {{originated}} {{in the early days}} of telephony when <b>telephone</b> operators used <b>plugs</b> to connect customer calls. They are named after the parts of the plug to which the wires were connected. The words are often abbreviated as T and R.|$|R
