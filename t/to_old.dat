40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} National Ageing Policy 2003 on free health services provision <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people. It specifically identified the health services which are freely provided <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people and {{those which are}} not freely provided. The study adopted an evaluation research design with a sample size of 60 respondents whereas 30 of them were obtained through purposive sampling technique and 30 were obtained through simple random sampling technique. Interview, questionnaire and observation were used to collect primary data. Documentary review was also used in searching various facts. Indeed both qualitative and quantitative were used. The general objective {{of the study was}} to assess the National Ageing Policy 2003 on provision of free health services <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people in Tanzania. On the other hand specific objectives were: to examine the extent at which free health services are provided <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people, <b>to</b> explore the understanding of implementers on National Ageing Policy 2003, to examine economic factors that hinder accessibility to free health services provision among the <b>older</b> people and <b>to</b> assess the bureaucratic processes that affect effective provision of free health services <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people. The study revealed that the objective of providing free health services <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people aged 60 years and above as it was stated in the National ageing policy 2003 is not yet met. Findings show that the common health services which are provided freely are consultation, laboratory test and very rarely required medicine. In this aspect, there are recommendations such as policy dissemination, sufficient fund allocation for policy implementation and training to health services providers concerning health services provision <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people...|$|R

5|$|Paddington {{became an}} {{important}} milk depot {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. A milk dock was built 1881, and by the 20th century over 3,000 churns were being handled at the station every day. Other goods such as meat, fish, horses and flowers were also transported through Paddington. Passenger traffic continued to improve as well. In March 1906, the goods depot at Westbourne Park was moved <b>to</b> <b>Old</b> Oak Common. The main departure platform was extended in 1908 and used for milk and parcels. In 1911, work began to separate light and empty carriage traffic from running trains between Paddington <b>to</b> <b>Old</b> Oak Common, which involved the rebuilding of Westbourne Park station. The work was halted because of World War I but resumed in 1926, to be completed the following year. Three new platforms were added; platform 12 in November 1913, platform 11 in December 1915, and platform 10 the following year. The roof was completely reconstructed between 1922 and 1924, replacing Brunel's original cast-iron columns with steel replicas.|$|E
