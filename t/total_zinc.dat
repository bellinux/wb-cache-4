50|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is common}} in {{many different types of}} soil; some soils (sandy soils, histosols and soils developed from highly weathered parent material) have low <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> concentrations, and others have low plant-available zinc due to strong zinc sorption (calcareous soils, highly weathered soils, vertisols, hydromorphic soils, saline soils). Soils low in organic matter (such as where topsoils have been removed), and compacted soils that restrict root proliferation also have a high risk of zinc deficiency. Application of phosphorus fertilizers has frequently been associated with zinc deficiency; {{this may be due to}} enhanced sorption by clay minerals (especially iron oxides), suppression of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae and/or immobilization of zinc in plant tissues. Liming of soils also frequently induces zinc deficiency by increasing zinc sorption.|$|E

Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether substitution of biofortified maize (34 mg zinc/g grain) for control maize (21 mg zinc/g) was adequate to meet zinc physiologic requirements in young children for whom maize was the major food staple. A secondary objective was to compare <b>total</b> daily <b>zinc</b> absorption when maize flour was fortified with zinc oxide to a total concentration of 60 mg zinc/g. Methods: Participants included 60 rural Zambian children with a mean age of 29 mo who were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 maize types (control, biofortified, or fortified) all of which were readily consumed (> 100 g on 1 d). <b>Total</b> daily <b>zinc</b> intake (from maize and low-zinc relish) was determined from duplicate diet collections.

Until now, however, mainly pork meat is used for these investigations. The goal of this research was to relate in vitro zinc protoporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX formation in eight meat sources (chicken, turkey, pork, lamb, beef, veal, horse and porcine liver) to eight intrinsic parameters using partial least squares regression (PLS) analysis. Significant differences in pH, initial metmyoglobin formation, metmyoglobin reduction ability, <b>total</b> heme, <b>zinc</b> chelatase activity, and <b>total</b> iron and <b>zinc</b> concentration between meat sources were found. Water activity, however, was not significantly different between meat sources. Liver tissue and horse meat showed the best ability to form zinc protoporphyrin IX. Formation of protoporphyrin IX was limited in all meat sources. PLS analysis revealed that mainly zinc chelatase activity, followed by total heme, <b>total</b> iron and <b>zinc</b> content, were predominant intrinsic parameters to explain variations in zinc protoporphyrin IX formation.

Wilson discovers that between 1990 and 1996 Bay Zinc took in roughly one and a half million pounds of lead, eighty-six thousand pounds of chromium, and nineteen thousand pounds of nickel. However, Wilson notes that Bay Zinc is relatively small in comparison to Alabama-based Frit Industries, the leader, which connected one its major factories to Nucor Steel. Together eight companies process 120 million pounds of industrial byproducts into fertilizer, roughly half of the <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> fertilizer sold in the country (157). Wilson says this trade is facilitated by state industrial material exchanges (IMEX) and that twenty-six states have them.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient that is important for beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that zinc intake could influence the glucose-raising effect of specific variants. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We conducted a 14 -cohort meta-analysis to assess the interaction of 20 genetic variants known to be related to glycemic traits and zinc metabolism with dietary zinc intake (food sources) and a 5 -cohort meta-analysis to assess the interaction with <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> intake (food sources and supplements) on fasting glucose levels among individuals of European ancestry without diabetes. RESULTS-We observed a significant association of <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> intake with lower fasting glucose levels (beta-coefficient +/- SE per 1 mg/day of zinc intake: - 0. 0012 +/- 0. 0003 mmol/L, summary P value = 0. 0003), while the association of dietary zinc intake was not significant. We identified a nominally significant interaction between <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> intake and the SLC 30 A 8 rs 11558471 variant on fasting glucose levels (beta-coefficient +/- SE per A allele for 1 mg/day of greater <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> intake: - 0. 0017 +/- 0. 0006 mmol/L, summary interaction P value = 0. 005); this result suggests a stronger inverse association between <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> intake and fasting glucose in individuals carrying the glucose-raising A allele compared with individuals who do not carry it.

In a pilot study of children whose general nutrition ranged from adequately nourished to moderately malnourished, mean hair zinc was 135 ug/g (63 - 230 ug/g), with suboptimal zinc status suggested for 44 %. Predictors of hair and serum zinc levels were explored for 23 school-aged and 40 preschool children. Included in models were weaning age for preschool children, body size (length- or height- and weight-for-age Z scores), current growth over 6 months or longer, illness experience over 10 to 12 months, demographic variables affecting food availability and distribution, sex, and season.

Results showed no difference in hair zinc levels by color, presence or absence of louse egg fragments and mucilage, or presence or absence of henna dye. In multiple regression models, the best predictor of hair zinc in preschool children was season of year, with zinc lower in summer.

After 80 and 175 days, columns were sacrificed and each cm from the top down to a depth of 15 cm was sampled. Earthworm casts, placed on top of the soil, were collected. Each sample was analyzed for total and CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations. Effects of earthworm bioturbation were most pronounced after 1, 75 days. For A. chlorotica, total and CaCl 2 -exchangeable zinc concentrations in the polluted layers were lower with than without earthworms. <b>Total</b> <b>zinc</b> concentrations in the non-polluted layers were higher in columns with earthworms. Casts of A. chlorotica collected on the soil surface showed slightly higher <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> concentrations than non-polluted soil. Casts were found throughout the whole column. For A. caliginosa there were no differences in <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> concentration between columns with and without earthworms.

Fractional absorption was signif-icantly higher for the breast-fed infants (0. 40 6 0. 21) compared with the formula-fed group (0. 13 6 0. 06) (p 5 0. 01), but with the significantly higher dietary zinc intake of the formula-fed group, <b>total</b> absorbed <b>zinc</b> was higher for those receiving formula (p 5 0. 01). In 11 infants with complete zinc metabolic data, excretion of endogenous zinc was twofold greater for the formu-la-fed infants (p, 0. 05); net absorption (mg zinc/d) was nega-tive for both feeding groups: 20. 04 6 0. 52 for breast-fed; 20. 28 6 0. 57 for formula-fed.

Concentrations in direct inflow of three parameters: <b>total</b> <b>zinc</b> (x = 0. 24 mg/L, IQR = 0. 12 - 0. 34), TSS (240 mg/L, 176 - 356), and BOD (59. 7 mg/L, 42. 4 - 77. 8) were higher than delayed inflow (x = 0. 04 mg/L, 36 mg/L, and 23. 7 mg/L, respectively). Concentrations of delayed inflow were similar to or lower than dry-weather flow. Pollutant concentrations for particulatebased pollutants were much higher during the direct inflow phase of rain events compared to the delayed inflow phase. Dissolved-phased nutrients, however, were not different...|$|E
50|$|Secondary zinc {{smelters}} produce zinc {{from recycled}} materials. A secondary zinc smelter in Pennsylvania closed in 2014, the operations being shifted {{to a new}} smelter in North Carolina using solvent extraction/electrowinning (SX/EW). In addition, some non-smelting zinc recycling operations produced small amounts of <b>zinc.</b> The <b>total</b> amount of <b>zinc</b> produced from secondary operations was 70 tons. For primary and secondary smelters taken together, recycled products accounted for 52 percent of the refined zinc produced in US in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Abnormalities {{of taste}} and smell were studied in 29 {{patients}} after head trauma. These abnormalities included decreased taste acuity (hypogeusia), a distortion of taste acuity (dysgeusia), decreased smell acuity (hyposmia), and a distortion of smell acuity (dysosmia). This syndrome can occur even after minimal head trauma and can begin months after the moment of injury. The patients exhibited {{a significant decrease in}} <b>total</b> serum <b>zinc</b> concentration (patients, 77 ± 3 μg/ 100 ml, mean ± 1 SEM, vs controls, 99 ± 2 μg/ 100 ml, P> 0 · 001) and a significant increase in total serum copper concentrations (113 ± 4 μg/ 100 ml vs 100 ± 2 μg/ 100 ml, P< 0 · 001) compared with control subjects. Symptoms of hypogeusia, dysgeusia, and dysosmia are frequent sequelae of head injury and are important to the patients and to their care after trauma...|$|R
30|$|Zinc, an {{essential}} trace element, {{has long been}} recognized as an important player in the biosynthesis, processing and secretion of insulin (Li, 2014). During exocytosis, zinc is co-secreted with insulin into the extracellular space and can be transported back into β-cells and neighboring cells (Franklin et al., 2005). Moreover, perfusing pancreatic islets and MIN 6 cells (a pancreatic β-cell line) with stimulating levels of glucose or KCl drastically increases the rate of zinc transport into the cytosol (Gyulkhandanyan et al., 2006). In addition, in diabetes, pancreatic zinc levels are reduced by approximately half compared to levels in the non-diabetic pancreas (Scott and Fisher, 1938). In contrast, rats fed a zinc-deficient diet have reduced serum and <b>total</b> pancreatic <b>zinc</b> levels, but normal zinc levels in pancreatic islets of Langerhans (Sondergaard et al., 2006). Although several studies have investigated zinc levels in pancreatic islets, how zinc homeostasis is regulated under physiological and pathological conditions remains unclear.|$|R
