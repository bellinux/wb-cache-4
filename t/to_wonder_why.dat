25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E

Both were {{conscious}} by the time rescuers arrived, but Victor was convulsing with seizures. One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and decontamination procedures were started. The bed of the truck was full of plastic containers of chemicals; some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone.|$|E

Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well {{deep in the heart of}} the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost.

As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more than she could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E

Huntley speculates on the [...] "interesting" [...] possibility of a whole LP side of similar [...] "ersatz country and western" [...] tracks, as the Rolling Stones would do on their Exile on Main St. double album in 1972.

500|$|... "Left & Right" [...] is a funky party jam {{featuring}} rappers Method Man and Redman, who exchange verses as D'Angelo {{sings the}} song's verses and chorus. Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna {{put my finger on}} the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 23, 2014, Marvel and Wright jointly {{announced}} that Wright {{was leaving the}} project due to [...] "differences in their vision of the film", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On the split, Wright said, [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} Marvel movie but I don’t think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie." [...] He also added that at one point, Marvel wanted to do a draft of the script without him, which was [...] "a tough thing to move forward" [...] as Wright has written all of the previous films he directed. Wright continued, [...] "Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you’re sort of less emotionally invested and you start <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> you’re there, really." [...] The majority of Wright's crew also left the project {{in the wake of his}} departure. By May 30, Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright, but pulled out of negotiations the next day. On June 7, Marvel {{announced that}} Peyton Reed would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script. Other directors that had been under consideration include Ruben Fleischer, Rawson Marshall Thurber, Nicholas Stoller, Michael Dowse, and David Wain.|$|E
500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves. Mohammad Raed, a Sunni Muslim, is the [...] at school, who prefers playing sports and fooling around with his friends to studying.

500|$|The film's {{reception}} was mixed, review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} rating of 55%, based on a sample of 221 reviews; the site's consensus reading [...] "It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better," [...] for comparison, Wall Street (1987) had achieved a 78% positive rating. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News awarded it five out of five stars {{saying that it is}} a sharp sequel that is worthy of its investment. He also saluted the cast's performance and noted that Douglas gives Gekko [...] "uncounted layers as he fakes, deals and fuels fire". Matthew Toomey of Australia's 612 ABC Radio Brisbane gave it a B-rating and said that Douglas is the film's [...] "biggest positive", finding LaBeouf to be unconvincing in his role. Christy Lemire, in The Canadian Press, claimed that the film ultimately [...] "goes soft and loses its way" [...] and described the contrast in its final scenes as being [...] "laughable". Furthermore, the subplot between LaBeouf and Mulligan's characters as unneeded and pointed out that their relationship leads viewers <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> Winnie, who despises Gekko, would be involved with a man who does exactly the same thing as him, which she condemns; however, Lemire acknowledged that the movie is an uncommon sequel that seems to be both relevant and necessary and said that it proves that [...] "greed can still be good". Film critic Colin Newton of the Brisbane Sunday Mail felt that the plot lacked the enthusiasm of the first film. Along the same lines, Village Voice contributor Nick Pinkerton pointed out that the Wall Street sequel did not have the [...] "clean, fable-like arc" [...] formula of its predecessor.|$|E

All of this had surfaced deep emotions in Don. Also in this episode, Don has jokingly stated he was a [...] "lost cause," [...] when his father expressed a failure in parenting him.

In March, Warners announced that The Jazz Singer was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently). In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric's licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, a musical crime melodrama. On September 27, The Jazz Singer became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The movie [...] "created a sensation", according to British film historian Rachael Low.

2500|$|In 1930, Lindbergh's {{sister-in-law}} {{developed a}} fatal heart condition. Lindbergh began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> hearts {{could not be}} repaired with surgery. Starting in early 1931 at the Rockefeller Institute and continuing during his time living in France, Lindbergh studied the perfusion of organs outside the body with Nobel Prize-winning French surgeon Dr. Alexis Carrel. Although perfused organs {{were said to have}} survived surprisingly well, all showed progressive degenerative changes within a few days. Lindbergh's invention, a glass perfusion pump, named the [...] "Model T" [...] pump, is credited with making future heart surgeries possible. In this early stage, the pump was far from perfected. In 1938, Lindbergh and Carrel described an artificial heart in the book in which they summarized their work, The Culture of Organs, but it was decades before one was built. In later years, Lindbergh's pump was further developed by others, eventually leading to the construction of the first heart-lung machine.|$|E
