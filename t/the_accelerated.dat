25|$|If {{the walls}} of <b>the</b> <b>accelerating</b> {{cavities}} are made of normally conducting material and <b>the</b> <b>accelerating</b> fields are large, the wall resistivity converts electric energy into heat quickly.

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with <b>the</b> <b>accelerated</b> program.|$|E
