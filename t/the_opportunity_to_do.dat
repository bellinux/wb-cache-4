5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 {{season was}} the 132nd {{in the history}} of the franchise. After a disappointing 2013, the Phillies entered the offseason with a {{strategy}} to reload rather than rebuild; they did not want to relinquish <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in 2014 in hopes of being competitive down the road. Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were right fielder Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.|$|E

After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to trade him Cape Fear for <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier, and Pemper.

Having found <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of}} the musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opposition}} in the fourth round were Italian side Roma. The first leg was held at Roma's home ground the Stadio Olimpico, where Liverpool had won the European Cup twice in 1977 and 1984. Incidentally, Roma were the team Liverpool beat to win the European Cup in 1984. Liverpool were once again successful at the Stadio Olimpico, as they won 2–0 courtesy of two Michael Owen second half goals. The second leg at Anfield was a close affair. Roma scored in the 70th minute to take the lead, they now needed to score another goal to take the match into extra-time. They looked like they had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, when the referee awarded a penalty {{towards the end of}} the match after he had adjudged that Markus Babbel had handled the ball. However, moments later, he reversed his decision and instead awarded Roma a corner-kick. Roma were unable to score the necessary goal following the incident and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E

Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life.

50|$|In September 2016, Bills coach Rex Ryan used Patulski's name as an alias when {{he posed}} as a {{reporter}} for The Buffalo News at a press conference for New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. The practical joke led the News to commission a guest column from the real Patulski following the Bills' win over the Patriots on October 2. The News then profiled Patulski a month later, in which his relatively disappointing career was largely blamed on two factors: he was in an unusually weak draft class, and his quiet personality clashed with the style of Bills coach Lou Saban. Patulski never spoke to Saban again after his football career ended, despite <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R

30|$|The {{categories}} of students that groups of teachers {{use to describe}} and discuss their students inform {{the ways in which}} teachers’ actions are contingent on the work they see their students engaging in. These categories reveal clues about the features of student activity that teachers respond to and the possibilities for student action that are supported by teachers (Horn, 2005, 2007). In particular, research has shown that groups of teachers who discuss their students in dynamic and flexible ways also provide increased <b>opportunities</b> for students <b>to</b> learn (Horn, 2005). By exploring the ways in which teachers talk about students’ actions while they are making conjectures, we hope to uncover the aspects of students’ work that teachers respond <b>to</b> and <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> mathematical work that teachers create for students.|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty is a {{double-edged}} sword for the planner. Without it, society's need for strategic planning would be much reduced, but its existence is often {{at the root of}} much of the criticism which public perceptions of the planning profession induce. In this paper it is argued that not only is the need to take proper account of uncertainty greater than ever before, but so too are <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in practice. Three aspects of the uncertainty question are analysed. How should uncertainty be characterised within the planning process? What influence should the presence of uncertainty have on evaluation procedures? How should plan design respond to the presence of uncertainty? It is concluded that increasingly the required formal techniques and computational capacity are available: planners must be sure to use them to good effect. ...|$|R

25|$|Seth Kaplan (2011) {{argues that}} in {{contrast}} to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa {{because it has been}} largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} leadership, moral integrity, {{and difficulties}} in ensuring moral integrity in leadership. The chapter advances the following arguments: (1) It does matter how is in charge, and {{the available evidence}} does not unequivocally support the objections to this view. (2) The personal qualities that matter in leaders include moral integrity. (3) Some of the processes that determine access to positions of leadership are insufficiently sensitive to relevant personal characteristics. (4) In particular, the top-down or bureaucratic processes that exist in many organizations {{are less likely than}} bottom-up processes to eliminate leadership candidates with moral flaws. The authors argue that moral integrity in leadership matters because of <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> immense harm available to those who occupy leadership positions. Lack of moral integrity in a leader is thus of far greater consequence than lack of conscience, self-control, or tolerance in any private citizen acting alone...|$|R
