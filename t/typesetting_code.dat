50|$|Although the {{specification}} {{was based}} upon the 7-bit ASCII character set, some characters were declared {{to be replaced by}} traditional newspaper characters, e.g. small fractions and <b>typesetting</b> <b>code.</b> As such, it was a bridge between older typesetting methods, newspaper traditions and newer technology.|$|E
50|$|Monospaced fonts are {{customary}} on typewriters and for <b>typesetting</b> computer <b>code.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Scantext 1000 system {{comprised}} a CPU {{with multiple}} 8" [...] disk drives, keyboard and monitor, the latter dispaying coordinates and codes defining a page layout. The left-hand drive {{was intended for}} recording document data; the second for required font data. In the early years, no preview was available, the operator seeing only <b>typesetting</b> <b>codes</b> (“working blind”). Later, a non-interactive (green) monochrome preview display was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Released in 1975, the Compuwriter IV holds two filmstrips, each holding four fonts (usually Roman, Italic, bold, {{and bold}} Italic). It {{also has a}} lens turret which has eight lenses giving {{different}} point sizes from the font, generally 8 or 12 sizes, depending on the model. Low-end models offer sizes from 6- to 36-point, while the high-end models go to 72-point. The Compugraphic EditWriter series took the Compuwriter IV configuration and added floppy disk storage on an 8-inch, 320 KB disk. This allows the typesetter to make changes and corrections without rekeying. A CRT screen lets the user view <b>typesetting</b> <b>codes</b> and text.|$|R
50|$|Early {{electronic}} typesetting {{programs were}} designed to drive phototypesetters, most notably the Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter that troff was designed to provide input for. Though such programs still exist, their output is no longer targeted at any specific form of hardware.Some companies, such as TeleTypesetting Co. created software and hardware interfaces between personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and phototypesetting machines which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines.With the start of desktop publishing software, Trout Computing in California introduced VepSet, which allows Xerox Ventura Publisher {{to be used as}} a front end and wrote a Compugraphic MCS disk with <b>typesetting</b> <b>codes</b> to reproduce the page layout.|$|R
40|$|Pretty-printing a {{piece of}} Pascal code with TEX is often done via an {{external}} preprocessor. Actually, the job can be done entirely in TEX; this paper introduces PPP, a Pascal pretty-printer environment {{that allows you to}} <b>typeset</b> Pascal <b>code</b> by simply typing Pascal (Pascal code) endPascal. The same approach of "preprocessing within TEX" [...] namely two-token tail-recursion around a FIND-like macro [...] can be applied easily and successfully to numerous other situations...|$|R
50|$|The PDP-8 was {{designed}} {{in part to}} handle contemporary telecommunications and text. Six-bit character codes were in widespread use at the time, and the PDP-8's twelve-bit words could efficiently store two such characters. In addition, a six-bit teleprinter code called the teletypesetting or TTS code was in widespread use by the news wire services, and an early application for the PDP-8 was <b>typesetting</b> using this <b>code.</b> Later 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit UTF-8 character codes were developed in part {{as a response to}} the limitations of five- and six-bit character codes.|$|R
40|$|This {{bibliography}} contains {{references to}} the geologic literature on the State of Minnesota issued from 1981 through 1985, as well as omissions from the previous two bibliographies of Minnesota geology: Bulletin 34 (published in 1951), with coverage through 1950; and Bulletin 46 (published in 1981), with coverage for 1951 - 1980. The references in the bibliography section cover most geologic topics but exclude those confined to the last 10, 000 years, to surface hydrology, and to mining and metallurgy. Most unpublished maps and reports were excluded from this bibliography, {{because they are not}} readily available to users. Notable exceptions are theses and dissertations and open-file reports issued in established and accessible series, such as the U. S. Geological Survey's Open-File Report series. An effort was made in the bibliography section to preserve the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation of the original sources; usage in the index reflects current Minnesota Geological Survey style. The last bibliography, Bulletin 46, covered 30 years. Bulletin 47 covers only 5 years, but contains nearly 1, 100 references, more than half the number in its predecessor. Much of this inflation may reflect the increased number of abstracts published in recent years. The next bibliography (for 1986 - 1990) will differentiate between abstracts and more substantive work. The index section, with a few minor changes, closely follows the design of the index in Bulletin 46. It has in one alphabetical listing topical (Ground Water; Petrology; Sedimentation), geographic (Mesabi range; Lake County; Southwestern Minnesota), lithostratigraphic (Duluth Complex; Lake Vermilion Formation), and chronostratigraphic (Paleozoic; Quaternary) indexing. Care was taken to index {{references to the}} closest applicable index classifications. For this reason, users of the index are encouraged to search flexibly, to check both broader and narrower index classifications. For example, someone wanting references for Aitkin County may also wish to search a narrower index classification-Cuyuna range, as well as the broader East-central Minnesota. The increased number of cross references in this index should help users with this type of search. Several of the Survey staff were especially helpful in the preparation of the index, and also reviewed the entries in their respective fields: M. J. P. Kuhns and S. J. Mills (economic geology and Duluth Complex); P. L. McSwiggen (petrology and uranium); H. C. Hobbs (glacial geology); and D. J. Bergstrom (Paleozoic rocks and Sioux Quartzite). V. W. Chandler reviewed the geophysics entries; D. R. Setterholm, Cretaceous rocks; R. S. Lively, geochemistry and geochronology; and M. C. Hoyer, ATES. Linda McDonald typed and updated the bibliography through most of its existence. Denise Fletcher typed the index and inserted the <b>typesetting</b> <b>codes.</b> J. F. Splettstoesser proofread the final typescript...|$|R
40|$|The FLAME project advocates {{representing}} matrix algorithms, whether <b>typeset</b> or in <b>code,</b> at {{the same}} level of abstraction that is used to explain such algorithms on a chalk board. While this has allowed us to modernize development of libraries with functionality that includes the level- 3 BLAS and much of LAPACK, performance has been an issue for algorithms that cast most computation in terms of level- 1 and level- 2 BLAS. We show how this can be overcome with a source-to-source transformer that takes a representation that uses the FLAME/C API as input and yields code in a more traditional style (indexed loops and direct calls to BLAS routines). Impressive performance is demonstrated even when level- 2 BLAS kernels are implemented in terms of optimized level- 1 BLAS kernels. Thus, developers can finally fully embrace these new abstractions and tools for the development of linear algebra libraries. ...|$|R
40|$|The examplep package {{written by}} the author {{recently}} provides sophisticated features for <b>typesetting</b> verbatim source <b>code</b> listings, including the display of the source code and its compiled LATEX or METAPOST output side-by-side, with automatic width detection and enabled page breaks (in the source), {{without the need for}} specifying the source twice. Special care is taken so section, page and footnote numbers do not interfere with the main document. For typesetting short verbatim phrases, a replacement for the command is also provided in the package, which can be used inside tables and moving arguments such as footnotes and section titles. The listings package is used for syntax highlighting. The article reviews the design decisions made during the package development and also presents some interesting implementation internals. examplep is compared to standard LATEX packages such as listings, ltxdoc, sverb and moreverb. The new codep package and its accomanying Perl script, which provide a convenient interface to the examplep package for authors of manuals, is also presented. With codep it is possible to generate the source code, the LATEX or METAPOST output and the compilable example file onto the CD from a single source embedded into the appropriate place of the. tex document file. ...|$|R
