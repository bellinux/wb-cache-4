When his ethics issues were made public, Rangel remarked that Governor of Alaska and Republican {{vice presidential nominee}} Sarah Palin was [...] "disabled." [...] In 2013, he compared the Tea Party movement to segregationists who opposed the Civil Rights Movement and said they could be defeated the same way: [...] "It is the same group we faced in the South with <b>those</b> <b>white</b> crackers and the dogs and the police. They didn't care about how they looked. It was just fierce indifference to human life that caused America to say enough is enough." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's Your News?, which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could only say phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all <b>those</b> <b>white</b> women felt", but he had no problem repeating it. The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates, including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears, were inspired by things Parker drew during high school.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{a group of}} [...] "modernisers" [...] emerged within the party who favoured a move towards a more electorally {{palatable}} strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They focused on community-based campaigning among the white working-class populations of London's East End, {{an area in which}} many of them lived. Utilising the slogan [...] "Rights for Whites", this involved playing to anxieties regarding neighbouring immigrant and ethnic minority communities. They also called for similar tactics to be employed in <b>those</b> <b>white</b> working-class communities in Northern England which were adjacent to Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, and for the party to promote rural issues to gain traction in the countryside.|$|E

The reason {{they moved to}} Beltway was because they wanted bigger houses for their families. Beltway was the furthest from downtown Chicago and the most isolated out of the other 3 cities.|$|R

5000|$|In the past, ancestry {{was quite}} {{irrelevant}} for racial classifications in Brazil. A survey in Rio de Janeiro also concluded that [...] "racial-purity" [...] {{is not important}} {{for a person to}} be classified as white in Brazil. The survey asked respondents if they had any ancestors who were European, African or Amerindian. As much as 52% of <b>those</b> <b>whites</b> reported they have some non-European ancestry: 38% reported to have some Black African ancestry and 29% reported Amerindian ancestry (15% of them reported to have both). Only 48% of <b>those</b> <b>whites</b> did not report any nonwhite ancestry. Thus, in Brazil, one can self-identify as white and still have African or Amerindian ancestry, and such a person has no problem admitting to having nonwhite ancestors.The most recent census in 2010, showed a shift in mentality, where mixed Brazilians overwhelmingly chose to identify with their mixed racial background, rather than white.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the center of her house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn <b>those</b> <b>white</b> cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{practices}} {{were accompanied by}} a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing {{in the yard and}} facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name someone like that from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with something even more appalling that was allegedly present in their village. For example: [...] "Back! Back, ala! Here is a bigger ala, beware!" [...] or [...] "Hey, do not go, prodigy, on prodigy! We have a huge prodigy: here a girl bore a girl, a girl of nine years old! Do not go, prodigy, on prodigy: we have a huge prodigy!" [...] These texts often contained the idea of hail clouds as cattle, usually white: [...] "OSava and Nevena, turn back <b>those</b> <b>white</b> cattle! There is no pasture for them here! We only have ashes to put their eyes out!" [...] Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind. (Sava and Nevena were a couple who drowned themselves in the Morava River for not having been allowed to marry.) Saint John and Saint Sava also appeared as leaders of cattle/clouds: [...] "Saint Sava, turn back your cattle from our village!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, most male African American {{soldiers}} still {{served only}} as truck drivers and as stevedores (except for some separate tank battalions and Army Air Forces escort fighters). African American {{women in uniform}} answered {{the call of duty}} by tending the wounded as nurses, or working as riveters, mail clerks, file clerks, typists, stenographers, supply clerks, or motor pool drivers. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies. These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked [...] "very well" [...] and 16% were ranked [...] "fairly well". [...] No black platoon received a ranking of [...] "poor" [...] by <b>those</b> <b>white</b> officers or white soldiers that fought with them. [...] Unfortunately, these platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. [...] Despite their protests, these brave African American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. [...] Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.|$|E

Whiteness, the characteristic that distinguishes them from blacks, serves as compensation even to those who lack material wealth.
