40|$|The Selective Equipment Removal System (SERS) was {{previously}} developed under the Department of Energy`s Robotics Technology Development Program to demonstrate and evaluate mobile telerobotic concepts for performing selective dismantlement using the reconfigurable dual-arm work module (DAWM). DAWM {{was designed for}} overhead <b>transporter,</b> <b>crane</b> hook, and mobile vehicle deployment. The DAWM configuration provided two 6 -degree-of-freedom (D. O. F.) hydraulic manipulators with a maximum capacity of 240 lbs in the elbows-up configuration and five additional D. O. F. supplying torso rotate for the entire positioning package, linear extension of each arm base, and base rotate for each arm (which added a seventh D. O. F. to the manipulator for elbows-up, elbows-out, and elbows-down operation). Hydraulic manipulators were selected to provide the payload capacity required for anticipated tooling and material handling needs that would be typical of heavy dismantlement tasks. The original design of the dual arm manipulation system was driven {{by the desire to}} provide maximum system versatility in the study of deployment options and orientation relative to specific task performance. In FY 1996, the program was directed to provide remote systems support for the dismantlement of the CP 5 reactor at Argonne National Lab (ANL) beginning in FY 1997. A study of the tasks involved and the available deployment options led to a rework of the DAWM designated the dual arm work platform (DAWP), which was specifically designed around crane hook deployment, reduced the base D. O. F. `s to four instead of five, and made use of the existing DAWM control system. This paper describes the evolution of the DAWM into the DAWP and the design philosophy involved...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, shipyards {{are making}} huge effort to {{efficiently}} manage equipments and {{resources such as}} laborers, gantry <b>cranes,</b> <b>transporters,</b> steel and block stock yards, etc. Previously scheduling was manually performed by an experienced manager of a shipyard. But such a scenario leads to undesirably long times for producing scheduling results. In addition, {{the quality of the}} scheduling results was usually not optimal. To improve the overall process, Discrete Event Simulations (DES) have been developed and recently use in shipbuilding industry. The use of simulation-based design and virtual reality technologies leads to higher efficiency in terms of work strategy planning, and offers, as a result, significant productivity gains. It gives computer-supported answers to the major questions: when and where to produce what and with which resources depending on the availability and restrictions of resources and materials. The first part of the paper presents a multi-criteria analysis to select the most appropriate DES software for shipyards. Then, {{the second part of the}} paper shows production simulation model focusing on block erection stage. Two different blocks splitting are compared and then the results are discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{concerning the}} application of multi-agent based simulation for evaluating container terminal management operations. The growth of containerization, i. e., transporting goods in a container, has created problems for ports and container terminals. For instance, many container terminals are reaching their capacity limits and increasingly leading to traffic and port congestion. Container terminal managers have several, often conflicting goals, such as serve a container ship {{as fast as possible}} while minimizing terminal equipment costs The focus of the research involves the performance from the container terminal managerâ€™s perspective and how to improve the understanding of the factors of productivity and how they are related to each other. The need to manage complex systems such as container terminals requires new ways for finding solutions, e. g., by applying novel methods and technologies. The approach taken in this thesis is to model the decision makers involved in the container terminal operations and various types of terminal equipment, e. g., <b>cranes,</b> <b>transporters,</b> etc., as software agents. The general question addressed in this work is: can the performance of a container terminal be improved by using agent-based technologies? In order to evaluate the multi-agent based systems approach, a simulation tool, called SimPort, was developed for evaluating container terminal management policies. The methods for modelling the entities in a container terminal are presented along with the simulation experiments conducted. The results indicate that certain policies can yield faster ship turn-around times and that certain stacking policies can lead to improved productivity. Moreover, a multi-agent based simulation approach is used to evaluate a new type of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) using a cassette system, and compare it to a traditional AGV system. The results suggest that the cassette-based system is more cost efficient than a traditional AGV system in certain configurations. Finally, an agent-based approach is investigated for evaluating the governance structure of the stakeholders involved in a transport corridor. The results of the research indicate that the performance of a container terminal can be improved by using agent-based technologies. This conclusion is based upon several studies, both conceptual and concrete simulation experiments. In particular, multi-agent based simulation seems to offer container terminal management a suitable tool to control, coordinate, design, evaluate and improve productivity...|$|R
