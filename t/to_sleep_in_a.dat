25|$|In March 1929, Cliff White and Cyril Paris, {{two local}} extreme sports enthusiasts, created {{a plan to}} use the CPR cabin as an {{overnight}} point in their ski trek over the great divide. Unfortunately they {{could not find the}} cabin that night and were forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dug-out in the snow. Upon waking in the morning they discovered that they had only just missed the CPR cabin. These two men were the first to ski what is now known as Sunshine Village.|$|E

500|$|By 1904 the War Office had {{concluded}} that Walmer had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castle to the Office of Works, who accepted it {{on the condition that}} they were paid £2,400 in order to carry out repairs. The Office's survey noted that [...] "the lower floor ... is very inconvenient, dark and not conducive to health while the women servants have <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sort of dormitory in the slopes of the roof... The principal floor is, generally speaking, badly arranged and badly lighted and the Dining Room is very small"; the report suggested that {{it would be best to}} demolish the building and rebuild it.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrets spend 14-18 {{hours a day}} {{asleep and}} are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular. Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily <b>in</b> social groups. <b>A</b> group of ferrets is {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "business". They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enclosed area.|$|R

"Because {{he finds}} food among the natural trees," [...] replied Kaliko, [...] "and I {{remember}} that he has built a little house there, <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in.</b> <b>As</b> for these glittery golden trees, I will admit they are very pretty at first sight. One cannot fail to admire them, {{as well as the}} rich jewels scattered beneath them; but if one has to look at them always, they become pretty tame." ...|$|R
500|$|According {{to reports}} in the 1870s, intense rain, malaria, {{pneumonia}} and dysentery caused many deaths. During this time the authorities also embarked on testing of pharmaceutical drugs like quinine (cinchona alkaloid) by forcibly feeding it to 10,000 prisoners which resulted in severe side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and depression; as result the prisoners started injuring each other so that authorities would hang them. Instead, {{a new system of}} [...] "flogging and a reduced diet" [...] was introduced and they were made <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kind of [...] "trellis-work cage". The prisoners also faced hardships from the indigenous tribes, some of whom were cannibals, who tortured and killed them while working in the field, and also attacked the colony.|$|E
500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Meanwhile, {{he walked to the}} local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look up at the sky and when you see a cloud think of me".|$|E
500|$|... "Magic Alex" [...] (Greek-born Alex Mardas, who {{controlled}} Apple Electronics) arrived later, smuggling in alcohol {{from the nearest}} village as it was not allowed in the ashram. After two weeks Lennon asked <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but {{walked down to the}} local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making of our marriage – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E
60|$|Gregory had, on {{his arrival}} with the brigade the day before, {{gone into the}} town; and engaged <b>a</b> small house, <b>in</b> its outskirts, as the abode of Fatma and her two attendants, {{purchased}} suitable provisions, and made what arrangements he could for her comfort. Late in the evening he had escorted her there, and left Zaki <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> outhouse attached <b>to</b> it, to secure them from all intrusion.|$|R

He read it with unchanging face, and placed it {{carefully}} in his breast coat-pocket.|$|R

500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You take it or leave it." [...] Higginbotham would later identify this encounter, and an incident where he was traveling with the Purdue debate team, but unable to stay in a hotel {{with the rest of the}} members, as the events that caused him to pursue a career in the law, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1999, Victoria Climbié (born 2 November 1991 in Abobo, Côte d'Ivoire, died 25 February 2000 at St. Mary's Hospital, London) and {{her great}} aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao arrived in London, sent {{by her parents}} for a chance of an education. A few months later, Kouao met Carl Manning on a bus which he was driving, and she and Victoria moved into his flat. It was here that she was abused, {{including}} being beaten with hammers, bike chains, and wires; being forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bin liner in the bath; and being tied up for periods of over 24 hours. In the period leading up to her death, the police, the social services of many local authorities, the NHS, the NSPCC, and local churches all had contact with her, and noted the signs of abuse. However, in what {{the judge in the}} trial following Victoria's death described as [...] "blinding incompetence", all failed to properly investigate the abuse and little action was taken. On 24 February 2000, Victoria was admitted into an accident-and-emergency department, semi-unconscious and suffering from hypothermia, multiple organ failure and malnutrition. She died the next day, aged eight. On 20 November 2000, her guardians, Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning, were charged with child cruelty and murder; on 12 January 2001, both were found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
500|$|From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{bin liner}} {{in the bathtub}} in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her {{frequent}} bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who {{were believed to be}} at serious risk. Laming said in his report, [...] "it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{advocate}} enhancing creativity {{by taking}} advantage of hypnagogia, the transition from wakefulness <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> using techniques such as lucid dreaming. One technique used by Salvador Dalí was to drift off <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind's subconscious imaginings. [...] Thomas Edison used the same technique, with ball bearings.|$|R

Weinstein went to cover other patients, and Stone went <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> on-call room <b>in</b> <b>an</b> adjacent building. Zion, however, did not improve, and continued to become more agitated. After being contacted by nurses by phone, Weinstein ordered medical restraints be placed on Zion. She also prescribed haloperidol by phone to control the agitation.|$|R

2500|$|Burrows entered {{late into}} the 2006 series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! on day seven. She was found hanging from a tight rope {{and had to be}} rescued as part of the trial by Matt Willis and Lauren Booth. On her first night she had <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hammock, and fell out of it. She took part in several [...] "Bushtrucker trials" [...] most notably one dubbed [...] "Skyscrape". Burrows and fellow {{contestant}} Myleene Klass were required to clamber onto a seesaw platform 200ft above the jungle floor and take turns to collect corresponding flags hanging off the edges of the platform. Each pair of flags, collected in numerical order, equalled a much needed meal for camp. She was the sixth celebrity to be evicted in a head-to-head with Dean Gaffney.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Schwarz {{was born}} Heinz Schwarz to Fritz (1897–1969) and Alma Schwarz (1901–1999) in Cologne, Germany. His family {{belonged to the}} Glockengasse Synagogue. He arrived in South Africa as a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1934 {{with his mother and}} younger brother Kurt. His father Fritz, a Social Democratic Party activist, left for South Africa the night the Nazis came to power. They boarded the SS Giulio Cesare in Genoa, Italy which took them to South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town they stayed in one room in a house in Kloof Street. Schwarz {{described}} how he was [...] "lucky" [...] as eventually he was able <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bathroom in a rusty bath. He spoke no Afrikaans or English at first and had strong memories of being taunted on the schoolyard for being different. Schwarz stated in an interview in 1991 that [...] "I know what the word discrimination means, not because I've read it in a book, but because I've been the subject of it. And I {{know what it means to}} be hungry." [...] The discrimination and financial difficulties of his family left a strong impression on Schwarz and helped shape his political philosophy with its emphasis on social justice and the rule of law.|$|E

I used <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner of the studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings I would come back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 25, 1848, Kane left Fort Edmonton, {{travelling}} {{with a large}} {{party of}} 23 boats and 130 people bound for York Factory, led by John Edward Harriott. [...] On June 1 they met with a large war party of some 1,500 warriors of Blackfoot and other tribes who were planning a raid against the Cree and Assiniboine. On that occasion Kane met the Blackfoot chief Big Snake (Omoxesisixany). The canoe brigade stayed as briefly as possible and then continued hastily down the river. On June 18 they arrived at Norway House, where Kane stayed for a month, waiting for {{the annual meeting of}} the chief factors of the Hudson's Bay Company and the arrival of the party with which he was bound to travel further. On July 24 he departed with the party of one Major McKenzie; they travelled along the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg to Fort Alexander. From there on Kane followed the same route he had taken two years earlier going west: by the Lake of the Woods, Fort Frances, and Rainy Lake, he travelled by canoe to Fort William and then along the northern shore of Lake Superior until he reached Sault Ste. Marie on October 1, 1848. From there he returned by steamboat to Toronto, where he landed on October 13. He noted in his book on this last leg of his journey: [...] "the greatest hardship that I had to endure [...] was the difficulty in trying <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> civilized bed".|$|E
