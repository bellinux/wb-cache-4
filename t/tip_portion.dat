40|$|The {{rotary blade}} {{consists}} of two portions which influence a tillage resistance, i. e, the straight portion and the bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion.</b> First, the total tillage torque curve induced in the standard blade {{was measured by the}} tillage tests. Secondly, a tillage torque curve induced in the straight portion was measured by the tillage test using the rotary blade, which was cut off the bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion.</b> Then, the tillage torque curve induced in the bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion</b> was calculated by subtracting the one induced in the straight portion from the standard one. The following results are obtained in this study. 1) The total tillage torque curve can be depicted approximately by a quadrilateral with a concavity, and the one in the straight portion by a triangle. 2) The average of the maximum total torque was 1. 8 times as large as one in the straight portion. The occurrence of the maximum torque in the standard blade and the straight portion appeared at 35 % and 24 % (average) of the total curve rising period, respectively. 3) The average of total torque in the deepest point of the concavity was 39 % of the maximum one, and it appeared at 63 % (average) of the period. 4) The average of the tillage energy per revolution was 23. 758 and 9. 166 kgf. m in the standard blade and in the straight portion, respectively. Then, the one in the bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion</b> was predicted to be 14. 592 kgf. m. Therefore, the tillage energy dissipated in the straight portion and in the bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion</b> were predicted to be 39 and 61 % (average), respectively, of the total tillage energy. 5) The area of tillage surface and the length of cutting arc were plotted with the rotation angle. Consequently, it appeared that the rotation angles of the standard blade which the area and the length became the maximum agreed well with that of bending <b>tip</b> <b>portion.</b> 6) This curve was slightly different from the experimental curve, however, we may predict approximately the curve of tillage resistance by this method. ロータリ耕うん刃を構成する直刃部と先端わん曲部の耕うん抵抗を求めるため, 耕うん回転角度ごとに各部から発生する耕うんトルク波形の大きさおよび形状を幾何学的に推定した. 全体刃と直刃部の耕うんトルクを測定し, その形状および大きさを検討した. 続いて, 1 回転あたりの全体刃と直刃部が占める耕うんエネルギから先端わん曲部に生ずる耕うんエネルギを計算し, 全体刃との比率を検討した. また, 耕うん抵抗の実測に用いた耕うん刃と同一な形状を有する模型を作成し, 模型刃による耕うん面積および切削弧の長さから耕うん波形の形状を検討した. その結果を要約すれば, 次のとおりである. ① 実測した全体刃の耕うんトルク波形は凹み点を有する四辺形, 直刃部の耕うんトルク波形は三角形で表わせる. ② 実測した最大耕うんトルクを比較すると, 全体刃は直刃部の約 1. 8 倍, 総回転角度に対する耕うんトルクの発生回転角度の比は全体刃で約 35 %, 直刃部で 24 %である. ③ 実測した全体刃の耕うんトルク波形の凹み点の大きさは最大耕うんトルクの約 39 %, 直刃部の最大耕うんトルクの約 70 %であり, その位置は全体刃の総回転角度の約 63 %である. また, この点を直刃部の波形と比較すると, 図 1 で仮定したように直刃部の耕うんトルク終了点の前方にある. ④ 実測した耕うん時の耕うん刃の 1 回転あたり耕うんエネルギの平均値は全体刃では, 23. 758 kgf・m, 直刃部では 9. 166 kgf・m となり, 全体刃は直刃部の約 2. 6 倍である. その結果, 先端わん曲部の占める耕うんエネルギは, 14. 592 kgf・mである. ⑤ 全体刃に対する先端わん曲部(弧ac) の耕うんエネルギの比率を実測値から求めると, 0. 614 となる. ⑥耕うん抵抗の大きさおよび形状を模型刃の耕うん面積および切削弧の長さから比較検討した結果, 全体刃と先端わん曲部の最大耕うん波形が出現する回転角度は良く一致した. また, 直刃部の耕うん波形は回転角度の変化とともに最大値まで直線的に増加し, その後は耕うん終了まで直線的に減少した. この耕うん波形と実測した耕うん抵抗波形の形状には異なる点も認められたが, 近似的に耕うん抵抗波形を予測できると思われる...|$|E

Para a germinação, quatro repetições de 50 sementes tratadas com Vitavax-Thiran foram semeadas em bandejas de plástico, contendo Sphagnum sp. como substrato e mantidas sob condições ambientais de laboratório. Detalhes da morfologia da semente foram documentados com o uso de microscopia eletrônica de varredura e esquematizados com auxílio de câmara clara, acoplada ao estereomicroscópio. Foram confeccionadas lâminas permanentes com cortes do embrião, para o estudo de sua anatomia. As dimensões médias das sementes foram: 10, 32 mm comprimento, 5, 21 mm largura e 3, 91 mm espessura. O peso de 1000 sementes foi de 151, 1 g e 1 kg continha 6600 unidades. O início da germinação variou entre 27 e 58 dias. As sementes são albuminosas, com endosperma duro e o embrião é pouco diferenciado, lateral e periférico. A germinação inicia-se pela abertura de um opérculo, através do qual é emitido o pecíolo cotiledonar com o eixo embrionário na extremidade. O pecíolo funciona, internamente, como um haustório, digerindo gradativamente o endosperma. Na sua parte posterior, desenvolve-se a plúmula, que emerge através de uma fenda. Nota-se o aparecimento de raízes secundárias na porção {{anterior}} da raiz primária. The {{objective of}} this study was to investigate the morphology, anatomy and germination behaviour of Phoenix roebelenii seeds. Biometric data were obtained by measuring 100 seeds extracted from recently harvested fruits and air-dried for one day. Four replications of 50 seeds each were previously treated with Vitavax-Thiran and then put to germinate in Sphagnum sp. in plastic trays at room temperature. Morphological details of the seeds were documented with the help of a scanning electronic microscope and then drawings were made with the help of a clear camera coupled to a stereomicroscope. Permanent lamina containing embryo sections were prepared to study its anatomy. The mean dimensions of the seeds were: length of 10. 32 mm, width of 5. 21 mm and thickness of 3. 91 mm. The weight of one thousand seeds was of 151. 1 g and the mean number of units. kg- 1 was 6, 600. Germination started between 27 and 58 days after sowing. The seeds are of the albuminous type, the endosperm is hard and the embryo (which is not clearly differentiated) occupies a lateral and peripheral position. During seed germination, seedling protrusion begins with the opening of an operculum, through which the cotyledon petiole is emitted with the embryonic axis at its <b>tip.</b> The <b>portion</b> of the cotyledon petiole that remains inside the seeds acts as a haustorium for the absorption of nutrients from the endosperm. The plumule emerges through a rift in the posterior part of the cotyledon. Secondary roots are observed to grow from the anterior part of the primary root...|$|R
