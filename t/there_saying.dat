25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the city, the Church of the Holy Sephulcre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered {{what to do with}} it. Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers however told him to let the Church remain <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> that Christian pilgrimages would continue anyway because of the sanctity of the place and also reminded him of the Caliph Umar who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin rejected the destruction of the church saying that he had no intention to discourage the Christian pilgrimages to the site and it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine later known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Jacobites were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit The Church of the Holy Sephulcre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E

500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing <b>there</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
500|$|Mimi bought {{volumes of}} short stories for Lennon, and her husband taught Lennon to read {{at the age of}} five by reading aloud the {{headlines}} of the Liverpool Echo. Every summer, from the age of nine until he was fifteen, she sent Lennon alone on a ten-hour bus journey to visit his Aunt Mater and cousin Stanley Parkes at their home near Loch Meadie in Durness, Scotland. Mimi also took her charge to a garden party in Calderstones Park every year, where a Salvation Army band played. She remembered Lennon pulling her by the hand to get <b>there,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Hurry up Mimi – we’re going to be late". Strawberry Field, in Beaconsfield Road, was the name of a Salvation Army house that Lennon would later immortalise in the Beatles' song, [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". She would later say: [...] "John loved his uncle George [...] I felt quite left out of that. They'd go off together, just leaving me a bar of chocolate and a note saying, 'Have a happy day'".|$|E
500|$|Although Giridhar did {{not have}} any formal {{schooling}} till the age of seventeen years, he had learned many literary works as a child by listening to them. His family wished him to become a Kathavachak (a Katha artist) but Giridhar wanted to pursue his studies. His father explored possibilities for his education in Varanasi and thought of sending him to a special school for blind students. Giridhar's mother refused to send him <b>there,</b> <b>saying</b> that blind children were not treated well at the school. On 7 July 1967 Giridhar joined the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College in the nearby Sujanganj village of Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Vyakarana (grammar), Hindi, English, Maths, History, and Geography. In his autobiography he recalls this day as the day when the [...] "Golden Journey" [...] of his life began. With an ability to memorise material by listening to it just once, Giridhar has not used Braille or other aids to study. In three months, he had memorised and mastered the entire Laghusiddhāntakaumudī of Varadaraja. He was top of his class for four years, and passed the Uttara Madhyama (higher secondary) examination in Sanskrit with first class and distinction.|$|E

500|$|Annemarie Roelofs {{recalled}} that {{critics of the}} Feminist Improvising Group were always either very positive, or very negative; {{there was never any}} middle-ground. Nicols and Roelofs said they received little support from male improvisers, who criticised their technical ability and referred to them as women, not musicians. FIG's message that [...] "anyone can do it" [...] antagonised many who value [...] "technical virtuosity" [...] and [...] "improvisational competence". Nicols said they also complained about FIG's [...] "irreverent approach to technique and tradition", while Smith suggested that they may have felt threatened by the [...] "spectacle of so many unsupervised and unpredictable women on the stage". Irène Schweizer {{recalled that}} FIG were invited to perform at the Total Music Meeting in Berlin in November 1979 because she had played at the festival before (in all-men groups). But after seeing FIG perform, the organiser asked Schweizer [...] "how come you brought such a group, they can't play, and they are not good enough." [...] Nicols said that avant-garde musician Alexander von Schlippenbach also complained about FIG being <b>there,</b> <b>saying</b> that [...] "we couldn't play our instruments" [...] and that he could have found [...] "loads of men that would have played a lot better".|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, then-Harvard {{assistant}} coach Bill Holden saw that Lin was [...] tall, which fit the physical attributes he was seeking, {{and he had}} a 4.2 grade point average in high school, which met Harvard's academic standards. But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting <b>there</b> <b>saying</b> all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. The kid was right across the street. [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem." [...] Kerry Keating, the UCLA assistant who offered Lin the opportunity to walk-on, said in hindsight that Lin would probably have ended up starting at point guard for UCLA.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him <b>there,</b> <b>saying</b> {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E
