60|$|I nodded, {{for it was}} one of the Latin tags <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> taught me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} have it otherwise--I would not for worlds <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> acted otherwise,' said Philip. 'You {{understand}} that, Laura.' ...|$|E
6000|$|This last {{question}} {{was put to}} my small cousin, who, in the horror of her belief <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> gone mad, had agitated the window-curtain and revealed herself! ...|$|E
6000|$|Suzette rose. [...] "Then {{some of the}} {{directors}} believe <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> been taking the money of the company, as the papers say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} more care of yourself," [...] she said gravely. [...] "I hope <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> {{expressed}} himself properly about the lecture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nurse, this is {{the gentleman}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> asked to stay with us. Mr. Heigham, let me {{introduce}} you to my old nurse Pigott." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should not}} even have known <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> taken a second wife but for some friend (or enemy)--I never {{discovered}} the person--who sent me a newspaper containing an announcement of the marriage.|$|E
60|$|I was converted. I had no doubts. It {{seemed at}} the moment <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> acted wisely in leaving his Iowa farm in order to claim his share of Uncle Sam's rapidly-lessening {{unclaimed}} land.|$|E
6000|$|O <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> ne'er on me smil'd; [...] O that {{my mother}} had ne'er to me sung! [...] O that my cradle had never been rock'd; [...] But that I had died when I was young! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how comes it <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> seen naught of {{what has}} been so plain to me--that M. de Mancini was ever at my sister's side?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Herr Zamenoy," [...] {{began the}} Jew, [...] "you are, I think, aware <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> {{purchased}} from your friend and brother-in-law, Josef Balatka, certain {{houses in the}} Kleinseite, in one of which the old man still lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But then,' {{said the}} girl, 'what {{did you mean}} by saying <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> done you a great service. You are deceiving me. I have said too much. This is base!' Miss Markham rose, her eyes and cheeks burning.|$|R
6000|$|Later.--The {{letter was}} to express an earnest hope <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> set out. My poor mother is sinking, they fear. What {{will become of}} Caroline? O, how I wish I could see mother; why could not both have gone? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{accustomed}} to dissemble my beliefs," [...] said Austen, gravely. [...] "The fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> faith enough in me to count with certainty on my refusal {{to go before the}} convention enabled him to win the nomination for the candidate of your railroads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{than three}} years ago. At her death, I was {{fortunate}} enough to obtain an appointment similar to <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had,</b> {{and at the same time}} a commission in the Egyptian service; and have been fortunate in being, two or three times, mentioned in despatches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Methinks <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> need of me!' said Theseus to himself. Then {{he wrapped}} up the sword and shoon in the linen and the cloth of wool, and walked {{home in the}} early morning to the palace of Pittheus.|$|R
6000|$|... “No, I do {{not forget}} Louisa,” said Elizabeth, again {{compressing}} her beautiful lips. “You know, Effingham, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> told you <b>that</b> I ruled him, and that I should rule you. I am now about to exert my power.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be easy to prevent it, Maud. I should have come boldly into the valley, but for this {{accidental}} meeting with you, trusting <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> no one about him so base as to betray his son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, she {{has been}} already very uneasy at not hearing for so long from her father and brothers, Peters; and that and the fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> spoken openly against the Spanish {{authorities}} set her upon the track, and enabled her to put the questions straightforwardly to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> {{heard some}} rumors {{to the effect}} that the bank was not in a good state, and having no belief {{whatever}} in them, he bought the shares, thinking that his doing so would have a good effect upon its credit, in which as a sort of county institution, he felt an interest." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had evidently}} heard the few words {{exchanged}} between {{his friend and}} myself. It seemed odd that he should take any interest in a place belonging {{to people who were}} strangers to him. However, his question was easily answered. I had only to inform him <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> sold the house when he left England.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> {{done all}} these things, {{and if they}} are in this place I would go there also, for I am minded to be with <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> at the last. Yet I think that I should find a way to escape if ever I came there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With little, I fear," [...] {{answered}} the charming girl, in a low, melancholy tone. [...] "At least, I know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> been disappointed. Sus listens to him attentively, but he manifests no feeling beyond {{respect for the}} speaker. Attempts {{have been made to}} induce him to enter the church before, but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I always herald {{my arrival}} {{in a country}} house by a little present of tea,' said Dick. 'The fact is it's the only good tea in the world. I sent <b>my</b> <b>father</b> to China for seven years to find it, and I'm sure you will agree <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> not lived an ill-spent life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> {{more to do}} {{with this}} matter of {{imperial}} right than the Grecian girl whom it pleased him to marry for her fair face," [...] answered Constantine insolently, adding: [...] "Learn your station, mother. Learn that you are but the lamp which once held the holy oil, and that lamps can be shattered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I gave up {{dealing in}} reddle last Christmas," [...] said Venn. [...] "It was a {{profitable}} trade, and I found that {{by that time}} I had made {{enough to take the}} dairy of fifty cows <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> in his lifetime. I always thought of getting to that place again if I changed at all, and now I am there." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus it chanced {{that when}} he had sailed from Yarmouth a year and six months, there came {{a letter from the}} abbot of the monastery in Seville to his brother, the prior of St. Mary's at Bungay, saying <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> fled from the monastery, leaving no trace of where he had gone. My {{grandfather}} was grieved at this tidings, but said little about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! What do I {{want with}} a wife? Do {{you mean to}} say <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> told you <b>that</b> he intends to clog his legacy with the burden of a wife? I would not accept it with such a burden,--unless I could choose the wife myself. To tell the truth, there is a girl--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} I owe you my life," [...] replied {{the girl in}} a quiet voice, [...] "and while I am now {{positive}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> entirely regained his sanity, and looks with as great abhorrence upon the terrible fate he planned for me as I myself, I cannot forget the debt of gratitude which belongs to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "John Carter," [...] she cried, [...] "for {{the last}} time I offer you the love of Phaidor, {{daughter}} of the Holy Hekkador. Accept and your princess shall {{be returned to the}} court of her grandfather, and you shall live in peace and happiness. Refuse and the fate <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> threatened shall fall upon Dejah Thoris.|$|R
6000|$|There {{came to me}} on {{the instant}} a wild song <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> taught me when the liquor held him in dominance. Exhilarated, I sprang from Terence's arms to the sodden, bared space, and methinks I yet hear my shrill, piping note, and see my legs kicking in the fling of it. There was an uproar, a deeper voice chimed in, and here was McAndrew flinging his legs with mine:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He was too distressed to say much. He fervently {{pressed my}} hand; he fervently thanked God <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> not lived {{to hear what}} he had heard. Then, after a pause, he {{repeated}} my mother-in-law's name to himself in a doubting, questioning tone. [...] "Macallan?" [...] he said. [...] "Macallan? Where have I heard that name? Why does it sound as if it wasn't strange to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Banker {{was not on}} {{good terms}} with my uncle, so the latter knew that if the former became my {{guardian}} the loan <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> consented to make would most likely never be carried out. In this predicament my uncle had taken his first wrong step. He had hidden my father's will and brought forth an old {{one in which he}} himself was named as guardian.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't," [...] exclaimed Godfrey {{in a kind}} of wail. [...] "I am to {{be taken}} off to a school in some town or other, I forget which, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> been examining. I suppose it is the speech day, and he proposes to {{introduce}} me as a kind of object lesson because I have passed first in an examination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means," [...] she said, as coldly as ever, [...] "that I {{have lost}} my self-respect; it means <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> renounced me, {{and that you}} will do well to follow his example. Have I not led {{you to believe that}} I could never be the wife of Lord Harry? Well, I have deceived you---I am going to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Sdeath, mother, {{why must}} you harp on that? I a'n't the fool you think me," [...] he cried. [...] "I shall {{make it a}} further {{condition}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> immunity. There will be no lack of victims once the plot is disclosed; and they may begin upon that coxcomb Caryll--the damned meddler {{who is at the}} bottom of all this garboil." ...|$|R
