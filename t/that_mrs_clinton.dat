The writer noticed that in term of tight competition in global era, schools in Indonesia either state or private owned had made some efforts to develop themselves as global schools. In this case {{it is necessary to}} analyze whether a school that claimed itself 'global' has met the global school indicators such as its curriculum, culture, facilities, teachers' perception and competence as well as development strategies. This global school development phenomenon is one of the reason for the writer to study on two schools, MRS and DCS. Those two schools are both located in Semarang and developed rapidly as schools with the mission to conduct international and global standard schools. The focus {{of this study is to}} analyze the global school indicators applied in MRS and DCS, including teachers’ perception on global education system, teachers’ global competence and also the school’s strategy on teachers’ global competence development. The data were collected through surveys, observation and in-depth interview which then analyzed using descriptive-qualitative method.

40|$|Providing {{people with}} fresh water {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges of the century. Since most of the world's liquid fresh water is groundwater, the knowledge of aquifer storage properties is essential. Moreover, there is a need to focus research on poor aquifers (i. e. capable of providing about 100 m(3) /day) which will play an increasing role for supplying many human communities. This paper concerns a study carried out in a clayey sandstones aquifer in Northern Cambodia. Conventional hydraulic methods used to characterize aquifers are costly, time-consuming and thus they are usually not used in most of the water projects in developing countries. Therefore, geophysical methods can be useful if they improve aquifer characterization. As compared to other non-invasive geophysical methods, magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is selective to groundwater. MRS results are the distribution of both water content and pore-size related-parameters as a function of depth. However, relationships between the field scale MRS results and hydrogeological storage-related properties have not been well established yet. We present in this paper a comparison of MRS results with both specific yield calculated from pumping tests and effective porosity calculated from tracer tests. We found <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> water content is equal or higher than the specific yield and the effective porosity, thus indicating <b>that</b> <b>MRS</b> also measures capillary water in unsaturated zone and part of the bound groundwater attached to the aquifer solid matrix. We also found <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> pore-size parameter is linearly correlated with both the effective porosity and the specific yield, thus suggesting that the hydrogeological storage properties are mainly controlled by the size of the pores of the aquifer. Consequently, we adapted an approach used in the oil industry for differencing gravitational water from capillary water and from bound water, based on the MRS pore-size parameter. In the clayey sandstones of Cambodia, our approach named MRS apparent cutoff time approach, allowed calculating specific yield with an average error of 23 % (which is far less than the previous published results), and for the first time it allowed calculating effective porosity (with an average error of 11 %). We conclude <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> apparent cutoff time approach is useful for estimating aquifer storage properties down to 50 - 80 m deep, in a single day and at an affordable cost...|$|R

40|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of boreholes have been drilled in hard rocks of Africa and Asia for supplying human communities with drinking water. Despite the common use of geophysics for improving the siting of boreholes, {{a significant number of}} drilled holes does not deliver enough water to be equipped (e. g. 40 % on average in Benin). As compared to other non-invasive geophysical methods, magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is selective to groundwater. However, this distinctive feature has not been fully used in previous published studies for quantifying the drainable groundwater in hard rocks (i. e. the specific yield) and the short-term productivity of aquifer (i. e. the transmissivity). We present in this paper a comparison of MRS results (i. e. the water content and pore-size parameter) with both specific yield and transmissivity calculated from long duration pumping tests. We conducted our experiments in six sites located in different hard rock groups in Benin, thus providing a unique data set to assess the usefulness of MRS in hard rock aquifers. We found <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> water content is about twice the specific yield. We also found <b>that</b> the <b>MRS</b> pore-size parameter is well correlated with the specific yield. Thus we proposed two linear equations for calculating the specific yield from the MRS water content (with an uncertainty of about 10 %) and from the pore-size parameter (with an uncertainty of about 20 %). The later has the advantage of defining a so-named MRS cutoff time value for indentifying non-drainable MRS water content and thus low groundwater reserve. We eventually propose a nonlinear equation for calculating the specific yield using jointly the MRS water content and the pore-size parameters, but this approach has to be confirmed with further investigations. This study also confirmed that aquifer transmissivity can be estimated from MRS results with an uncertainty of about 70 %. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>MRS</b> can be usefully applied for estimating aquifer specific yield and transmissivity in weathered hard rock aquifers. Our result will contribute to the improvement of well siting and groundwater management in hard rocks...|$|R

Specifically, I examined the convergence of indices of the same response bias for a given instrument; the stability of response bias indexes across instruments in the same data set; cross-cultural differences in acquiescence response style (ARS) in relation to individualism and collectivism; differences in extreme response style (ERS) {{based on the number}} of rating scale response points; cross-cultural differences in ERS; cross-cultural differences in midpoint responding (MRS); and the effects of controlling for response biases. I examined several data sets that included a variety of instruments with a variety of constructs measured, response anchors, and numbers of rating points. I found at least moderate convergence of indices of the same response bias for a given instrument. Individual differences in acquiescence and ERS response biases were found to have some stability, but primarily across instruments with similar rating scales and constructs. I found mixed support for the hypothesis that ARS would be higher in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures but ARS tended to be higher in Mexico than in the other cultures. ERS was found to be higher on scales with fewer response points compared to scales with higher numbers of response points. Hofstede's Power Distance dimension did not account for cross-cultural differences in ERS. There was some support for the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>MRS</b> would be higher in the East Asian country of Japan but results were not statistically significant. There was not definitive support for the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>MRS</b> would be higher in low power distance cultures than in high power distance cultures.

40|$|Abstract Clinical {{trials are}} at the centre of {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} stroke and its optimal treatment. In this thesis the uses and properties of outcome assessment scales for stroke trials are described, with particular attention given to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Through comprehensive literature review I will show <b>that</b> <b>mRS</b> is the most frequently used functional outcome scale in clinical trials but efficacy of the scale is potentially limited by inter-observer variability. Using a “mock” clinical trial design I demonstrate <b>that</b> inter-observer <b>mRS</b> variability in contemporary practice is moderate (k= 0. 57). Adding these data to systematic review of published data, confirms an overall moderate inter-observer variability across ten trials (k= 0. 46). Differing strategies to improve mRS reliability will then be described. I will outline development of a bespoke training package, international training scores across 2942 raters again confirms suboptimal reliability (k= 0. 67). A pilot trial using endpoint committee review of video recorded interviews demonstrates feasibility of this approach. Attempts to improve reliability by deriving mRS from data recorded in patients’ hospital records are not successful (k= 0. 34). In the final chapters I present a novel methodology for describing stroke outcomes – “home-time”. This measure shows good agreement with mRS, except at extremes of disability. Finally to put mRS in a historical context, the career of John Rankin and the development of his eponymous scale is recounted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Modified Rankin score (mRS) is {{traditionally}} graded using a face-to-face or telephone interview. Certain stroke assessment scales {{can be derived}} from a review of a patient’s case-record alone. We hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>mRS</b> could be successfully derived from the narrative within patient case-records. Methods: Sequential patients attending our cerebrovascular outpatient clinic were included. Two independent, blinded clinicians, trained in mRS, assessed case-records to derive mRS. They scored “certainty” of their grading on a 5 -point Likert scale. Agreement between derived and traditional face-to-face mRS was calculated using attribute agreement analysis. Results: Fifty patients with a range of disabilities were included. Case-record appraisers were poor at deriving mRS (k= 0. 34 against standard). Derived mRS grades showed poor agreement between observers (k= 0. 33). There was no relationship between certainty of derived mRS and proportion of correct grades (P= 0. 727). Conclusion: Accurate mRS cannot be derived from standard hospital records. Direct mRS interview is still required for clinical trials. </p...|$|R
