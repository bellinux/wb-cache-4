2500|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has a broad {{geographical}} distribution. It {{has been}} isolated from many areas {{across the world}} including Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Antarctica where it is known from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. It is principally characterized as a phyllosphere fungus and is commonly found in areas of decaying organic material such as leaves and grains as well as ripening grapes. Isolates of this species however have been recovered from freshwater, marine water and clinical specimens. [...] It has also been isolated from agricultural areas and indoor built environments. In agricultural environments, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor can pose a respiratory hazard for agricultural workers. Agricultural workers are subject to increased exposure when they partake in activities involving the handling of grains. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has additionally been isolated from straw in hay barns or hay lofts. Workers in these settings should consider the proper use of masks to avoid infection. If individuals show atopic symptoms, a change in occupation might be considered. In indoor environments, S.salmonicolor has been associated with severe water and mould damage. Flooded basements and utility rooms are places where S.salmonicolor may be recovered. This fungus will also commonly associate with standing water films, although not very much has been documented on this. It can form a pink water film around stagnant <b>toilet</b> <b>water.</b> The most efficient way to avoid exposure in the home is to eliminate moisture sources and keep bathrooms clean, dry and ventilated.|$|E
