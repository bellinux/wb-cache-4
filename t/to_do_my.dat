500|$|In 1994, Jean and Reiss {{signed a}} three-year deal with The Walt Disney Company to produce other {{television}} shows for ABC. The duo created and executive produced Teen Angel, which was canceled {{in its first}} season. Reiss said [...] "It was so compromised and overworked. I had 11 executives full-time telling me how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> job." [...] The pair periodically returned to work on The Simpsons— for example, while under contract at Disney {{they were allowed to}} write and produce four episodes of the show, including season eight's [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" [...] (1997).|$|E

[...] During his service, Tatsuguchi kept a diary, recording his first-hand observations of military service {{as well as his}} thoughts and feelings about the events in which he was involved. In September 1942, after learning that he would be reassigned to a combat area in Rabaul, New Britain, he noted in his diary, [...] "I feel very happy and I am determined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best", adding that he was [...] "determined to destroy the enemy force to the very last soldier".|$|E

[...] They became friends, and Frise began providing colour illustrations to Clark's tales in the Star of the pair's misadventures in Toronto—Frise tall and gangly, and Clark short and stout. [...] A selection appeared in a volume titled Which We Did in 1936. [...] Frise talked of their blunderings to the Star: [...] "We've fried eggs on the city hall steps. We caulked my house and flooded the parlor with cement. I once let Greg persuade {{me to get a}} steam shovel <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> spring digging and ruined my garden. Perhaps this book is our most foolish adventure." ...|$|E

In preparation for the role, Armand watched Marvel's The Avengers, and took gym classes. About working on the show, Armand said [...] "The pressure is always on for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best work, no matter what I do. That’s just who I am. It started to seep in just how big this show was while I {{was working on the}} set, when I went to Stockholm, Sweden and coming back home to [...] [...] was talking about the show and there were posters everywhere advertising it ...

500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, I had done what I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> <b>My</b> love for the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E
500|$|Sanford {{announced}} in late December 1997 {{that he had}} been diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do my best <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E

500|$|The {{music for}} the film was {{composed}} by A. R. Rahman, who teamed up with Yash Chopra for the first time. He signed to compose the soundtrack in May 2011. The first song of the soundtrack was completed in December 2011. By February 2012, Rahman {{said in an interview}} with The Times of India that he had completed three songs for the film. He summarized the soundtrack album: [...] "It's a combination. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> kind of songs at the same time they wanted the old charm and soul of music that Indian audience would love and which I wanted to do for a long time." [...] The soundtrack features nine songs, with eight lyrics by Gulzar and the title track written by Aditya Chopra. It was released by YRF Music on 9 October 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
500|$|Stewart {{approached}} the project with gusto, remarking that he [...] "wrote an adaptation from {{a novel that}} tells about the fascist mice who are nibbling away at our country while we're busy fighting a good war". Stewart believed Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views, and felt vindicated by the assignment, declaring that [...] "here was my compensation for the sabotage of my radical attempt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> bit...". The script was the proudest moment of his entire career. Stewart, however, had extensive problems adapting the novel for the screen, and filming—originally due to begin in June 1942—was delayed for several months while {{he worked on the}} screenplay. He consulted with the Bureau of Motion Pictures in the U.S. Office of War Information, an agency of the federal government created in June 1942 to promote patriotism and warn the public about domestic spying.|$|E

500|$|Before {{starting}} filming {{or making}} an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: [...] "my own technique {{to get myself}} going was... to jump {{in the air and}} execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character [...] "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he [...] "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said [...] "I like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> own stunts", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, 2009, Beyoncé had a revue titled I Am... Yours at the Encore Theater, in Wynn Las Vegas {{during a}} stint on her {{worldwide}} I Am... Tour (2009–2010). Her performance {{was backed by}} her all-female band, Suga Mama, and an orchestra. The show was choreographed by Beyoncé and Frank Gatson Jr. Regarding her I Am... Yours revue, Beyoncé said, [...] "I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> own show there, {{because a lot of}} the icons that I look up to had amazing shows in Las Vegas.

500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E
