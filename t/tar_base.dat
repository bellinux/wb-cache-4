The increasing scarcity of good road construction materials, combined with long haulage distances have necessitated the use of methods to improve substandard or existing materials through recycling. Although in-situ recycling has grown in prominence as a road construction alternative it necessitates the need for expensive equipment and expertise. Foamed tar provides a viable construction method for low volume roads {{through the application of}} labour intensive construction principles. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the constructability of low-volume roads using foamed tar stabilisation with the assistance of the local community in infrastructure development. The paper will firstly introduce the subject of foamed tar stabilisation and address the perceived health aspects associate with this product. The construction of the foamed <b>tar</b> <b>base</b> course will be discussed extensively, with particular reference being placed on the construction process, and associated limitations, and the transportation, placement and compaction of the foamed tar stabilised material. The stockpiling ability of foamed tar and the structural capacity of the constructed test section will be evaluated. Finally conclusions will be drawn concerning the application of this technology and its success in providing an economically viable alternative for the construction of low volume roads through community involvement.

TAR emerged as an interim solution to speed up DNSSEC deployment but is currently considered as a technology that can solve known issues with interdomain trust management in an open Internet environment.

Results with additional reporters suggest that extending the RNA helix in the dimeric arrangements inhibits peptide binding by decreasing major groove accessibility. In contrast, a dimeric peptide efficiently bound an optimally arranged dimeric TAR in vivo, and bound with an affinity at least 10 -fold higher than the monomeric peptide in vitro.

50|$|Initially, Tarkovsky had {{no clear}} {{understanding}} of the musical atmosphere of the final film and only an approximate idea where in the film the music was to be. Even after he had shot all the material he continued his search for the ideal film score, wanting a combination of Oriental and Western music. In a conversation with Artemyev he explained that he needed music that reflects the idea that although the East and the West can coexist, they are not able to understand each other. One of Tarkovsky's ideas was to perform Western music on Oriental instruments, or vice versa, performing Oriental music on European instruments. Artemyev proposed to try this idea with the motet Pulcherrima Rosa by an anonymous 14th century Italian composer dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In its original form Tarkovsky did not perceive the motet as suitable for the film and asked Artemyev to give it an Oriental sound. Later, Tarkovsky proposed to invite musicians from Armenia and Azerbaijan and to let them improvise on the melody of the motet. A musician was invited from Azerbaijan who played the main melody on a <b>tar</b> <b>based</b> on mugham, accompanied by orchestral background music written by Artemyev.

The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the tar acids won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%. The hydrocarbons are mainly aromatic; derivatives of benzene and related cyclic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, acenapthene, and fluorene. Creosotes from vertical-retort and low temperature tars contain, in addition, some paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. The tar-acid content also depends on the source of the tar—it may be less than 3% in creosote from coke-oven tar and as high as 32% in creosote from vertical retort tar. All of these have antiseptic properties. The tar acids are the strongest antiseptics but have the highest degree of solubility in water and are the most volatile; so, like with wood-tar creosote, phenols are not the most valued component, as by themselves they would lend to being poor preservatives. In addition, creosote will contain several products naturally occurring in coal—nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as acridines, carbazoles, and quinolines, referred to as the [...] "tar bases" [...] and generally make up about 3% of the creosote—sulfur-containing heterocycles, generally benzothiophenes—and oxygen-containing heterocycles, dibenzofurans.

Total cotinine is a biomarker of nicotine uptake. There were no statistically significant differences in urinary levels of 1 -HOP, total NNAL, and total cotinine in smokers of regular, light, and ultralight cigarettes, whether the results were expressed per mg urinary creatinine, per mL of urine, or per mg creatinine divided by cigarettes per day.

40|$|Since the 1960 s {{hydrocarbons}} like {{crude oil}} and natural gas have been the most important energy source to fuel the world economy. Despite high recent growth rates for renewable energies, hydro- carbons are expected to be a dominant source of energy for several decades to come. In the last 20 years not only fundamental trends, but also singular events such as the financial crisis have shaped the development of crude {{oil and natural}} gas markets as well as the corresponding academic debate. On a historic scale these last two decades have seen changes in oil and gas markets that - in terms of price and regional production changes - are only matched by the turmoils of the oil crisis of the 1970 s. Hence, the objective of this thesis is to improve the understanding of some of the dynamics and trends underlying these developments. Around the turn of the millenium the growth of wealth and resource consumption in emerging economies and the fear of shrinking oil and gas production in industrialized countries refueled the time-honored debate about the point of time when the supply of fossil energy resources will reach its historic all time high. Labeled as the “peak oil hypothesis” the discussion gained most momentum for the case of crude oil, but similar worries were also expressed for natural gas. These solicitudes were also reflected and amplified by prolonged and steep increases in global oil and gas prices which in turn raises the question of how strong hydrocarbon supply will react to these price shocks. Accordingly, Chapter 2 of this thesis addresses oil and gas supply response to oil and gas price changes in the US. More specifically, because oil and gas supply can only be kept constant or increased by drilling additional wells, the essay focuses on the response of oil and gas drilling activity to changes in oil and gas prices as well as drilling costs. In the late year 2008 the oil and gas price boom came to a sudden end in a stark collapse during the turbulences of the financial crisis and its macroeconomic aftermath. Both oil and gas prices stopped plummeting only in spring 2009. Whereas global oil prices quickly recovered to pre-crisis levels, the US price of natural gas stayed at low levels and even started to trend slightly downward. Given the growing gas prices in Europe this led several market stakeholders to announce a disintegration of the Atlantic gas market into an US market and an European market. However, given quickly expanding transport capacities and trade volumes for liquified natural gas (LNG) other industry participants hesitate to consent with the market decoupling hypothesis. Accordingly, Chapter 3 empirically investigates the integration of Atlantic gas markets before and after the financial crisis. Price spikes are a frequent phenomenon in natural gas and other commodity markets. This can result in a low power of empirical market integration tests that are based on threshold autoregressive models. Similarly, threshold autoregressive (<b>TAR)</b> model <b>based</b> estimates of the transaction costs of arbitrage can be subject to large small sample biases when extreme price movements are present. To address this Chapter 4 investigates the small sample properties of TAR estimators and <b>TAR</b> <b>based</b> market (co-) integration tests. To remedy the poor small sample properties of the usual OLS <b>based</b> <b>TAR</b> estimation we propose two robust estimators. Accordingly, Chapter 4 methodologically advances the econometric approaches used in Chapter 3. In North America, the major driver underlying this putative gas market decoupling was the so called shale revolution - a term that describes a steep and unforeseen increase in hydrocarbon supply from unconventional shale formations in the US. The shale revolution started off in gas markets where the novel combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in formerly unfamiliar shale geology enabled sweeping production gains. However, oil drilling also quickly adopted the new approach. By tapping shale oil resources with cost-efficient technologies and pulled by high oil prices US crude oil production is now close to surpassing its historic all time high of November 1970. Hence, for the moment the advent of the US shale revolution has refuted most arguments for an impending now and forever peak in US oil or gas production. As shale resources are available in many countries around the globe, the success of the US shale revolution stimulates the desire to replicate the shale revolution in other countries. A large part of the technical side of the replication debate is about updating the technology of rig fleets such that they are capable of performing hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. However, in the US industry participants also highlight the importance of accumulated experience in using these technologies in a given region. Against this background, Chapter 5 investigates the role of drilling technology and local drilling experience as drivers of the oil and gas production growth during the US shale revolution. When the accumulation of local experience plays a crucial role for shale oil and gas production, it might be difficult to replicate the shale revolution in other countries by merely updating the technology level of the old rig fleet...|$|R
40|$|Steam can {{be fully}} or {{partially}} substituted by CO 2 as a gasification agent. This substitution affects producer gas composition, char conversion and in-situ tar reforming. Here, wood chips were gasified in a spouting fluidised bed using silica sand and catalytic dolomitic lime as the bed material at 850 °C. The {{use of a}} gasifying agent composed of CO 2 and H 2 O was {{compared to the use}} of CO 2 or H 2 O alone. It was found that mixtures of CO 2 and H 2 O as the gasifying agent improve char conversion, and that the combined gasification agents are very effective in ensuring the decomposition/destruction of <b>tars</b> when lime <b>based</b> materials are used in the fluidised bed...|$|R
40|$|A calf tissue cage {{model was}} used to study the {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of oxytetracycline in serum, inflamed (exudate) and noninflamed (transudate) tissue cage fluids. After intramuscular administration, the PK was characterized by a long mean residence time of 28. 3 hr. Based on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for six isolates each of Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, measured in serum, integration of in vivo PK and in vitro PD data established area under serum concentration–time curve (AUC 0 –∞) /MIC ratios of 30. 0 and 24. 3 hr for M. haemolytica and P. multocida, respectively. Corresponding AUC 0 –∞/MIC ratios based on MICs in broth were 656 and 745 hr, respectively. PK-PD modelling of in vitro bacterial time–kill curves for oxytetracycline in serum established mean AUC 0 – 24 hr/MIC ratios for 3 log 10 decrease in bacterial count of 27. 5 hr (M. haemolytica) and 60. 9 hr (P. multocida). Monte Carlo simulations predicted target attainment rate (<b>TAR)</b> dosages. <b>Based</b> on the potency of oxytetracycline in serum, the predicted 50 % TAR single doses required to achieve a bacteriostatic action covering 48 -hr periods were 197 mg/kg (M. haemolytica) and 314 mg/kg (P. multocida), respectively, against susceptible populations. Dosages based on the potency of oxytetracycline in broth were 25 -and 27 -fold lower (7. 8 and 11. 5 mg/kg) for M. haemolytica and P. multocida, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{transcription}} {{from the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter depends on binding of the viral regulatory protein Tat to a cis-acting RNA regulatory element, TAR. Tat binds at a trinucleotide bulge located near {{the apex of the}} TAR stem-loop structure. An essential feature of Tat-TAR interaction is that the protein induces a conformational change in TAR that repositions the functional groups on the bases and the phosphate backbone that are critical for specific intermolecular recognition of TAR RNA. We have previously determined a high resolution structure for the bound form of TAR RNA using heteronuclear NMR. Here, we describe a high resolution structure of the free <b>TAR</b> RNA <b>based</b> on 871 experimentally determined restraints. In the free TAR RNA, bulged residues U 23 and C 24 are stacked within the helix, while U 25 is looped out. This creates a major distortion of the phosphate backbone between C 24 and G 26. In contrast, in the bound TAR RNA, each of the three residues from the bulge are looped out of the helix and U 23 is drawn into proximity with G 26 through contacts with an arginine residue that is inserted between the two <b>bases.</b> Thus, <b>TAR</b> RNA undergoes a transition from a structure with an open and accessible major groove to a much more tightly packed structure that is folded around basic side chains emanating from the Tat protein...|$|R
