The advan cement of the tenets of queer theory is outlined chronologically, to display {{the evolution of the}} theory through intradisciplinary applications. The body of qualitative works utilizing queer theory is categorized (language, literature, and arts; history; life histories/life stories; and queer theory as praxis) and juxtaposed. In addition, efforts to define and enact a " queer pedagogy " are analyzed. Suggestions for further application of queer theory in education, ethnography, and qualitative studies conclude the article. I anticipate that out of the many questions a reader of this issue might have, the three most common are: What is queer theory? For that matter, what's queer?

40|$|Abstract: I aim to {{show that}} (i) there are good ways to argue about what has {{intrinsic}} value; and (ii) good ethical arguments needn’t make ethical assumptions. I support (i) and (ii) by rebutting direct attacks, by discussing nine plausible ways to argue about intrinsic value, and by arguing for pain’s intrinsic badness without making ethical assumptions. If (i) and (ii) are correct, then ethical theory has more resources than many philosophers have thought: empirical evidence, and evidence bearing on intrinsic value. With more resources, we can hope to base all of our moral beliefs on evidence rather than on, say, emotion or mere intuition. Philosophical disputes often endure despite centuries of debate. For this reason, some worry that our debates are ill-conceived. I want to address a less commonly expressed, but perhaps better-founded, worry: that our arguments must underdetermine how we solve the great philosophical problems, {{and so many of}} our cherished beliefs must arise from emotion and temperament, not from the rational assessment of evidence. In this essay I want to chip away at this concern, as it applies to ethical theory. Let’s define two extreme views. Pure optimists believe <b>that</b> the evidence <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|R

40|$|In many {{democratic}} countries, {{the timing}} of elections is flexible. We explore this potentially valuable option using insights from option pricing in finance. The paper offers three main contributions on this problem. First, we derive a rationally-based mean-reverting political support process for the parties, assuming that politically heterogeneous voters continuously learn over time about evolving party fortunes. We solve for the long-run density for this process and derive the polling process from it by adding polling noise. Second, we explore optimal timing using the political support process. The incumbent sees its poll support, and must call an election within five years of the last election to maximize its expected total time in office. This resembles the optimal exercise rule for an American financial option. This option is recursive, and the waiting and stopping values subtly interact. We prove {{the existence of the}} optimal exercise rule in this setting, and show that the expected longevity is a convex-thenconcave function of the political support.

40|$|Multifunctional Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) play pivotal {{roles in}} {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + signaling pathways. There is growing evidence that CaMKs {{are involved in}} the pathogenic mechanisms underlying various human diseases. In this review, we begin by briefly summarizing our knowledge of the involvement of CaMKs in the pathogenesis of various diseases suggested to be caused by the dysfunction/dysregulation or aberrant expression of CaMKs. It is widely known that the activities of CaMKs are strictly regulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of specific phosphorylation sites. Since phosphorylation status is balanced by protein kinases and protein phosphatases, the mechanism of dephosphorylation/deactivation of CaMKs, corresponding to their ‘switching off', is extremely important, as is the mechanism of phosphorylation/activation corresponding to their ‘switching on'. Therefore, we focus on the regulation of multifunctional CaMKs by protein phosphatases. We summarize the current understanding of negative regulation of CaMKs by protein phosphatases. We also discuss the biochemical properties and physiological significance of a protein phosphatase <b>that</b> <b>we</b> designated as <b>Ca</b> 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (CaMKP), and those of its homologue CaMKP-N.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{characteristics}} of well-being behavior of women living in Daegu and analyze their well-being levels according to their socio-demographic variables, thereby determining the effects of each variable on well-being behavior. A survey of 320 women was conducted and T-test, ANOVA was conducted for the well-being levels and well-being behavior based on socio-demographic variables. Multiple regression analysis was analyze the factors affecting well-being behavior. The major findings of this study were as follows. A higher level of education led to a higher level of well-being. Moreover, educational or counseling workers, those with higher monthly incomes, those with higher expenses spent on self-management, those who considered their physical condition good, and those who drank once or twice a week showed higher levels of well-being. According to the analysis of the variables influencing well-being behavior, those with an older age, a higher level of education, and higher expenses for self-management and non-smokers revealed higher degrees of involvement in well-being behavior.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in The Astrophysical Journal We present results from a detailed spectrophotometric analysis of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Mrk 35 (Haro 3), based on deep optical (BVRI) and near-IR (JHK) imaging, Hα narrow-band observations and long-slit spectroscopy. The optical emission of the galaxy is dominated by a central young starburst, with a bar-like shape, while an underlying component of stars, with elliptical isophotes and red colors, extends more than 4 kpc from the galaxy center. High resolution Hα and color maps allow us to identify the star-forming regions, to spatially discriminate them from the older stars, and to recognize several dust patches. We derive colors and Hα parameters for all the identified star-forming knots. Observables derived for each knot are corrected for {{the contribution of the}} underlying older stellar population, the contribution by emission lines, and from interstellar extinction, and compared with evolutionary synthesis models. We find that the contributions of these three factors are by no means negligible and that they significantly vary across the galaxy. Therefore, careful quantification and subtraction of emission lines, galaxy host contribution, and interstellar reddening at every galaxy position, are essential to derive the properties of the young stars in BCDs.

Unlike classic SOCE, ECCE {{does not depend on}} sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release. Indeed, ECCE produces a large Ca 2 + entry {{in response to}} physiological stimuli that do not produce substantial store depletion and depends on interactions among three different Ca 2 + channels: the DHPR, ryanodine receptor 1, and a Ca 2 + entry channel with properties corresponding to those of store-operated Ca 2 + channels.

40|$|Abstract: Massively multi-player games hold a huge {{market in}} the digital {{entertainment}} industry. Companies invest heavily in game developments since a successful online game can attract million of users, and this translates to a huge investment payoff. However, multi-player online games are also subjected to various forms of ``hacks' ' and ``cheats''. Hackers can alter the graphic rendering to reveal information otherwise be hidden in a normal game, or cheaters can use software robots {{to play the game}} automatically and thus gain an unfair advantage. To overcome these problems, some popular online games release software patches constantly to block ``known' ' hacks or incorporate anti-cheating software to detect ``known' ' cheats. This not only creates deployment difficulty but new cheats will still be able to breach the normal game logic until software patches or updates of the anti-cheating software are available. Moreover, the anti-cheating software themselves are also vulnerable to hacks. In this paper, we propose a ``scalable' ' and ``efficient'' method to detect whether a player is cheating or not. The methodology is based on the dynamic Bayesian network approach. The detection framework relies solely on the game states and runs in the game server only. Therefore it is invulnerable to hacks and it is a much more deployable solution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we implement a prototype multi-player game system to detect whether a player is using the ``aiming robot' ' for cheating or not.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{processing}} subgraph queries on a database that consists {{of a set of}} graphs. The answer to a subgraph query is the set of graphs in the database that are supergraphs of the query. In this article, we propose an efficient index, FG*-index, to solve this problem. The cost of processing a subgraph query using most existing indexes mainly consists of two parts, the index probing cost and the candidate verification cost. Index probing is to find the query in the index, or to find the graphs from which we can generate a candidate answer set for the query. Candidate verification is to test whether each graph in the candidate set is indeed a supergraph of the query. We design FG*-index to minimize these two costs as follows. FG*-index consists of three components: the FG-index, the feature-index, and the FAQ-index. First, the FG-index employs the concept of Frequent subGraph (FG) to allow the set of queries that are FGs to be answered without candidate verification. We call this set of queries FG-queries. We can enlarge the set of FG-queries so that more queries can be answered without candidate verification; however, a larger set of FG-queries implies a larger FG-index and hence the index probing cost also increases. We propose the feature-index to reduce the index probing cost. The feature-index uses features to filter false results that are matched in the FG-index, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|Dendrites are the post-synaptic {{sites of}} most {{excitatory}} and inhibitory synapses in the brain, making them the main location of cortical information processing and synaptic plasticity. Although current hypotheses suggest {{a central role}} for sleep in proper cognitive function and brain plasticity, virtually nothing is known about changes in dendritic activity across the sleep-wake cycle and how waking experience modifies this activity. To start addressing these questions, we developed a method that allows long-term recordings of EEGs/EMG combined with in vivo cortical calcium (Ca 2 +) activity in freely moving and sleeping rats. <b>We</b> measured <b>Ca</b> 2 + activity from populations of dendrites of layer (L) 5 pyramidal neurons (n = 13 rats) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> compared with <b>Ca</b> 2 + activity from populations of neurons in L 2 / 3 (n = 11 rats). L 5 and L 2 / 3 neurons were labelled using bolus injection of OGB 1 -AM or GCaMP 6 (1). Ca 2 + signals were detected using a fiber-optic system (cannula diameter = 400 µm), transmitting the changes in fluorescence to a photodiode. Ca 2 + fluctuations could then be correlated with ongoing changes in brain oscillatory activity during 5 major brain states: active wake [AW], quiet wake [QW], NREM, REM and NREM-REM transition (or intermediate state, [IS]). Our Ca 2 + recordings show large transients in L 5 dendrites and L 2 / 3 neurons that oscillate predominantly at frequencies In summary, <b>we</b> show <b>that</b> this technique is successful in monitoring fluctuations in ongoing dendritic Ca 2 + activity during natural brain states and allows, in principle, to combine behavioral measurement with imaging from various brain regions (e. g. deep structures) in freely behaving animals. Using this method, <b>we</b> show <b>that</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + transients from populations of L 2 / 3 neurons and L 5 dendrites are deferentially regulated across the sleep/wake cycle, with dendritic activity being the highest during the IS sleep. Our correlation analysis suggests that specific sleep EEG activity during NREM and IS, but not REM, has opposite effect on Ca 2 + activity in dendrites (positive correlation) and L 2 / 3 neurons (negative correlation). These results {{support the idea that}} specific sleep oscillations affect differently Ca 2 + activity fluctuations in different neuronal populations and/or cellular compartments. Behavioral manipulations (e. g. sleep deprivation [ongoing experiments], learning) will provide important information on the functional relevance of those observations and on the impact of waking experience on wake- and sleep-dependent dendritic activity changes. <br/...|$|R
