5|$|Saudi Arabia is an {{absolute}} monarchy, and has no legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. <b>The</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of <b>the</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E

The practice of Falun Gong is tolerated.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Laws</b> of Israel (חוקי היסוד, ħuqey ha-yesod) are the {{constitutional}} {{laws of the}} State of Israel.
