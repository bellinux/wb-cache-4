In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to {{only one of the}} parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked {{to take credit for}} public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, more {{commonly}} referred to as the New Cathedral, was designed by architect Ricardo Legorreta and inaugurated in 1993. The New Cathedral was built to replace the Old Cathedral downtown that had been damaged during the 1972 earthquake. Upon the completion of its construction, the New Cathedral generated controversy among tourists and locals because of its bland and dull appearance. Critics pointed to the fact that buildings of particular importance, especially those of colonial heritage, were painted in bright colors. Such a building whose intention was to serve as a place of worship was expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of vibrant color. Eventually, the church's original concrete and gray surface became accepted and Catholic pilgrims began to embrace the church as it was.|$|E

50|$|The {{main problem}} that the {{government}} is facing with the relocation is {{that a large number of}} the relocated people move back to Manila into a different shanty town due to the fact that they work in Manila and it is hard to find work in many other places on Luzon. Former Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay stated “Aside from livelihood, there should be transportation assistance”. He is referring <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of assisted transportation for these urban poor so that they can live in the suburbs and work every day in Manila.|$|R
25|$|Punulu (a {{house for}} menstruating women): {{this house is}} {{on the outside of}} the village. It is {{constructed}} by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings. Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They bring with them their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was {{involved}} in, as hinted {{in the opening}} couplet: [...] "I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me". Though Lennon never revealed whom he had an affair with, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave, or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] was a sarcastic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue (e.g. in guitarist Peter Asher's bedroom). McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: [...] "In our world the guy had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down {{as an act of}} revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental." ...|$|E

No one really knows but according to Alan Douglas, a noted radio historian, there might <b>have</b> been <b>some</b> [...] "dirt" [...] or material he had on certain RCA individuals that helped his case. Douglas mentions Bob Palmer, an old-time wireless man {{on the west coast}} who knew everyone including Cunningham. He did not have a high opinion of Cunningham and considered him [...] "lower than a snake in the grass". In summary Douglas says, [...] "No proof, but Cunningham <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of bargaining chip".|$|R

500|$|Since {{earning the}} {{position}} of Oslo City Council representative in 1984, Folkvord has used {{much of his time}} writing books about his political experiences and beliefs. His books have earned much attention by the Norwegian media. He has also collaborated on several books, the most notable being Rapport fra rottereiret – korrupsjon i Norge. In the book Folkvord claimed that Lise Harlem was involved in some sort of corruption in Norway, although to verify this he had only one source, Knut Frigaard. Harlem later wrote an article in Aftenposten stating that the book was [...] "dubiously" [...] written and [...] The book also received support from Carl August Fleischer and Liberal Party politician Helge Seip who defended the book against the accusations. Folkvord wrote Rødt! in 1998, a book about his tenure as a parliamentary representative. Twelve pages were about Folkvords four-year-term as representative, the other pages contained information criticising fellow parliamentary representatives. When writing the book, he wanted it <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of impact on Red Youth members and other left of center groups or activists. Operasjon Heilomvending, published in 2007, contained a large amount of criticism of the Socialist Left Party, the Labour Party and the Red-Green Coalition in general. The book Vår korrupte hovedstad (...) , was published in 2011. In 2015 his book [...] Det store Oslo-ranet was published.|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature. We also wanted it <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell {{came up with the}} idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car. Because he did not know how long the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, and what has been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{fire engine}} is an apparatus designed primarily for firefighting operations. The {{primary purpose of the}} engine is transporting firefighters to the scene, providing a limited supply of water with which to fight the fire, and carrying [...] tools, equipment, and hoses needed by the firefighters. The tools carried on the fire engine will vary greatly based on many factors including the size of the department and what sort of terrain the department must handle. For example, departments located near large bodies of water or rivers are likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of water rescue equipment. Standard tools found on nearly all fire engines include ladders, hydraulic rescue tools (often referred to as the jaws of life), floodlights, fire hose, fire extinguishers, self-contained breathing apparatus, and thermal imaging cameras.|$|E

Although he later recanted, acknowledging the unique scope of this experiment and contributed to its success as a consultant, in a 1983 interview (8 years {{before the start of the}} experiment), Prance said, [...] "I was attracted to the Institute of Ecotechnics because funds for research were being cut and the institute seemed to have a lot of money which it was willing to spend freely.

[...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be."

2500|$|In the meantime, Tavora and Eanes {{arrived in}} Asilah. [...] The elder Castro's death {{led to a}} little confusion, but once it was {{clarified}} that Noronha was indeed officially relieved, the transfer request was forwarded by Muley Buquer to Fez. [...] Tavora and Eanes sent their own representative, a Portuguese Jew known only as 'Mestre José' (Master Joseph), to accompany the request and presumably escort Ferdinand back to Asilah. [...] Arriving in Fez in May, the emissaries presented the vizier Abu Zakariya with sealed letters from Peter of Coimbra confirming Noronha's dismissal {{and a copy of}} the royal instructions given to Castro to evacuate Ceuta. But Abu Zakariya refused to assent to the transfer request. Instead, the vizier replied that Ferdinand would remain in Fez and that he would fulfill the swap himself once Ceuta was evacuated. [...] What followed is a bit murky. [...] Master Joseph was accused (and confessed to) being part of a scheme to help Ferdinand escape, and was himself arrested and thrown into a cell. [...] The detention of Master Joseph (which lasted until September) gave Abu Zakariya time to assemble a Moroccan army for a triumphal march to Ceuta, intending to garrison the citadel {{as soon as it was}} evacuated. Abu Zakariaya set out in processional array from Fez, taking Ferdinand along with him, promising to hand him over as soon as he took possession of the city. [...] Master Joseph was released and sent back to Asilah to report the change of plans to Tavora and Eanes. It is uncertain what else the emissary reported about Abu Zakariya's intentions, but the Portuguese ambassadors rejected the offer, arguing they were not prepared to [...] "hock Ceuta for paper promises", that they needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of hold on Ferdinand's person.

[...] Master Joseph arrived in Fez in May 1440 and presented Abu Zakariya with sealed letters from Peter of Coimbra that contained copies of the order for Noronha's dismissal and the evacuation instructions given to Fernando de Castro. [...] What happened thereafter is murky. Ferdinand himself was called to an audience before Abu Zakariya, with Joseph present, to be asked if he wanted to return to Asilah. While escorting Ferdinand back to his dungeon, Abu Zakariya's guards [...] "found" [...] a secret note on him, which they said Master Joseph had slipped to him during the audience. [...] Master Joseph was accused of a scheming to help Ferdinand escape and was promptly detained. Álvares believes this was all a ruse by Abu Zakariya to gain some time. [...] Abu Zakariya sought to reap the glory of recovering Ceuta and needed time to assemble an army in Fez for a triumphal march on Ceuta. [...] In September 1440, once the army was assembled, Master Joseph was finally released and sent back to Asilah without Ferdinand, carrying only Abu Zakariya's promise to undertake the swap himself, i.e. that he would personally take Ferdinand to Ceuta and release him upon taking control of the city.
