Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT <b>time</b> <b>check.</b> One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainfall}} lightened {{almost as}} soon as it began, but the top riders in the general classification still faced a course made more difficult by the rain. Most of them rode conservatively, to keep their positions intact rather than aim for the stage win, but Danilo Di Luca did not. Di Luca attacked the course, riding with a high cadence from the outset. He had the best time at the first intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check,</b> but he lost energy and faded away as the course went on, finishing 45 seconds slower than the stage winner.|$|E

A homeowner measured from the waterline on his house to a point equal {{to the top of the}} levee using a laser level and discovered that the levee had been under approximately 56inches (4.5feet) of water.|$|E
25|$|By Wednesday, June 18, {{the waters}} had receded greatly, leaving {{remnants}} {{only in the}} <b>Time</b> <b>Check</b> neighborhood {{on the west bank}} of the river and the Czech Village district, which lies on both sides of the river. Importantly, most bridges had been reopened, relieving the stress on the I-380 which had been the only crossing that remained open (and only then with severe restrictions on who could cross). While downtown became accessible, power remained off, and traffic signals were out; this is because transformers in underground vaults were still receiving water. Water restrictions which imposed limits on use were also eased, and people were allowed the use of showers and washing machines.|$|E

500|$|Simon Špilak (...) was {{the first}} of the general {{classification}} contenders to beat Martin; his time was 20' 36". This was enough to beat many of the other contenders for the overall classification: Rui Costa (...) , Geraint Thomas (...) and Michał Kwiatkowski (...) all finished behind Špilak. Porte, in second place overnight, was the only rider able to beat Špilak's time: Porte was 11 seconds ahead at the intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check</b> and finished the stage 13 seconds ahead.|$|E
500|$|The {{seventh and}} {{final stage of}} the 2015 Tirreno–Adriatico was another {{individual}} time trial. This stage was [...] in length and took place entirely in the resort of San Benedetto del Tronto on the Adriatic seafront. The course was an out-and-back route. It first headed south, through an intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check</b> after , {{to a pair of}} 90-degree right hand turns halfway through the course. The course then headed north on almost entirely straight roads. The stage was flat throughout with no significant climbs.|$|E

500|$|The final rider {{to set off}} was {{the race}} leader Tony Gallopin (...) [...] Gallopin was 36 seconds ahead of Porte {{overnight}} and expressed hope {{that he would be}} able to defend his lead and take overall victory. Immediately after he set off, however, he was nervous and uncomfortable on his bike. (Gallopin, like most of the riders, was riding a conventional road bike with aero bars attached.) At the intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check,</b> he was already 58 seconds behind Porte; he lost another 41 seconds in the second part of the stage. His time of 22' 02" [...] meant he finished 29th on the stage and lost the yellow jersey. He dropped to sixth place overall.|$|E
500|$|The nineteenth leg {{featured}} {{only one}} categorized climb, which Iñaki Gastón won to seal his {{victory in the}} mountains classification. The stage saw no major time disparities in the general classification contenders as they finished together, with Bugno taking the stage win. The penultimate stage of the race was a [...] individual time trial that contained one un-categorized climb within the route. Race leader Chioccioli took the course and at the first <b>time</b> <b>check</b> at [...] he had already put thirty seconds into Bugno. He ended up winning the stage by fifty-seconds over Bugno, thereby extending his lead {{over the rest of}} his competitors. The final stage culminated with a bunch sprint that was won by Cipollini. Chioccioli had won the Giro d'Italia for the first time by almost four minutes over the second-place finisher Chiappucci.|$|E
500|$|The Tour {{came down}} to the stage 20 time trial in Grenoble. While Evans was {{certainly}} the stronger of the two in the event, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial in the 2010 Tour de France and there was speculation as to whether the Luxembourger had enough time in hand to win the Tour with his 57-second cushion. They were the last two riders on the course, and rode diametrically different time trials. About an hour earlier, Tony Martin had set a dominant best time, finishing more than a minute better than any other rider in the field. Evans rode one of the best time trials of his life, seconds off Martin's pace at each <b>time</b> <b>check</b> and only seven seconds the lesser of him at the finish line. Schleck's ride was unremarkable, ceding two and a half minutes to Evans by finishing 17th on the day. What had been speculated to be a close challenge ended up being no challenge at all [...] Evans took the race lead by over a minute and a half. Since the Tour's final stage is largely ceremonial and not competitive for the overall classification, the time trial clinched the Tour for Evans, the first Grand Tour win in Evans' long top-level career that had featured three previous podiums and six previous top-tens. All nine BMC riders reached the Tour's finish. Evans' triumph meant that Hincapie set a new record as the only man ever to ride on nine Tour-winning squads.|$|E

Leonardo Piepoli started slowly, well behind Zabriskie at the [...] intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check,</b> but finished strongly, gaining 4 seconds on Zabriskie at the [...] check and 18 at the finish line. ' Evgeni Petrov posted the best time at the first intermediate <b>time</b> <b>check,</b> but faded as the course wore on and could not beat Piepoli's time. Riccardo Riccò, Franco Pellizotti, Andy Schleck, Damiano Cunego, and Gilberto Simoni all posted solid times, but all fell short of overtaking Piepoli.|$|E
2500|$|Stage 19 was {{the final}} time trial. It was widely {{expected}} that Contador would increase his lead over Schleck, {{who in the past}} had struggled in this discipline, but the initial going surprised all as Schleck set a high pace that Contador had difficulty matching. By the first <b>time</b> <b>check</b> Schleck had picked up six seconds, cutting Contador's overall lead to just two seconds on the road. By the second <b>time</b> <b>check</b> Contador had recovered his losses and extended his lead over Schleck by six seconds. Over the final third of the course Contador extended his advantage, gaining an additional twenty-five seconds on his rival for an overall gain of thirty-one seconds for the stage. [...] Fabian Cancellara, the Olympic and World Time Trial Champion, won the stage by seventeen seconds over runner-up Tony Martin. In addition Denis Menchov was able to overtake Samuel Sánchez for third place overall, while Ryder Hesjedal was able to move in front of Joaquim Rodríguez for the seventh place slot in the GC. Contador's first-place lead increased to 39 seconds, essentially guaranteeing him the victory.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the waters}} receded, flooded {{buildings}} were inspected by [...] "strike teams" [...] before owners {{were allowed to}} return {{and check out the}} damage. They used a color-coded system. Green meant the building was safe for occupancy, yellow meant entry should be limited and at one's own risk, red indicated serious damage/no entry, and purple was later used for buildings which were to be demolished. In biggest problems with homes were collapsing basements or foundations. In cases where water had reached the first floor or higher, there was failure of the floor joists, leading to a sagging or collapse into the basement. The <b>Time</b> <b>Check</b> neighborhood is particularly hard hit, where several hundred homes were said to be beyond salvation and will be demolished.|$|E
2500|$|About 1,300 blocks or 10 square miles, {{including}} {{most of the}} downtown area, were inundated, with more than 5,000 homes being affected.

Buildings that did not suffer any first floor damage had flooded basements. The Czech Village, <b>Time</b> <b>Check,</b> and Cedar Valley/Rompot districts in particular sustained significant damage. The city's domestic water distribution was compromised, as {{all but one of the}} city's wells were flooded, and water usage restrictions were imposed; however through a massive sandbagging effort the city's last remaining well was kept operational throughout the disaster.

Bernhard Kohl rode an unexpectedly good time trial, gaining slightly on Sastre and riding almost identically to Evans at the first two <b>time</b> <b>checks,</b> despite having fallen off the starthouse ramp before his ride began. Sastre was consistent and strong, riding one of his best ever time trials, catching Fränk Schleck and riding well enough to keep his yellow jersey for the ride to Paris.|$|R
