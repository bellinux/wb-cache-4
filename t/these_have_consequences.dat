The authors propose a methodology and tool to easily perform preliminary spaceport site evaluation, which considers runway length & surface, local weather conditions, existing air & ground traffic, and safety for the uninvolved public. All of <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> on site selection for a spaceport. The authors briefly present the potential legal framework for suborbital flights in France {{with the objective of}} finding an acceptable regulatory framework. Due to the absence of explicit requirements, the U. S. regulations established by the FAA-AST have been used as a guideline to frame the scope of the investigations. A methodology has been developed and a weighting established for various criteria to rate any selected airport. Matlab and C scripts were authored to automate data intensive aspects of the analysis. A simplified aerodynamic model for two representative space planes were developed to provide trajectory data for nominal and nonnominal flight. Data tables were created through manual entry and automated databases extraction to provide the input for the overall analysis. This paper shows a case study of the airport in Montpellier, France, with a flight path directly over the Mediterranean sea. The overall study shows that several airports in France are acceptable and justify further investigations regarding their feasibilit...|$|E
40|$|Various {{theories}} and approaches {{have been introduced}} in the debate on how to address sustainable consumption. In this study, we first discuss different theoretical perspectives on sustainable consumption, particularly developed {{in the fields of}} economics, social psychology and environmental sociology. We argue that neither an ‘individualist’ nor a system- or structural perspective alone is sufficient for understanding and analysing the transition towards sustainable consumption. Therefore, we propose to apply the Social Practices Approach (SPA) that combines both human agency and social structures to understand sustainable consumption issues. Following the SPA framework, we review and summarize research on sustainable consumption in China in particular on three consumption fields: food, housing energy and mobility. It is found that introducing more efficient production technology is commonly taken as the focal point in these sectors when sustainable consumption was introduced to China. Despite a rising interest in consumers' perceptions of products' sustainability in recent years, research has rarely paid any attention to consumers' behavioural change or to the transition dynamics towards sustainable consumption. In general, ‘individualist’ perspectives have largely dominated Chinese sustainable consumption research. This paper proposes to move attention {{to a better understanding of}} Chinese consumption issues by emphasizing the link between the provision of sustainable products and the diverse sustainable consumption practices. Also, images of food, energy, mobility and other consumption products that are undergoing transitions need to be considered in future research as <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for socio-technical changes, material infrastructures and for ‘lifestyle’ innovations. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{practices}} of domestic regulation of media within the family, focusing on parental attempts to manage children’s {{access to and}} use of new media, while also recognising that <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for children’s attempts to manage their own access to and use of media, even if this means tactics to evade parental control. Theoretically, the paper seeks to integrate the specific literature on domestic rules and regulation of media use with the broader literature on the rules and roles in social situations, arguing that parental strategies in relation to domestic media reveal both the enactment of and the negotiations over the typically informal and implicit rules and roles in family life. These issues are explored using data from two surveys: (1) the ‘Young People, New Media’ project surveyed 1300 children and their parents, examining the social, relational and contextual factors that shape {{the ways in which}} families develop rules for managing the introduction of the personal computer and the multiplication of television sets, among other new media changes, in the home; (2) the ‘UK Children Go Online’ project surveyed 1500 children and their parents, updating the picture by examining the introduction of the internet into the family home. On the basis of these data, it is argued that despite the ‘newness’ of media as they successively arrive in the home, there are considerable consistencies over time in the responses of families, it being the slow-to-change relations between parents and children that shape patterns of domestic regulation and use...|$|E
40|$|Grazing, {{fuelwood}} extraction {{and burning}} are common human activities in Indian forests. These activities can represent forest disturbances that drive {{the degradation of}} natural deciduous forest cover to scrub forest, with concurrent impacts on soils. The effects of human forest use on ecosystem functions were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in Peninsular India. This paper reports the impacts on surface soils. Soils were sampled from 200 locations covering four watersheds within the Park. These samples spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). Soil physical, nutrient and hydraulic properties were measured. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were analyzed as key response variables describing nutrient availability and infiltration respectively. Effects of cattle and jeep trails on infiltration and bulk density were evaluated by sampling on-and-off trails. Trail density in research watersheds was estimated with satellite imagery. Soil nutrient availability is negatively impacted by disturbance, resulting from negative impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay content. Available water capacity (AWC) and saturated moisture content (SMC) were significantly higher in protected watersheds, attributed to reduced clay content in degraded watersheds. Off trails, high spatial variability in infiltration overwhelmed any meaningful trends with disturbance. However, infiltration was substantially reduced on trails {{as a result of}} significant increase in bulk density. The density of trails was considerably higher in degraded watersheds compared to protected watersheds. These results provide ground-based and remotely sensed evidence that forest disturbance within the Park has negative impacts on soil organic matter, nutrient availability and hydraulic characteristics. <b>These</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for related ecological, nutrient cycling and hydrological processes, and the continuation of the services currently enjoyed by local human populations.

40|$|ECGI - Law Working Paper No. 38 / 2005 This Working Paper {{is based}} upon a draft {{prepared}} for the EU Corporate Law Making Conference (Cambridge, October 29 - 30, 2004) organized by Harvard Law School and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) [URL] question whether regulatory competition {{in the area of}} company law could take place in the European Union (EU) in a way similar to the form it takes in the United States (the Delaware phenomenon) is topical because of some recent judgments of the European Court of Justice and various documents and projects produced by the European Commission. That question is typically discussed, however, as if voters did not count and as if competition among governments was exclusively based on the mobility of firms across jurisdictions. But intergovernmental competition can also take the form of yardstick, or relative performance, competition. Voters and democratic politics then become essential. Voters assess the performance of incumbents by comparing what obtains in their own and in other jurisdictions. The first part of the paper is devoted to spelling out some characteristics of the mechanism. It notes in particular that, depending on circumstances, yardstick competition may provide office-holders with the wrong incentives. This result is important in the EU context. The second part stresses some aspects of the path followed by European integration. One property is that Europe is under construction, entailing a tendency for integration to be monotonous. The process of integration can slow down or stall but seldom if ever regress. Another feature is the enduring reliance on the internal market commitments and their legal implications. Structural characteristics of the integration process such as <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> on yardstick competition {{as well as on the}} kind of policies to be expected from the EU. The third and fourth parts of the paper are devoted to corporate governance and law making in the EU context and in the light of the foregoing analysis of yardstick competition. Two points are stressed. The nature of yardstick competition among the governments of the member countries may explain that differences in company law and corporate governance can subsist without preventing a strong convergence of economic outcomes. Yardstick competition between the EU as a whole and other parts of the world, however, is likely to start a dynamic process that could lead to the centralization of a large part of company lawmaking at the EU level and the emergence of a distinctive legal environment for firms doing business in Europe...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetism}} of lamellar copper oxides, {{which are}} the parent materials of high temperature superconductors, {{is dominated by the}} spin 1 / 2 Cu+ 2 ions on the CuO 2 planes. The magnetic behavior of these planes at high temperature is described well by the planar quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (AFM) model, which has long range order only at T = 0. In fact they have three dimensional AFM order due to weak spin anisotropies and interplane couplings. Starting from a Hubbard model with spin orbit and Coulomb exchange couplings, we first derive an effective single-bond magnetic Hamiltonian which contains these anisotropies and couplings. Using a simple Coulomb interaction, as used by Moriya, reveals an interesting hidden symmetry which implies a rotationally symmetric interaction. For orthorhombic LCO, this symmetry is removed only when one adds the different bonds on the lattice, yielding a net Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya antisymmetric anisotropy. In tetragonal symmetry, the zero point quantum spin wave energy (QZPE) generates additional four-fold symmetry terms and delicate higher order interplane interactions, which help select a ground state among states which would otherwise be degenerate due to frustration. Adding several more interplanar interactions yields the full effective magnetic Hamiltonian, which is then used to identify the magnetic structures and competitions among them, leading to phase diagrams in parameter space. These are also used to discuss the critical phenomena which occur near various possible transitions. Specific attention will be devoted to the structures of tetragonal Sr 2 CuO 2 Cl 2, Nd 2 CuO 4 and Pr 2 CuO 4. In the former, frustration among layers is lifted by pseudodipolar interactions and by QZPE. In the latter two, the rare earth also participates in the magnetism. Finally, we give full analysis of Sr 2 Cu 3 O 4 Cl 2, which contains Cu 3 O 4 planes with an extra Cu ion in the center of every second Cu plaquette. Each of the two types of Cu ions reaches AFM order separately and the system also exhibits an interesting ferromagnetic moment. A theory in which the intersublattice coupling is described by pseudodipolar Interactions allows us to deduce various coupling constants. Similarities in the relative Cu-O-Cu geometries enable us to relate these coupling constants to the nearest and next nearest neighbor interactions in many chain, ladder and lamellar cuprates. <b>These</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> concerning the magnetic behavior of the latter systems: competing nearest and next nearest neighbor couplings may explain the spin gap observed in the chains, and the new pseudodipolar interactions remove frustration in the interladder coupling...|$|E
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of Sphagnum carpets were marked with plastic mesh {{and one year}} later the production of plant matter was harvested in four ombrotrophic bogs from two regions of southern Germany: Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern, OB) and the Northern Black Forest (Nordschwarzwald, NBF). Radioactive, 210 Pb was determined in solid samples using ultralow background gamma spectrometry while total Pb concentrations and stable isotopes (206 Pb, 207 Pb, 208 Pb) were determined in acid digests using ICP-SMS. Up to 12 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected per site, and 6 to 10 sites investigated per bog. The greatest variations within a given sampling site were in the range 212 - 532 Bq kg- 1 for 210 Pb activity, whereas 206 Pb/ 207 Pb and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb varied less than 1 %. The median values of all parameters for the sites (6 - 10 per bog) were not significantly different. The median activities of 210 Pb (Bq kg- 1) in the mosses collected from the bogs in NBF (HO = 372 ± 56, n= 55; WI = 342 ± 58, n= 93) were slightly less from those in OB (GS = 394 ± 50, n= 55; KL = 425 ± 58, n= 24). However, the mosses in the NBF bogs exhibited much greater productivity (187 to 202 g m- 2 a- 1) compared to those of OB (71 to 91 g m- 2 a- 1), and this has {{a profound impact on}} the accumulation rates of 210 Pb (Bq m- 2 a- 1), with the bogs in the NBF yielding fluxes (HO = 73 ± 30; WI = 65 ± 20) which are twice those of OB (GS = 29 ± 11; KL = 40 ± 13). Using the air concentrations of 210 Pb measured at Schauinsland (SIL) in the southern Black Forest and average annual precipitation, the atmospheric fluxes of 210 Pb at SIL (340 Bq m- 2 a- 1) exceeds the corresponding values obtained from the mosses by a factor of five, providing the first quantitative estimate of the retention efficiency of 210 Pb by Sphagnum. When the 210 Pb activities of all moss samples are combined (n= 227), a significant decrease with increasing plant production rate is observed; in contrast, total Pb concentrations show the opposite trend. The contrasting behaviour of 210 Pb and total Pb in the mosses may reflect differences in the particle size distribution of the corresponding aerosols, their physical and chemical properties, the extent of their interaction with plant surfaces, or some combination of these factors. The 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios from NBF (HO = 1. 159 ± 0. 002, n= 19; WI = 1. 157 ± 0. 003, n= 48) and OB (GS = 1. 157 ± 0. 003, n= 28; KL = 1. 159 ± 0. 003, n= 15) are uniform, indicating that both regions are impacted by Pb from predominately anthropogenic sources. Although Sphagnum moss represents an established receptor in monitoring atmospheric Pb deposition, the physical characteristics (size, morphology, composition) of the three predominant kinds of Pb-bearing aerosols considered here, namely 210 Pb (adsorbed onto aerosol surfaces, following decay of 222 Rn), anthropogenic Pb (sub-micron aerosols from high temperature combustion processes) and soilderived mineral dusts (tens of microns, from chemical weathering of crustal rocks), are fundamentally different and <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for the retention efficiency of the three kinds of particles.

40|$|This Thesis is {{intended}} {{to make a contribution}} to the growing literature concerned with learning in the workplace. It presents a detailed analysis of learning in one type of work activity - air traffic control. This particular work activity was chosen because it embodies features that represent the future of work for many other industries (e. g., information service provision mediated by information technologies; a high reliance on communication skills and collaborative work; increasing complexity and intensity of the work activity), within an organisational context undergoing considerable change. The organisation chosen and the type of work selected provides an example of the kind of national policy reform that has been occurring in Australia over the past decade. It also provides an example of how change is strongly influencing the nature of the work. Within this organisation, technological and organisational reform is leading to changes in work practice and to changes in relationships between workers within the organisation and <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for workplace learning. This Thesis addresses the question: In what ways do organisational structures and cultures enable and constrain learning in the workplace? The basic premise of the Thesis is that the lived experiences of people at work are significantly influenced by their contexts (in organisations most commonly conceptualised as structures and cultures) and that these contexts are in turn reproduced or transformed by people. At the heart of this Thesis is a concern to understand how these processes interact so that we may create educative work environments in workplace organisations. It is argued in the Thesis that learning occurs in a range of ways in the workplace, most notably, as formal and informal learning. Formal learning occurs as part of formalised and workplace accredited programs, embedded within the organisation's authority and accountability structure. This kind of learning (often referred to as training) has a finite end point, and results in a qualification or licence to undertake specific work activity. Learning also occurs informally, as part of everyday work and it too is influenced by organisational contexts. This study explores how changing organisational cultures and structures influence formal and informal workplace learning. By investing in certain cultural beliefs and values, for example, individuals within the workplace both enable and constrain their own opportunities for learning and those of workplace colleagues. Moreover, organisational structures (e. g., the design of work, including processes of authority and accountability) also enhance and inhibit learning opportunities. It is argued that as the pace of organisational and technological change continues to accelerate, greater attention needs to be given to the factors that enable and constrain both formal and. informal learning so that learning becomes a continuous process embedded within everyday work practice. Continuous learning occurs, then, when individuals engage in learning processes continuously and where these processes are embedded within work activity and contexts (within structures and cultures). Continuous learning is important in industries undergoing change and particularly in those workplaces characterised by high performance work (such as air traffic control). The Thesis is based on a qualitative study of learning in the air traffic control workplace. The data set is based on 100 semi-structured interviews conducted in three air traffic control workplaces, observations of air traffic control work practices, and the author's active participation as a training provider and process facilitator within a range of organisational change events. The study used an interpretive methodological approach including interviews and observations to attend to the features of social interaction. The data were examined also for the presence of structural and cultural phenomena. In this way, the study provides an explanation {{of the way in which}} social structure, culture and history interweave with the activity of learning at work and helps shape the nature and organisation of learning in work activity. The study seeks to extend existing literature and understanding by attempting to integrate concepts from psychological approaches to learning with situated understandings of the importance of contextual influences found in cultures and communities of practice, together with organisational theories of work organisation. Thus, the study offers a bridge between learning and organisational theory in a way that can assist both organisational designers and facilitators of workplace learning. The research concludes that the ways in which organisational structures and cultures enable and constrain learning can be identified. Furthermore, it" demonstrates that organisational change processes of recent years have fundamentally altered the ways in which people learn about the complex organisations and systems within which they work with both positive and negative results for learning. A model is presented that identifies and defines elements in the learning process and the ways in which structural and cultural contexts are implicated in those processes within the workplace. The model identifies structural and cultural elements that need to be present to achieve a goal of continuous learning and to thereby to make possible the creation of educative work environments. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} site {{has been the}} Södra Cell Tofte pulp mill. The main focus in this thesis is how to learn about process control. The need for research on this theme is given implicitly in the foundation and construction of the INPRO programme. Norwegian engineering education is discipline oriented, and the INPRO programme aimed at integrating the three disciplines engineering cybernetics, chemical engineering, and organisation and work life science in a single PhD programme. One goal was to produce knowledge of modern production in chemical process plants based on socio-technical thinking. In the introduction I outline how my research questions have been developed {{and the need for}} doing research in the field of improving process understanding in a continuous process plant. This thesis provides answer to the three questions: 1. What are the learning systems for workers in a process plant? 2. What is the implication for learning of different socio-technical structures? 3. How can learning be further improved for workers in the process industry? In order to answer these questions and to provide a background for why these questions are important to Tofte, I describe and analyse the case plant Södra Cell Tofte. I find it necessary to make this part rather extensive in order for the reader to understand the context under which Tofte has been developing its learning arenas or learning systems. I use a sociotechnical framework in doing this. I want to introduce and use this framework as I regard it as useful for one of my purposes with this work: Assisting the production unit at Tofte to improve learning. I go through technological improvements that have been carried out from 1980 onwards, and one major organisational change that has taken place. The downsizing and reorganisation that took place in 1992 is of importance as well as the organisational development effort named “Employeeship” that took place in 1996. I had a leave from the INPRO project for almost a year following and evaluating this particular project. The situation at Tofte in 1994 was lack of good learning systems, and after a major reorganisation in 1992 the organisation defined a need for better responsibility distribution and co-operation. Chapters 3 and 4 present and discuss theories in order to give a broader background for the research issues in this thesis. In Chapter three I discuss features and characteristics of a continuous process plant as <b>these</b> <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> on how knowledge and skills can be developed and why process understanding is a necessity. I present socio-technical system thinking (STS) as one way of regarding organisation and management of a process plant, and I further discuss why I find this approach appropriate for providing learning primarily at the shop floor level as an integrated part of daily production. In Chapter four I argue that knowledge and skills in production are becoming increasingly important in highly automated remotely controlled process plants and develop a theory of “process understanding”. Process understanding is defined as the ability to predict {{what is going to happen}}. In order to predict what is going to happen with a system one firstly need to define the system boundaries. This system can then be regarded as a mental model. One must know and analyse input variables (know where and how to get relevant process information), and by this anticipate, like in a mental simulation, what will happen with the parameters within a defined time period. Different possible options may be mentally tested including what will happen if no corrective actions are taken. An ability to predict what is going to happen with the product, to process equipment or any other process variable, has to be developed and refined in order to operate a process plant optimally. Theories state that a variety of knowledge and skills are required and that some skills can be acquired only through years of experience. The “knowing why” within a process plant also has to be strengthen in order to develop a better process understanding, but as an addition to the experience based “knowing how”. Models of learning regarding the demands given by the production systems in order to develop such process understanding are presented and discussed. These are conventional methods, experiential (problem based) learning, and collective learning. The experiential learning model is discussed and what may inhibit learning from experiences to take place in a plant. I have defined the concept “learning arena” and regarded each shift in a control room as a main learning arena since this is the place where theory meets practice. It is further discussed that practice will differ between shifts within same control room due to different mental models of the process. In various learning arenas, different communities-ofpractice must be joined in order to make more shared mental models with the intention to align different practices. In Chapter five the research methods used to explore the research questions, and thus to bring forth theories about gaining better process control, are reviewed. I have been inspired by action research methods in order to answer my research questions and to contribute in a necessary change process where development and use of learning arenas have been central. I have been more or less active in these arenas and played back experiences and theories in order to further develop the arenas. Besides participations in learning arenas, methods have been interviews, observations, and written documentations. Chapter six is the case description of two different kinds of learning systems at Tofte: Operator Training (OT) - Operator based development and execution of education/ training and Operations Workshop (OW) - Problem based learning aiming at better production practice. I have provided background for the two cases as an answer to the educational challenges Tofte had in 1996 and not least to differences in operational practice between shifts. I describe background, characteristics, and development from what I term different learning arenas where the learning about process control will take place. I have also discussed in what ways these two learning systems can be regarded as learning arenas and briefly the kind of learning that can take place in each arena. In two Operations workshops I provide more details in order to show some strengths of the method. In Chapter seven I provide answers to the three research questions outlined in the introduction and further refined in Chapter 4. 5. I analyse how different learning types such as individual, experiential, and collective are covered within different learning arenas and how OT and OW meet the requirements for good learning systems in continuous process plants. Further I analyse how tasks regarding education and training are better distributed in a shift and daytime organisation with the two learning systems, and further how learning is integrated with working and thus process operators’ knowledge and skills are better utilised. When I analyse the implication of learning of two different socio-technical structures, I also regard how managers are better enabled to become facilitators for learning. The two arenas have been well established at Tofte, but to a varying degree in the different departments. When regarding Operator training it is still too early to conclude on its impact on results in the pulp mill. However, two Operations workshops have made positive contributions and demonstrated the potential of the method. The strengths of the methods are the collective learning that place in cogenerated learning arenas. In Operator training this strengthens the master-apprentice method, and in Operations workshops it gives a shared understanding and direction for further tasks in process control. Finally, based on the analysis of the first two questions I discuss how learning for workers can be further improved. In Chapter eighth I conclude on my theoretical contribution and arguments for further research in the actual fields. Finally, based on my findings I will recommend organisational choices on future actions. STS provides frames and directions for learning to take place within groups along the production line. It is however not the scope of the STS paradigm to provide theories of what constitutes knowledge in operations of a plant. And the STS theories are not developed in order to cover more specifically models for how learning within and across semi-autonomous units and organisational levels may take place. Thus the main contribution of this thesis is learning theories based on two different kinds of learning models as means to develop process understanding. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

However, {{the lack of}} notice {{of copyright}} using <b>these</b> marks may <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit — using notices of this form may {{reduce the likelihood of}} a defense of [...] "innocent infringement" [...] being successful.|$|R
30|$|It {{is useful}} to provide a {{literature}} review of existing methods for grapheme to phoneme mappings before presenting our algorithm. Traditional Arabic literature provides a rich set of pronunciation rules for classical Arabic (Nassir 1985). Recent publications provide pronunciation rules for modern Arabic extracted from traditional sources. However, some of the rules that should be included are excluded, while others that should be left out are incorporated. <b>These</b> <b>have</b> significant <b>consequences</b> on phonetization and recognition accuracy, as these situations arise quite frequently, and hence pronunciation produced using <b>these</b> rules would <b>have</b> many errors.|$|R
50|$|Each of <b>these</b> {{immediate}} <b>consequences</b> <b>has</b> multiple secondary effects. For instance, heat {{affects the}} crystalline {{structure of the}} electrode material. This in turn can influence reaction rate, and/or accelerate dendrite formation, and/or deform the plates, and/or precipitate thermal runaway.|$|R

The curriculum and assessment framework of the Australian Curriculum: Science is evaluated and aspects of its structure are found to lack some cohesion and definition. <b>These</b> flaws <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> for school curriculum leaders and teachers of science, in particular those teachers who are less experienced. A flexible model of curriculum interpretation together with assessment criteria and standards is proposed which should facilitate the planning of coherent science programs and allow teachers to make and validate assessment judgements. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} {{this article focuses on}} how policy {{discourse}} and research discourse meet in contract research in higher education. The interplay of <b>these</b> discourses <b>has</b> <b>consequences</b> for researchers who have to balance conflicting demands, which we view as links between research and policy cycles. Two evaluation studies on the introduction and effects of new policy instruments are discussed, focusing on the interaction between policy needs, and research design. The examples are taken from policies in the development towards increasing self-regulation in higher education, of which Finland and the Netherlands are interesting examples in the European context...|$|R
50|$|In FO {{processes}} we {{may have}} solute diffusion in both directions depending on {{the composition of the}} draw solution and the feed water. This does two things; the draw solution solutes may diffuse to the feed solution and the feed solution solutes may diffuse to the draw solution. Clearly <b>these</b> phenomena <b>have</b> <b>consequences</b> in terms of the selection of the draw solution for any particular FO process. For instance the loss of draw solution may affect the feed solution perhaps due to environmental issues or contamination of the feed stream, such as in osmotic membrane bioreactors.|$|R
5000|$|While several smaller {{raptorial}} {{birds will}} attack humans {{if they come}} {{too close to the}} nesting site, usually <b>these</b> <b>have</b> minor <b>consequences</b> for the human victim. Mother crowned eagles, in the post-fledging stage, readily attack any human who comes close to the nest; adult males may also attack humans before fledging but only do so rarely. Despite the size and power of the eagle, attacks by the eagles may <b>have</b> minor <b>consequences</b> as well since the attacks are meant only to displace and not kill or seriously maim the intruding animal. However, nest-defense attacks may nonetheless possibly result in deep, painful, open wounds, which can lead to risk of infection or the need for stitches.|$|R
