50|$|In {{comparison}} with the previous season, the calendar saw the discontinuation of the Algarve round {{and the return of}} EuroSpeedway Lausitz; Autodromo Nazionale Monza, which was also due to reappear on 23-24 July as the tenth round—subject <b>to</b> <b>track</b> homologation—was <b>removed</b> from the calendar on 1 April 2016; the round was definitively cancelled the following 29 April, as no replacement venue had ultimately been found.|$|R
50|$|In November 1996, {{the track}} was {{purchased}} by Don Panoz, who would make Braselton the base of operations for his motorsports-related ventures. Panoz introduced the first major changes <b>to</b> the <b>track,</b> <b>removing</b> the Dip and creating a chicane {{at the end of}} the long back straight. These changes brought the <b>track</b> up <b>to</b> FIA standards, so that international events could be held. A new pit and paddock area was also constructed on the infield side of the track, allowing for larger events, and a 10,000-seat terrace area was constructed around the new Turn 10 complex.|$|R

50|$|Another {{method to}} {{mitigate}} the effects of duping would be a rollback, in which game data is reset to an earlier data backup prior to the first known instance of duping. This can include all game data or be limited to specific items, characters, or other means determined {{to be involved in}} the duping. Significant rollbacks can be a highly unpopular decision with the players and is best done before much time has passed. Alternately, SOE was able <b>to</b> <b>track</b> and <b>remove</b> the duped currency in EverQuest II.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Performance {{profiling}} of MPI programs generates overhead during execution that introduces {{error in}} profile measurements. It is possible <b>to</b> <b>track</b> and <b>remove</b> overhead online, {{but it is}} necessary to communicate execution delay between processes to correctly adjust their interdependent timing. We demonstrate the first implementation of a onlne measurement overhead compensation system for profiling MPI programs. This is implemented in the TAU performance systems. It requires novel techniques for delay communication in the use of MPI. The ability to reduce measurement error is demonstrated for problematic test cases and real applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reactive jamming is {{not only}} cost effective, but also hard <b>to</b> <b>track</b> and <b>remove</b> due <b>to</b> its {{intermittent}} jamming behaviors. Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) {{have been widely used}} to defend against jamming attacks. However, both will fail if the jammer jams all frequency channels or has high transmit power. In this paper, we propose BitTrickle, an anti-jamming wireless communication scheme that allows communication {{in the presence of a}} broadband and high power reactive jammer by exploiting the reaction time of the jammer. We develop a prototype of BitTrickle using the USRP platform running GNURadio. Our evaluation shows that when under powerful reactive jamming, BitTrickle still maintains communication, whereas other schemes such as 802. 11 DSSS fail completely. I...|$|R

50|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} heart disease in all cats. It is hereditary in the Maine Coon and American Shorthair, and likely the Persian. The disease causes thickening of the left heart chamber, which can in some instances lead to sudden death. It tends to affect males and mid to old-aged individuals. Reported incidence rate in Persians is 6.5%. Unlike PKD which can be detected even in very young cats, heart tests for HCM {{have to be done}} regularly in order <b>to</b> effective <b>track</b> and/or <b>remove</b> affected individuals and their offspring from the breeding pool.|$|R
30|$|Cleanup of {{the tracks}} and other {{critical}} areas was primarily carried out by JR staff members with additional staff brought in from Kagoshima, whilst contractors were used for secondary areas such as platforms. Tephra was usually blown or washed off the tracks—not collected. A carriage, developed from experiences with Sakurajima, was brought in which sprayed water onto the <b>tracks</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> tephra. However, in secondary cleanup areas tephra was collected by the contractors and transported to the regular tephra dump locations. Tephra entering carriages meant that more frequent cleaning was required but no damage was reported. Larger problems were possibly avoided due to services typically not operating in ashy conditions.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a flexible}} honing technology by describing the new prototype machine with its specificity.

This method of honing shows the effectiveness of specific motion <b>tracking</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> traces of inversions. Circular trajectories with large radii can be traveled quickly without consuming too much energy. The high cutting speed promotes the removal of material thus saving time.

Construction began in October 2015 with the removal of the three yard tracks at the station site. The inner part of the Framingham/Worcester Line was closed for a weekend in December 2015 to allow construction of a temporary shoo-fly track, which allows the mainline <b>track</b> <b>to</b> be <b>removed</b> during construction. The mainline tracks were put back in service during a similar weekend shutdown in April 2017, restoring double track through Allston {{for the first time since}} the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Improve {{passive sonar}} systems by fielding {{adaptive}} beamforming algorithms that are computationally efficient, that operate effectively during rapid array maneuvers, {{and are able}} <b>to</b> <b>track</b> and <b>remove</b> interference from fast-moving surface traffic. OBJECTIVES Study {{a new approach to}} partially adaptive sonar signal processing and:-Demonstrate its ability to solve matched field source localization problems. -Compare its performance in acoustic waveguides to eigenvalue-based designs. -Determine when and why nested Wiener filters outperform eigenvalue-based designs. APPROACH This project is motivated by the signal processing needs of current and future Navy sonar arrays comprised of dozens or hundreds of sensors. Fully adaptive beamformers for such large arrays are impractical: they are too computationally demanding, and data adaptive implementations require too many independent, stationary samples. “Partially adaptive ” or “reduced complexity ” adaptive beamformers can be used to contend with these difficulties [4]-[7]. It is well known that decreasing adaptive degrees of freedom reduces data requirements, speeds adaptation in dynamic environments, and reduces computational overhead. The best-known design techniques are based upon principal components analysis of estimated covariance matrices. However, they are computationally costly because of the eigenvalue decomposition, an...|$|R
40|$|Serial Concatenation of Two Dimensional Soft Output Viterbi Algorithm (2 D-SOVA) {{and regular}} Viterbi Algorithm (VA) for 2 D {{equalisation}} and detection of Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) media provides excellent performance {{as compared to}} the use of 1 Dimensional (1 D) maximum likelihood detector. In this paper, we implement and evaluate the performances of two versions of it. The first version performs 2 D SOVA along the <b>tracks</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and then the Viterbi detector across the <b>tracks</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> inter-track interference (ITI). The second version carries out 2 D-SOVA across the tracks and VA along the tracks. The results for high ITI and ISI show a better performance when using 2 D-SOVA across the track with a small difference in computational complexity in favour of 2 D-SOVA across the tracks...|$|R

40|$|Wide area aerial {{surveillance}} data has recently proliferated {{and increased the}} demand for multi-object tracking algorithms. However, the limited appearance information on every target creates much ambiguity in tracking and increases the difficulty of removing false target detections. In this work we propose to learn motion patterns in wide area scenes {{and take advantage of}} this additional information in <b>tracking</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> false alarm and reduce tracking error. We extend an existing multi-object tracker for wide area imagery by incorporating the motion pattern data as further probabilistic evidence. Scalability is ensured by dividing the imagery into tiles, processing each tile in parallel, and handing off tracks between tiles when necessary. Evaluation on sequences from a real wide area imagery dataset shows this approach outperforms a competing tracker not making use of such data. 1...|$|R
50|$|Allon {{meets with}} Rabbi Zolli in Venice and {{encounters}} his daughter Chiara Zolli {{for the first}} time. Zolli explains that to his knowledge no Jews were harboured in the Brenzone abbey. In fact, evidence seems to suggest the opposite: that the church expedited the removal of Jews and later helped Nazi leaders escape judgement. Allon then travels to Vienna to inform his colleague Eli Lavon of his findings. Eli reveals that the Martin Luther in question was the Nazi director of the German Foreign Office, which collaborated with European governments <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down and <b>remove</b> Jews. According to Eli, the Nazis especially wished to maintain positive relations with the Vatican, for any denunciation of the Holocaust by a pope would have certainly made the Nazis’ work more difficult. Allon and Eli conclude {{that there must be}} some connection between Nazi leader Martin Luther and the Convent of the Sacred Heart.|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} 2007 local election, the Labour Party {{proposed}} that the line be demolished. The same year, the National Rail Administration stated that, after the Horten Line, the Namsos Line was the most likely line <b>to</b> have the <b>tracks</b> <b>removed.</b> In 2008, Namsos was considered as a port for shipping out minerals from Namsskogan. This would require a major overhaul of the line, if the mining company were to choose Namsos instead of Mosjøen. The upgrade would have cost between NOK150 and 250 million and taken one year. A decision to reopen the line for permanent operation {{would have to be}} taken by Parliament. The initial need for transport was 200,000 tonnes per year. In June 2009, the National Rail Administration stated that they would not continue to work on plans to re-open the line, as it was considerably cheaper to use the Nordland Line to Mosjøen than to cover the costs to reopen the Namsos Line. However, the mining company, Heli Utvikling, stated that should they increase their production to the planned 1.5 million tonnes per year, they would again consider Namsos.|$|R
