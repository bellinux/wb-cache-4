While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the <b>toning</b> is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling.

50|$|The <b>tone</b> {{contours}} of the Sichuanese dialects are highly and quite {{different from those of}} Beijing Mandarin. In Sichuanese, the first <b>tone</b> (dark level <b>tone)</b> is a high level <b>tone</b> (like Beijing), the second <b>tone</b> (light level <b>tone)</b> is a low falling <b>tone</b> (the mirror image of Beijing), the third <b>tone</b> (rising <b>tone)</b> is a high falling <b>tone</b> and the fourth <b>tone</b> (departing <b>tone)</b> is a low or mid rising <b>tone</b> (interchanged compared to Beijing) and the fifth <b>tone</b> (entering <b>tone)</b> is mid or high if it's not merged, as shown in the chart below.|$|R
5000|$|Consider the {{intervals}} {{of the major}} scale: <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone. Starting the scale on a different degree will always create a new mode with individual interval layouts—for example starting on the second degree of a major scale gives the [...] "Dorian mode"—tone, semitone, <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone.</b> This is not so of the modes of limited transposition, which can be modally shifted {{only a limited number}} of times. For example, mode 1, the whole <b>tone</b> scale, contains {{the intervals}} <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>tone.</b> Starting on any degree of the mode gives the same sequence of intervals, and therefore the whole <b>tone</b> scale has only 1 mode. Messiaen's mode 2, or the diminished scale, consists of semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> semitone, <b>tone,</b> which can be arranged only 2 ways, starting with either a <b>tone</b> or a semitone. Therefore mode 2 has two modes.|$|R
5|$|During 1794, Southey {{began to}} plan with Coleridge and others about a {{political}} system that they would start in America called Pantisocracy. He needed to get money for the project and he contacted Richard Cruttwell on 19 July 1794 to publish Joan of Arc for that end. After notifying Bedford about the plan, Bedford advised Southey to contact William Nicol, a London publisher, to publish the work and raise more money. Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of Joan of Arc was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50subscribers {{to pay for the}} cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798. Later editions were published in 1806, 1812, and 1837, with the final one further <b>toning</b> down Southey's republican sentiment.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia <b>toning.</b> The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E

After graduation, he moved to Paris, France, to work at Maison Walery as a photograph technician, but he sculpted in his free time. In the early 1870s, he decided to start his own photography and sculpting business on the Champs-Élysées. During this period, he married Etta Greer, an American woman who spent much of her girlhood in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Pee-wee Herman is a comic fictional {{character}} {{created and}} portrayed by American comedian Paul Reubens. He {{is best known}} for his two television series and film series during the 1980s. The childlike Pee-wee Herman character developed as a stage act that quickly led to an HBO special in 1981. As the stage performance gained further popularity, Reubens took the character to motion picture with Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985, <b>toning</b> down the adult innuendo for the appeal of children. This paved the way for Pee-wee's Playhouse, an Emmy Award-winning children's series that ran on CBS from 1986 to 1991. Another film, Big Top Pee-wee, was released in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as <b>toning,</b> strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.|$|E
25|$|In Season 18, John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} series' producer. He instituted {{a number of}} changes to the show, {{including}} <b>toning</b> down the humour and introducing more science fiction concepts. During this season the Fourth Doctor became very much subdued and, on occasion, melancholy. Baker began the season in poor health, though he eventually recovered. Both the actor and the character seemed noticeably older and tired, due to Baker's gaunt appearance and greying hair. Baker had been finding the role {{harder and harder to}} maintain and the previous season had been particularly draining on him. Many of this season's stories also had an elegiac tone, with entropy and decay being a recurring theme.|$|E

Original music was composed by Robbi Finkel, and character designs were overseen by Teiichi Takiguchi. The show {{was aimed at}} children by <b>toning</b> down the comics' darker themes.

The PCR underground's leaders were often Cocea's guests at Frascatti. His modernist supporters did not follow his lead. By 1929, Vinea and Contimporanul were <b>toning</b> down their own socialist agenda, cooperating instead with the moderate National Peasants' Party, and even drawing suspicion from the left that they had become sympathetic to fascism. Generally a critic of the National Peasantists, Cocea quit a resurfacing Facla in 1930, leaving Vinea in charge (the latter was editor of that newspaper until its 1940 disestablishment).|$|E
