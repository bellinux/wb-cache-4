5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. <b>The</b> <b>coordination</b> chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. <b>The</b> <b>coordination</b> chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{importance}} of <b>coordination,</b> captured by β, affects {{the height of}} the benefits from perfect coordination compared to imperfect <b>coordination.</b> When <b>the</b> principal’s <b>coordination</b> is important for the company, i.e., β is high, the benefits from perfect coordination are also high. The incentive costs for inducing the agents to provide high productive effort and with participative budgets to also report truthfully are also affected by <b>the</b> {{importance of}} <b>coordination.</b> For an increase in <b>the</b> importance of <b>coordination,</b> <b>the</b> negative impact on the agents’ expected compensation through not supplying high productive effort and misreporting is rising. In particular, the probability to obtain the high compensation payment in the case of high earnings declines. Thus, the principal can reduce the level of compensation payments needed to incentivize the agents. In sum, an increase in <b>the</b> importance of <b>coordination</b> affects both main economic forces at work in this setting, i.e., the incentive costs and the benefits from perfect <b>coordination.</b> <b>The</b> incentive costs are decreasing, whereas the benefits from perfect coordination are increasing in <b>the</b> importance of <b>coordination.</b> As a consequence, the principal’s expected utility under the top-down budgeting process is decreasing as imperfect coordination becomes more harmful.
