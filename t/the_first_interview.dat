5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> was videotaped, at the {{beginning}} of the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Lyons' admissions during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> {{were not}} very detailed, {{and many of the}} details {{provided}} did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had been killed, and he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the Tanzania People's Defence Force and counterattacked, {{joined by}} several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite {{military}} help from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Amin {{was forced to}} flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when Kampala was captured. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying out of politics. Amin lived {{for a number of}} years on the top two floors of the Novotel Hotel on Palestine Road in Jeddah. Brian Barron, who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman Mohamed Amin (no relation) of Visnews in Nairobi, located Amin in 1980, and secured <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> with him since his deposition.|$|E

The Dolphins denied the report later that day, saying it was an initial interview only and that the team had interviews with others planned over the next few days. However, the addition of quarterbacks coach David Lee, a former Cowboys assistant, fueled speculation that Sparano was indeed going to the next head coach of the Miami Dolphins.|$|E

500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs.

Watts arrived wearing jeans for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview,</b> direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> {{subject was}} a gay man, Lars Larson, who {{appeared}} undisguised and who spoke positively about his sexuality. Following his interview, Wallace gave {{the results of}} a CBS News poll that found that Americans considered homosexuality more harmful to the United States than adultery, abortion or prostitution, that two-thirds of Americans described their reaction to homosexuality as [...] "disgust, discomfort or fear" [...] and that one in ten described their reaction as [...] "hatred".

500|$|Lars Larson, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> subject, was infuriated {{after seeing}} the {{finished}} program. He had {{been led to believe}} that the episode would present a far more positive picture of American gay life. Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I had no problem with Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} human race and were out to kill as best they could." [...] Jack Nichols was fired from his job as a hotel sales manager the day after the program aired.|$|E
500|$|Also that month, Cosmopolitan {{published}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>interview</b> with Manning in prison, {{conducted by}} mail.

[...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response.
