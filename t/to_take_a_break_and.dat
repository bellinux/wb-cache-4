25|$|Marching bands {{serve as}} {{entertainment}} during American football games, {{may also be}} known as pep band. For college and high school marching bands, this is {{the primary purpose of}} the ensemble. The home team's band plays the national anthem before kickoff (often as part of a pre-game show), as well as other music while in the stands during the game. Bands cheer with the cheerleaders, and some bands create their own cheers. Marching bands then perform a show during halftime. When both teams' bands are present, it is common protocol for the visiting band to perform first. After halftime, some high school bands use the third quarter of the game <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> get food. College bands and some high school bands do not have such breaks, but continue playing in the stands during the entirety of the game. The band often stay the entire game, playing the school's fight song and alma mater at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.|$|E

500|$|Although Usher [...] "didn't {{look too}} far" [...] when {{starting}} {{working on his}} fourth studio album Confessions and decided to [...] "continue building" [...] with previous producers, he branched out with several musical collaborators. Usher enlisted Philadelphia producers Andre [...] "Dre" [...] Harris and Vidal Davis of Dre & Vidal, along with other musical collaborators. During the sessions, Usher asked them to create a [...] "real up-tempo beat". When they worked on the track, they partied the whole time which Dre considered a [...] "partly record". He recalled, [...] "We had some women, some drinks, some music." [...] After Dre created the beat, they decided to [...] "make sure the mood was inspiring during recording." [...] They went to club <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> played the song in Usher's truck while on the way.

500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good for me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that.” Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately I decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> I’ve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to give a little wink toward the things that I’ve been doing, so that’s why I’m a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] of what she was doing right then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the hood of a car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E

In 1998 their single [...] "Männer sind Schweine" [...] ("Men are pigs") became their first number 1 single in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with the album 13 also being number 1 in Germany and Switzerland. After a lot of promotion and touring that year, they decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> also to never again play [...] "Männer sind Schweine" [...] during concerts, due in part to its huge chart success, which in turn attracted remakes, e.g. [...] "Frauen sind Schweine" [...] ("Women are pigs").|$|E

2500|$|Benny {{even had}} a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous {{basement}} vault alarm, allegedly installed by Spike Jones, ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts, before ending invariably {{with the sound of}} a foghorn. The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, [...] "By the way, Mr. Benny...what's it like on the outside?" [...] Benny responded, [...] "...winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling." [...] Ed responded, [...] "Hey, that must be exciting," [...] to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), [...] "Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now." [...] In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> come back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was [...] "a red and yellow dragon".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon The Mouse that Jack Built and an episode of The Lucy Show.|$|E
