40|$|The General Influence Coefficient Algorithm (GICA), {{developed}} in this article, {{is a new}} calculation method for Influence Coefficients (ICs) with a general formula. Compared to the traditional calculation method, GICA can solve the ICs' calculation task when the group of trial weights are installed on the rotor each time, the trial weights are retained on the rotor systems, or there is redundant <b>trial</b> <b>balancing</b> data, when even part of the ICs is known. GICA is also {{a powerful tool for}} refining the ICs from redundant balancing data or historical balancing data and serves as a general algorithm. With the general matrix formula, GICA is ready to be applied in a computer-aided balancing system as the key part of calculation software. Examples in industry are also presented to demonstrate the aplication of this new algorithm...|$|R

Moore took {{a keen interest in}} Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending Cornell Medical School, where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to New York City following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer Mary McCarthy stated, [...] "Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [...] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop." [...] Moore helped Bishop first publish some of her poems in an anthology called <b>Trial</b> <b>Balances</b> in which established poets introduced the work of unknown, younger poets.|$|R

Pharmaceutical and medical technology industries {{play an important role}} in developing and testing new interventions that have commercial potential. However, many interventions for the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of stroke are either not drugs or devices or have no commercial potential. Like many other clinicians who are uncertain about the value of existing or new treatments, we are involved in investigator-led clinical trials to resolve treatment uncertainties. There is common agreement that investigator-led clinical trials are facing increasing difficulties and that as a result clinicians may be deterred from pursuing clinical trials as a research career.

40|$|Most solid tumors {{express the}} cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) protein, {{a target of}} NSAIDs. COX- 2 {{overexpression}} in tumorsis considered a predictor of more advanced stage disease and of worse prognosis {{in a number of}} studies investigating solid malignancies. Therefore, NSAIDs are evaluated as anti-cancer drugs. NSAIDs inhibit proliferation, invasiveness of tumors, and angiogenesis and overcome apoptosis resistance in a COX- 2 dependent and independent manner. This review will focus on the rationale behind NSAIDs, including selective COX- 2 inhibitors, in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or novel molecular targeted drugs. Studies investigating anti-cancer effects of NSAIDs on cell lines and xenograft models have shown modulation of the Akt, NF-kappa B, tyrosine kinase and the death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathways. COX- 2 expression in tumors is not yet used as biomarker in the clinic. Despite the increased risk on cardiovascular toxicity induced by selective COX- 2 inhibitors, several ongoing clinical trials are still investigating the therapeutic benefits of NSAIDs in oncology. The anti-tumor effects in these <b>trials</b> <b>balanced</b> with the side effects data will define the precise role of selective COX- 2 inhibitors in the treatment of cancer patients.

50|$|An {{error of}} {{omission}} {{is when a}} transaction is completely omitted from the accounting records.

40|$|QuestionHow has balance {{challenge}} intensity {{been reported}} in <b>trials</b> of <b>balance</b> exercise interventions? Are there any instruments designed to measure the intensity of balance challenge in balance training exercises?DesignSystematic review of randomised <b>trials</b> of <b>balance</b> training exercises. ParticipantsOlder adults, ie, the majority of subjects were aged over 55 years. InterventionBalance exercise intervention, or multi-dimensional intervention that included a balance exercise intervention. Outcome measuresThe included trials were examined for descriptions and instruments used to report {{the intensity of the}} challenge to the patient's balance system provided by the balance exercise prescribed. The other included studies were examined for instruments that measure balance challenge intensity. ResultsIn most of the 148 randomised trials identified, measures of reported balance challenge ‘intensity’ were actually measures of some other aspect of the exercise, eg, aerobic intensity or a hierarchy of task difficulty without reference to the patient's ability. Three potential systems of measuring the balance challenge intensity were identified. Two were not described in any detail. One was defined in terms of the limits of the patient's postural stability, but this system appears not to have been validated. No adequate measures of balance challenge intensity were found among the other types of studies identified. ConclusionThe review highlights a serious gap in the methods used to prescribe, implement, and evaluate the effect of balance exercise programs. Comprehensive work in this area is required to develop a psychometrically sound measure of balance exercise intensity...|$|R
30|$|A recent large pragmatic <b>trial</b> {{suggested}} <b>balanced</b> crystalloid fluid {{administration in}} critically ill adults compared {{with use of}} 0.9 % saline could decrease incidence of a major adverse kidney event within 30  days [10] rather than mortality or other renal-related outcomes. Effects of chloride content of intravenous crystalloid solutions in critically ill patients were still controversial. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was to evaluate effects of balanced crystalloids compared to controls with 0.9 % saline on mortality and renal outcomes for critically ill adult patients, with which minor differences might be detected in patient outcomes with statistical power, providing the hint for clinical practice.|$|R
