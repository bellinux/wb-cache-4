5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two can be distinguished in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E

5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour.

5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} produce mostly, {{among the}} berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage {{and before the}} fuel disposal, most of it beta decays to californium-249. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long {{when compared to the}} other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.|$|E
5|$|Oslac (fl. 966–975) is {{regarded}} as the first ealdorman (or earl) of York and its dependent territories. These included but may not have been limited to the southern half of Northumbria.

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways of doing this: a {{two-stage}} process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a direct {{process in which the}} extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> become the most common route, though the former is still significant.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{variation}} in colour over its range, though occasional females are darker overall than average, with markings less prominent or absent. The double drummer is larger and darker overall than the northern double drummer (T.sessiliba); <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> a white band on the abdomen, while the former has black markings {{on the leading}} edge (costa) of the forewing extending past the basal cell.|$|E

On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{recognition}} {{of more than one}} species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of the}} northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>has</b> light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
