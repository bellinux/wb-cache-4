40|$|ABSTRACT: Nonwoven {{structures}} have a {{range of}} applications which include geotextiles, interlinings, carpet backing and as reinforcements in composites. In this study, the tensile behavior of nonwoven structures including needlepunched and <b>thermal</b> <b>bonded</b> has been predicted by modifying the micromechanical model based upon the geometrical and mechanical properties of the constituent fibers (Adanur, S. and Liao, T.

50|$|The use of {{adhesives}} {{offers many}} advantages over binding {{techniques such as}} sewing, mechanical fastening, <b>thermal</b> <b>bonding,</b> etc. These include the ability to bind different materials together, to distribute stress more efficiently across the joint, the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, an improvement in aesthetic design, and increased design flexibility. Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing. Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion. These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase.|$|E

5000|$|Staple {{nonwovens}} {{are made}} in 4 steps. Fibers are first spun, cut to a few centimeters length, and put into bales. The staple fibers are then blended, [...] "opened" [...] in a multistep process, dispersed on a conveyor belt, and spread in a uniform web by a wetlaid, airlaid, or carding/crosslapping process. Wetlaid operations typically use 0.25 to 0.75 in long fibers, but sometimes longer if the fiber is stiff or thick. Airlaid processing generally uses 0.5 to 4.0 in fibers. Carding operations typically use ~1.5" [...] long fibers. Rayon {{used to be a}} common fiber in nonwovens, now greatly replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene. Fiberglass is wetlaid into mats for use in roofing and shingles. Synthetic fiber blends are wetlaid along with cellulose for single-use fabrics. Staple nonwovens are bonded either thermally or by using resin. Bonding can be throughout the web by resin saturation or overall <b>thermal</b> <b>bonding</b> or in a distinct pattern via resin printing or thermal spot bonding.
