5|$|A {{spin-off}} series, , {{was produced}} exclusively for mobile phones and was broadcast first to Sprint customers in April 2006 on SprintTV's Fox station.

This was an exclusive deal made between Toyota Motor and News Corporation's Fox network, allowing Toyota to sponsor exclusive {{content of the}} show and to obtain advertising exclusivity.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>for</b> free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the major}} record {{companies}} dominate the American music industry, an independent music industry (indie music) does exist. Most indie record labels have limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim {{to be signed}} to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release {{some or all of}} their songs over <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>for</b> fans and others to download and listen. In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers, and nightclub DJs. The American Federation of Musicians is the largest American labor union for professional musicians. However, only 15% of the Federation's members have steady music employment.|$|E
