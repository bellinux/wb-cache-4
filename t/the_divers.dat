25|$|Risk {{is managed}} by {{training}} <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> {{in a range}} of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to <b>the</b> equipment <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> chooses to use and the environment in which <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> plans to dive. Further experience and development of skills by practice will increase <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> ability to dive safely. Specialty training is made available by <b>the</b> recreational <b>diver</b> training industry and diving clubs to increase the range of environments and venues <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> can enjoy at an acceptable level of risk.|$|R
25|$|When underwater, a diver often {{needs to}} be {{neutrally}} buoyant so that <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> neither sinks nor rises. A state of neutral buoyancy exists when the weight of water that <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> displaces equals <b>the</b> total weight of <b>the</b> <b>diver.</b> <b>The</b> <b>diver</b> uses a BC to maintain this state of neutral buoyancy by adjusting the BC's volume and therefore its buoyancy, in response to various effects which alter <b>the</b> <b>diver’s</b> overall volume or weight.|$|R
25|$|What {{to do in}} <b>the</b> event <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> loses {{contact with}} the line or the line tender does not get {{feedback}} from <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> in response to signals given to <b>the</b> <b>diver.</b>|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which <b>the</b> <b>divers,</b> or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> with an easy supply of food, it bit <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>divers</b> made careful {{maps of the}} {{material}} they recovered, but {{had no way of}} determining on the spot what was inside the metal conglomerates encrusted by marine growth.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{just enough}} air in <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> {{to make it}} {{positively}} buoyant. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> floats at <b>the</b> water's surface. As a result of Pascal's law, squeezing the airtight container increases {{the pressure of the}} air, part of which pressure is exerted against the water that constitutes one [...] "wall" [...] of the airtight container. This water in turn exerts additional pressure on the air bubble inside the diver; because the air inside <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is compressible but the water is an incompressible fluid, the air's volume is decreased but the water's volume does not expand, such that the pressure external to <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> a) forces <b>the</b> water already in <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> further inward and b) drives water from outside <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> into <b>the</b> <b>diver.</b> Once <b>the</b> air bubble becomes smaller and more water enters <b>the</b> <b>diver,</b> <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> displaces a weight of water that is less than its own weight, so it becomes negatively buoyant and sinks in accordance with Archimedes’ principle. When the pressure on the container is released, the air expands again, increasing the weight of water displaced and <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> again becomes positively buoyant and floats.|$|R
25|$|Under pressure, gases {{are highly}} {{compressible}} but liquids are almost incompressible. Air spaces in <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> body and gas held in flexible equipment contract as <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> descends and expand as <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> ascends.|$|R
50|$|A {{full-face}} diving mask {{is a type}} of diving {{mask that}} seals the whole of <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> face from <b>the</b> water and contains a mouthpiece or demand valve that provides <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> with breathing gas. The full face mask has several functions: it lets <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> see clearly underwater, it provides <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> face with some protection from cold and polluted water, it increases breathing security and provides a space for equipment that lets <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> communicate with <b>the</b> surface support team.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>divers</b> use surface {{supplied}} umbilical diving equipment, utilizing {{deep diving}} breathing gas, such as helium and oxygen mixtures, stored in large capacity, high pressure cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed {{to the control}} room, where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use. <b>The</b> <b>divers</b> are supplied from the bell through umbilicals.|$|E
5|$|The major diving {{accident}} and fatality research {{studies that have}} been conducted globally including work by <b>the</b> <b>Divers</b> Alert Network, the Diving Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with the diving cylinder.|$|E
5|$|Trapezes {{are often}} used with diving shots. When diving in tidal waters {{at the end of}} slack water, the trapeze may be {{released}} from the diving shot to drift in the current as <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> make their decompression stops.|$|E
5000|$|F - Final Check : Conduct a final {{check of}} <b>the</b> <b>diver.</b> Ensure that hoses are clipped to <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> neatly, {{and are in}} the correct configuration. Make sure <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> has fins and a mask, and any other {{accessories}} (cameras, reels, knife, compass, torch etc.) needed for the dive. Check that these are secured to <b>the</b> <b>diver,</b> or else placed in a spot {{where they can be}} handed down once <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is in <b>the</b> water. Correct anything else that needs doing.|$|R
50|$|In a two wire {{system the}} {{standard}} arrangement for diver communications {{is to have}} <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> side normally on, so that the surface team can hear anything from <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> at all times except when the surface is sending a message. In a four-wire system <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> side is always on, even when the surface operator is talking.This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is alive. In a four wire system <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> to surface channel can be on all the time.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is not {{carrying}} a bailout cylinder, and another <b>diver</b> is in <b>the</b> immediate vicinity, <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> may request gas from <b>the</b> other <b>diver</b> ...|$|R
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> to rest during the ascent. It also allows <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. <b>The</b> <b>divers</b> generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The diving {{regulator}} is {{a mechanism}} which reduces {{the pressure of}} the supply of breathing gas and provides it to <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> at approximately ambient pressure. The gas may be supplied on demand, when <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> inhales, or as a constant flow past <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> inside <b>the</b> helmet or mask, from which <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> uses what is necessary, while the remainder goes to waste.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is {{breathing}} comfortably but {{is injured}} or trapped, the recovery procedure should minimise {{the risk of}} further injury, but if <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> is unresponsive, or not breathing, the bellman will open <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> freeflow valve and if necessary provide pneumo or bailout gas, then transport <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> back to <b>the</b> bell, following the umbilicals to minimise the risk of them snagging.|$|R

5|$|It {{consists}} of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} tables for {{professional}} diving use is generally {{made by the}} organization employing <b>the</b> <b>divers.</b> For recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free {{to make use of}} any of the published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.

The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E
50|$|The bellman would recover an {{incapacitated}} <b>diver</b> to <b>the</b> bell. If <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> {{fails to}} respond to voice or umbilical pull signals the bellman will assume that <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> requires assistance. It {{may be possible to}} pull <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> back using <b>the</b> umbilical, but it may be necessary for the bellman to lock out to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>diver.</b> <b>The</b> supervisor will monitor the bellman during these maneuvers and provide advice as may be needed.|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> drowning or further injury to <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on <b>the</b> <b>diver,</b> and suspending <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> from <b>the</b> surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby <b>diver</b> attend <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> undergoing <b>the</b> treatment at all times.|$|R
2500|$|Diving suits made of {{compressible}} materials {{decrease in}} volume as <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> descends, and expand again as <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> ascends, causing buoyancy changes. Diving in different environments also necessitates adjustments {{in the amount}} of weight carried to achieve neutral buoyancy. [...] <b>The</b> <b>diver</b> can inject air into dry suits to counteract the compression effect and squeeze. Buoyancy compensators allow easy and fine adjustments in <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> overall volume and therefore buoyancy. For open circuit <b>divers,</b> changes in <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> average lung volume during a breathing cycle {{can be used to make}} fine adjustments of buoyancy.|$|R
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which <b>the</b> <b>divers,</b> or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by <b>the</b> <b>divers</b> decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water.

50|$|Both diver and bellman monitor <b>the</b> <b>diver's</b> {{umbilical}} for excess slack. If the bellman {{takes up}} slack but <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> still has slack, the umbilical may be fouled, and <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> will generally follow the umbilical {{back towards the}} bell to clear it.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} used for recreational diving is mostly open circuit scuba, though semi closed and fully automated electronic {{closed circuit rebreathers}} may {{be included in the}} scope of recreational diving.Risk is managed by training <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> in a range of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to <b>the</b> equipment <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> chooses to use and the environment in which <b>the</b> <b>diver</b> plans to dive.
