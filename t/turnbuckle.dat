5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the <b>turnbuckle</b> padding. Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels {{seized the opportunity to}} attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected <b>turnbuckle,</b> Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the <b>turnbuckle,</b> but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the <b>turnbuckle.</b> Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex.

50|$|<b>Turnbuckles</b> {{have been}} used in {{aircraft}} construction. Historically, biplanes might use <b>turnbuckles</b> to adjust the tension on structural wires bracing their wings. <b>Turnbuckles</b> are also widely used on flexible cables in flight control systems. In both cases they are secured with lockwire or specifically designed wire clips to prevent them from turning and losing tension due to vibration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turnbuckles</b> {{with various}} size are popularly used in construction. They combine {{strength}} and durability, yet are simple {{to set up}} and adjust. Very small <b>turnbuckles</b> (as light as 10 grams) might be used to support a fence in a garden. On the other hand, extremely large <b>turnbuckles</b> (as heavy as several thousand kilograms) are widely used as support high-rise buildings or in structures such as bridges.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turnbuckles</b> {{find common}} use to tension the ropes in {{professional}} wrestling rings and boxing rings, where {{they serve as}} the attachment between the ring ropes and ring posts. Rather than the usual bare metal, here the <b>turnbuckles</b> are covered with padding {{in order to protect}} participants and staff. <b>Turnbuckles</b> even play a part in professional wrestling where they are often dramatically used by participants as part of their offensive repertoire.|$|R

This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the <b>turnbuckle.</b> Orton took the padding off the <b>turnbuckle,</b> leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold.
