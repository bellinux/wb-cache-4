The first substantial novel by a Singaporean writer about the Eurasian community in Singapore, it was the best-selling local paperback at the Times bookshop for three consecutive weeks between 22 August and 5 September 1991, and remained in the top five until 11 December that year. The work won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Award for works in English the following year despite being up against books by established writers such as Gopal Baratham and Suchen Christine Lim. He wrote three more books, People of <b>the</b> <b>Pear</b> Tree (1993), Island in the Centre (1995) and A River of Roses (1998), on the same theme within a decade. The first two of these won National Book Development Council Highly Commended Awards in 1994 and 1996 respectively, while the last won the Dymocks Singapore Literature Prize (now known simply as the Singapore Literature Prize) in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Once Hamel {{had been}} {{successfully}} invested and most resistance had ceased in the village, a brief halt was called. During this time, small actions continued as a German machine-gun post north of <b>the</b> <b>Pear</b> Trench was silenced by a Lewis gun {{team and a}} group of Americans. The second phase of the attack resumed after a 10-minute pause, as the men of the 43rd Battalion began to clear the remaining German defenders from the village and the nearby quarry. The British tanks fired machine-guns and cannons that fired grape-shot in the confined spaces of the village. As the sun began to rise they were no longer inhibited by the darkness and came to dominate the situation, winkling out isolated pockets of resistance in the areas that had already been captured.|$|E
25|$|As in <b>the</b> <b>Pear</b> Trench sector, {{the tanks}} {{assigned}} {{to support the}} attack on Hamel had not arrived {{by the time the}} infantry reached the line of departure, which meant that they had to attack without armoured support. As the 43rd went in straight against the defences, some of the German defenders began withdrawing. As elements of the 43rd outflanked the German positions in the village through the edge of Notamel Wood, heavy fighting broke out in Hamel and one group of Australians, along with their attached American platoon, killed 15 Germans and captured another 40. Meanwhile, the 44th went in against the German trenches along the ridge line to the south. There, after the tanks finally arrived, they took large numbers of prisoners as they cleared out the trenches. Around Notamel Wood, resistance was initially heavy as the German positions were well-sited to provide interlocking fields of fire. The company of the 43rd {{on the edge of the}} wood was held up briefly by a machine-gun enfilading their line of advance before a tank crushed the position; further north, the 42nd Battalion, after briefly becoming confused, had been moved into position with precision drill, and as the combined weight of air support, artillery and armour was brought to bear the German resistance in the wood melted away.|$|E

500|$|On 4 July, Australian and American forces {{attacked}} Hamel. Assigned {{the task}} of attacking a German strong point designated the [...] "Pear Trench", the 15th, with an attached company of Americans, suffered the highest losses of any Australian battalion committed to the battle, losing nine officers and 231 other ranks out of the 636 men committed.

In the darkness the three tanks that had been assigned to support their attack temporarily became lost, and as a consequence, the 15th's initial attack went in without armoured support. Coming up against strong resistance from well-sited machine-gun posts, the advance was held up until they were overcome by Lewis gun teams and section-level fire and movement, which allowed the battalion to gain <b>the</b> <b>Pear</b> Trench.

Four replications were made. Values for the total phenol content of <b>the</b> <b>pears</b> ranged from 54. 3 to 120. 8 milligrams per 100 grams of fresh <b>pear</b> tissue. <b>The</b> leuco-anthocyanin content of <b>the</b> <b>pears</b> ranged from 6. 4 to 21. 0 milligrams per 100 grams of <b>pear</b> tissue and <b>the</b> flavanol content ranged from 11. 3 to 44. 8 milligrams per 100 grams of <b>pear</b> tissue. <b>The</b> pH of <b>the</b> <b>pears</b> ranged from 3. 70 to 4. 09.
