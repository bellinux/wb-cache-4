40|$|Abstract. Effective <b>tutorial</b> <b>systems</b> {{can help}} promote {{products}} by reducing barriers of learning new applications. With dynamic web applications becoming {{as complex as}} desktop programs, {{there is a growing}} need for online tutorial/help systems. For visually impaired users the key limitations of traditional help systems are 1) poor access to help content with assistive technology, and 2) frequent reliance on videos/images to identify parts of web applications and demonstrate functionality. In this paper, we present a new interaction model, targeted towards screen-reader users, that describes how to embed an interactive tutorial within a web application. The interaction model is demonstrated within a system called DTorial, a fully functional dynamic audiobased tutorial with embedded content. While remaining within the web application, users can rapidly access any tutorial content, injected inline near relevant application controls, allowing them to quickly apply what they just heard to the application itself, without ever losing their position or having to shift windows. The model and implementation are grounded in sighted user help-systems literature and an analysis of screen-reader and Web-Application interactions. Lessons learned from the incremental design and evaluations indicate that providing visually impaired users with dynamic, embedded, interactive audio-based <b>tutorial</b> <b>systems</b> can reduce the barriers to new Web-Applications...|$|R

Although these design standards do improve the quality of E-Learning systems, it is widely accepted that an optimal learning environment is one where the learner is guided by an intelligent personalized tutor, that adapts to the level of expertise of the learner, for example in tailoring explanations to the user's domain knowledge and selecting appropriate exercises. This is the area of Intelligent <b>Tutorial</b> <b>Systems</b> (ITS) and User Modelling (UM), so far a mainly academic discipline.

One crucial reason for the difficulty in pursuing this issue in a systematic manner when relying on formal inference systems lies in the discrepancy between machine-oriented reasoning and human adequate argumentation. The associated differences, however, do not manifest themselves so much in variations in format and syntax, but more substantially in the way how the underlying information is organized.
