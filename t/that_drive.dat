5|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, Ball State's first drive stalled, and it ultimately went three-and-out. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 {{yards on the}} punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed {{to capitalize on the}} good field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard drive that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards for a total of 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also on the drive, Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game. At the end of the quarter, the Red Wolves had just concluded a drive, that had crossed into Ball State's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5-yard line. On <b>that</b> <b>drive,</b> Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. The first play of <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the Tide was trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded the {{following}} kickoff, and its offense continued {{with the success}} it found in its final drive of the first half. As in <b>that</b> <b>drive,</b> C. J. Spiller was a key performer. Clemson's drive began at its 40-yard line, and it took just five plays for the Tigers to score a touchdown. Four of those plays, including the culminating one, came from Spiller, who covered 40 yards during them. Spiller's touchdown cut Georgia Tech's lead to 23–20. But as quickly as Clemson scored, Georgia Tech moved even more quickly. From its 30-yard line, the Yellow Jackets needed only three plays, the keystone coming on a 70-yard throw from Nesbitt to Thomas for a touchdown. With 5:10 remaining in the quarter, the Yellow Jackets restored the 10-point margin, 30–20.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level.

To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E

5|$|Kent State went three-and-out {{on their}} first drive of the second quarter. Northern Illinois' ensuing drive {{capitalized}} on their strong field position (their own 41-yard line) by executing a 6-play, 59-yard drive that culminated in a 14-yard pass from Jordan Lynch to Martel Moore that tied the game at 10. Kent State committed another miscue on their next drive, throwing an interception to Dechane Durante. Northern Illinois again capitalized, {{this time with a}} 12-play, 58-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard rush by Akeem Daniels. <b>That</b> <b>drive</b> would be the final scoring drive of the half, at which the score was Northern Illinois Huskies 17, Kent State Golden Flashes 10.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez was {{announced}} as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 {{game against the}} Buccaneers after {{it was revealed that}} Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion. Sanchez's opening drive was excellent, completing 100% of his passes and ending it with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to make the score 7-0. Sanchez continued to play well {{for the majority of the}} 1st half, and threw a second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points. However, after <b>that</b> <b>drive,</b> Sanchez started to crumble, throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter. Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, in a humiliating 45-17 blowout. His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also a recurring theme {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E

5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks {{to the inside of}} the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer on the inside of the pellet. Each target costs tens of thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E

5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On <b>that</b> <b>drive,</b> Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{victim of}} poor field position, Ball State {{executed}} only three plays, {{the last of}} which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. They got on the score board on <b>that</b> <b>drive</b> via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7–3 Ball State. On their ensuing drive, Ball State executed another extended drive, this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10–10.|$|E
