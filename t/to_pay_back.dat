5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with the money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain significant financial and personal support from Australian rugby union legend David Campese, which helped him to complete the year. Mark has since stated {{he has been able}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the money Campese gave him.|$|E

The company paid the fine without a fight, and according to Daniel Pasquil, a USDOL director, is now in [...] "full compliance".|$|R
5|$|Conservative-led Lincolnshire County Council {{provides}} {{the top tier}} of local government for Navenby, with responsibility for highways, sites of special interest and schools. It is based at the County Offices in Newland, Lincoln. Navenby has one representative on this council, Marianne Overton, who also represents Branston ward. Following the election of May 2010, Navenby is represented at government level by Stephen Phillips, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency. The former MP, the Right Honorable Douglas Hogg QC, stood down from the post before the election after having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the cost of cleaning his moat.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic {{noted that}} it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> taxes. In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury {{announced}} that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually, or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer).|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|After further investigation, it was {{revealed}} on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had {{tested positive for the}} banned steroid THG. Analysis of his backup sample also tested positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003, making Chambers the first person to test positive for the new drug. Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending. The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two-year ban from athletics, backdated to begin on 7 November 2003. He was also banned for life from the Olympics and stripped of the medals he had won since mid-2002, after admitting that he had taken THG from that date. Chambers' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased, costing teammates Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process. Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Vildanden {{announced}} {{it plans to}} operate routes to Trondheim Airport, VÃ¦rnes, but lacks financial maneuverability to commence operations. By October 2009, Vildanden owed Kontorbygg, the operator of Geiteryggen, NOK1.5 million in airport fees. Kontorbygg stated that if Vildanden did not pay, the airport would have to file for bankruptcy. Innovation Norway rejected to give Vildanden a loan for NOK3.5 million in December 2009. Kontorbygg stated that the operation of Geiteryggen had cost the municipality NOK50 million {{in the course of}} the five years Vildanden had been operating from it. In February 2010, the Municipality of Skien announced that it required Vildanden <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the NOK3.1 million, plus NOK200,000 in interest, that they borrowed in 2007. The loan was renewed in March, after Vildanden paid NOK385,000. From 16 August, Helitrans took over as the operator, using an ATR 42. From 6 September, the company started with flights to Trondheim. The company ceased operations after its last flight on 14 January 2011.|$|E

5|$|Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He {{was caught}} in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial {{proposal}} to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet {{for the sake of the}} Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back.</b> The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which cost only 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they had to walk between the trains and the lifts. Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 final was Vieira's last match as an Arsenal player; {{he joined}} Juventus in the close season for a {{combined}} total fee of â¬20million. Wenger's decision {{to sell his}} captain was made so the team could benefit from FÃ bregas, who broke into the first eleven during the season. In later years, Wenger deviated from his usual counter-attacking style, and imposed a fluent system, with less emphasis on physicality. The immediate seasons after Arsenal relocated to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 saw Wenger sell several experienced players, and integrate more young talent, {{as a means of}} fostering an identity with the club. Financing for the stadium however meant Arsenal prioritised its expenditure instead of the squad and trophies. Though Wenger managed to solidify the clubâs position in the Premier League's top four and secure the necessary funds <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> its debtors, the 2005 Cup win represented Arsenal's last silverware for nine years. In 2014, he led Arsenal to a record-equalling 11th FA Cup, and became the record equalling most successful manager in the competition's history a year later, as his side beat Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|The film, under Hancock's {{direction}} and Tristan's writing, had originally a different tone and premise than what {{would eventually be}} seen in the final film. The two had envisioned Amity as a sort of ghost-town when the film opened with several businesses shuttered and the island's overall economy in ruins due to the events seen in the first film. The new resort and condos built on the island by developer Len Peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving the island's economy a much needed boost. Tristan had borrowed a subplot from the original Jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of the first film, in which Amity officials were in debt to the Mafia. Both Mayor Vaughn and Len Peterson were anxious for the new island resort to be a success not only to revive Amity but <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> loans from the Mob that helped build it, thus leading to Vaughn's and Peterson's ignoring of Brody's warning. Tristan and Hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development that would make the overall story that much more believable.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
