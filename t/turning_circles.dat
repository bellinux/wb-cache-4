25|$|Various {{suggestions}} {{were again}} put forward {{as to the}} layout in the Market Place, all being greatly objected to by the stallholders. One was for a line {{in front of the}} Exchange and along South Parade; another was for two large <b>turning</b> <b>circles</b> similar to those that had just been constructed at the Pier Head in Liverpool. Although both these projects had a lot of support, they were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one track. Steering is accomplished by changing gears on one and not the other. This maintains power to both tracks while steering, produces {{a wide range of}} <b>turning</b> <b>circles,</b> and even allows one track to be reversed while the other moves forward, allowing the tank to turn in place. This may be combined with brakes to further control the steering radius.|$|E
25|$|Against the Spitfire V, the Fw 190 {{was found}} to be better in all respects with the {{exception}} of turning radius. At 2,000ft, the Fw 190 was 25 to 30mph faster; at 3,000ft it was 30 to 35mph faster. Its lowest speed advantage was 20mph faster at 15,000ft. At all altitudes it remained the faster fighter. The Fw 190 was also faster in the climb. If a Fw 190 was engaged by a Spitfire V, it could use its superior roll rate to enter a dive in the opposite direction. Its dive speed would enable it to clear the Spitfire. In defensive mode, the Spitfire could evade an attack if caught at low speed only by using its advantage in <b>turning</b> <b>circles.</b> If travelling at maximum speed when engaged, the Spitfire could gain speed in the dive, forcing a longer chase, and drawing the Fw 190 further away from its landing ground.|$|E

2500|$|The airport {{by design}} can {{accommodate}} {{up to two}} twin-engined passenger aircraft up {{to the size of}} the Airbus A319, Boeing 737, and the Boeing 757-200. Following a decision to build a shorter runway of 1,550 metres the planned use of Boeing 737-800 aircraft had been ruled out. Instead the airport was to be designed to receive Boeing 737-700 aircraft. However, on 17 July 2012, the St Helena Government and Basil Read agreed to a change to the runway design, which including widening the embankment over an additional [...] at the southern end, paving an additional [...] of the runway with concrete, providing larger <b>turning</b> <b>circles</b> at the runway ends, and increasing the size of the apron. [...] As a result of wind shear issues discovered during commissioning of the airport, and the resulting need to land with a tailwind, even further restrictions on the aircraft have been shown to be needed. [...] Airlink decided to use a Brazilian Embraer E190 which is more compatible than larger aircraft with tailwind landings. However it still cannot use the full seat and cargo capacity.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their ship}} trials, several changes were made. The four ships {{were given a}} {{retractable}} bow spar in 1938-1939, which changed their lengths, from 114m (374 ft) to [...] between perpendiculars, and 119m (390 ft) to [...] overall. All four ships were initially fitted with a staukeil, a short keel that had a shallow wedge shaped cross section, under their transoms, {{in order to improve}} their <b>turning</b> <b>circles.</b> These were removed in 1940-1942. Although they initially all had forecastle sheer strakes on each side, in 1938 this was changed to a narrow spray deflector on their undersides, between their forwardmost 12.7 cm gun, and their anchor hawse. During this time, their sterns were also changed, being raised by [...] and extended by [...] Between 1937 and 1938, Z2 Georg Thieles spray deflector was wider on its foreship, but after this it was the same as the other three ships of its class. The four ships had their original upper bridge with a half-round front face removed in 1938, which was replaced with a new bridge, which was vaguely pentagonal in shape. In mid-1941, Z4 Richard Beitzen was fitted with a FuMO 24/25 and a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel.|$|E

50|$|Many black cabs have {{a turning}} circle of only 25 ft. One {{reason for this}} is the {{configuration}} of the famed Savoy Hotel: The hotel entrance's small roundabout meant that vehicles needed the small turning circle in order to navigate it. That requirement became the legally required <b>turning</b> <b>circles</b> for all London cabs, while the custom of a passenger's sitting on the right, behind the driver, provided a reason for the right-hand traffic in Savoy Court, allowing hotel patrons to board and alight from the driver's side.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{different}} measurements can be quoted for a vehicle. A curb or curb-to-curb <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> {{will show}} the straight-line distance {{from one side of}} the circle to the other, through the center. The name [...] "curb-to-curb" [...] indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a u-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel. If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a u-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall. The name wall or wall-to-wall <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a u-turn without scraping the walls. One can find these two ways of measuring the <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> (in meters) of 12.1(C)/12.4(W).|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors such}} as: stern hull shape, length, draught, trim, {{propulsion}} system and external forces affecting the drift angle influence {{rate of turn}} and size of <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> of ships. This paper discusses <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> characteristics of U and V stern hull shape of Very Large Crude Oil Carrier (VLCC) ships. The ships have same principal dimension such as length, beam, and draught. The <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> characteristics of the VLCC ships are simulated at 35 degree of rudder angle. In the analysis, firstly, <b>turning</b> <b>circle</b> performance of U-type VLCC ship is simulated. In the simulation, initial ship speed is determined using given power and rpm. Hydrodynamic derivatives coefficients are determined by including effect of fullness of aft run. Using the obtained, speed and hydrodynamic coefficients, force and moment acting on hull, force and moment induced by propeller, force and moment induced by rudder are determined. Finally, ship trajectory, ratio of speed, yaw angle and drift angle are determined. Results of simulation results of the VLCC ship are compared with the experimental one as validation. Using the same method, V-type VLCC is simulated and the simulation results are compared with U-type VLCC ship.
