25|$|Smyth {{had ordered}} his sappers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> blow the bridge. In {{the early morning}} on 22 February, {{it became clear that}} it might fall within the hour. Smyth's choices were to destroy the bridge, {{stranding}} more than half of his own troops on the wrong side, or to let it stand and give the Japanese a clear march to Rangoon. He decided the bridge must be destroyed, and at 05:30 on 22 February, this was done.|$|E

500|$|In early July, the {{security}} situation in South Ossetia aggravated, when a South Ossetian separatist militia official was killed by explosions on 3 July and several hours later an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Dmitry Sanakoyev, {{the leader of the}} Georgian-backed Ossetian government, injured three policemen. On 7 July, four Georgian soldiers were captured by South Ossetian separatists. The next day, the Georgian president ordered police <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> liberate the soldiers. Four Russian Air Force jets flew over South Ossetia on 8 July. A scheduled visit of Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, to Georgia on the next day nearly coincided with the timing of the flight. Georgia recalled its ambassador to Russia after Russia admitted its planes had flown in Georgia's airspace to [...] "let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down". This {{was the first time in}} a decade that Russia had admitted to an overflight of Georgian territory.|$|E

2500|$|A {{severely}} burned body {{found inside}} Spengler's house {{is believed to}} be Spengler's 67-year-old sister Cheryl, with whom he was living. The shooting was suspected to have followed an argument between Spengler and Cheryl. A two-to-three-page typewritten letter written by Spengler was found at the scene. It reflected Spengler's intent to ambush first responders, but offered no motive for the shooting.

On their return, the regiment's tanks were sheeted down so that all markings were hidden and all ranks had to divest themselves of identifying badges to prevent knowledge of their deployment becoming known. All were then entrained for Liverpool, where they embarked on the troopship Duchess of York.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{made three}} more trips to Hazelton that summer {{and then he}} sent John up to the Nass River {{with a team of}} pack mules, while he, Billy and Henry took the barges back to Port Essington and took the Minnie up the coast to the Nass, where they met with John again.

2500|$|According to the Serov Instructions, the deportations were {{swift and}} {{efficient}} {{and came in}} the middle of the night. Deportees were given an hour or less <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave. They were allowed to take with them their belongings not exceeding 100kg in weight (money, food for a month, cooking appliances, clothing). The families would then be taken to the railway station. That was when they discovered that the men were to be separated from the women and children: [...] "In view of the fact that a large number of deportees must be arrested and distributed in special camps and that their families must proceed to special settlements in distant regions, it is essential that the operation of removal of both the members of the deportee's family and its head shall be carried out simultaneously, without notifying them of the separation confronting them... The convoy of the entire family to the station shall be effected in one vehicle and only at the station of departure shall the head of the family be placed separately from his family in a car specially intended for heads of families." ...|$|E

[...] In between there would be some extra songs performed by the entire band, or sometimes just specific sections would perform fun little tunes. [...] After the Blue Band's halftime show, the announcer would bring out the cheerleaders who would, along with the Blue Band, begin a short 10-minute pep rally.

40|$|Research {{clearly states}} that quality home {{literacy}} environments and overall literacy development are related; however, {{there is limited}} research exploring the effect on home literacy environments as a predictor for letter identification scores for preschool-aged children. Understanding this relationship will help care givers and early educators create quality literacy environments for young children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine if the home literacy environment for preschool-aged children is a predictor for letter identification scores. The current research examined parent/care giver responses <b>to</b> the <b>Get</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> Read Home Literacy Environment checklist and students’ scores on the curriculum-based measure for letter identification. This investigation examined parent/care giver responses <b>to</b> the <b>Get</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>to</b> Read Home Literacy Environment checklist and student scores on the curriculum-based letter identification measure. The participants included 83 preschool-aged children in an urban Southern Arizona school district. The students attended an inclusive school district preschool program; therefore, both students with and without disabilities were included in the sample. The findings of the study suggested a significant relationship between home literacy environment and letter identification scores for preschool-aged children...|$|R
