5|$|The {{earliest}} independent {{styles to}} emerge were Yoseikan Aikido, begun by Minoru Mochizuki in 1931, Yoshinkan Aikido, founded by Gozo Shioda in 1955, and Shodokan Aikido, founded by Kenji Tomiki in 1967. The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death {{and did not}} cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> aikido.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience; Uchikoshi {{suggested}} adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game's story. The inspiration for the story was {{the question of where}} inspiration comes from; while researching it, Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, which became the main theme {{of the game}}. The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura. The localization was handled by Aksys Games; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the original Japanese version, opting for natural-sounding English rather than following the original's exact wording.|$|E
5|$|Forge and the Spartans return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Fire and {{the crew}} follows Anders' signal to an uncharted planet in another star system. The planet's surface is infested by the {{parasitic}} Flood, who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter. The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner docking station and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat and also to destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, {{and use them to}} obliterate humanity.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU masterplan. URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E

5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E

Maridjan led ceremonies <b>to</b> appease <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano by presenting them with offerings of rice and flowers {{in and around the}} crater. One of his most important duties was the performance of the annual Labuhan sacrificial ceremony dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> Mount Merapi. A procession from the royal palace on Yogjakarta led by <b>the</b> guardian sacrifices <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volcano <b>spirits</b> a set <b>of</b> ritual offerings including textiles, perfume, incense, money and, every eight years, a horse saddle.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the reign of Alexander II, Pobedonostsev maintained, though keeping aloof from the Slavophiles, that Western {{institutions}} were radically bad in themselves and totally inapplicable to Russia since they had no roots in Russian history and culture and did not correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Russian people. In that period, he contributed several papers to Alexander Herzen's radical periodical Voices from Russia.|$|E
