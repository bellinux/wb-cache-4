5|$|The {{division}}'s {{drive to}} the Rhine River jumped off on 13 March 1945, and carried the division through Merzig from 17 March, to the Rhine by 21 March, and across the Rhine at Oppenheim on 25–26 March. The division was then reassigned to XII Corps. It {{took part in the}} house-to-house reduction of Hanau on 28 March, broke out of the Main River bridgehead, drove through Fulda on 1 April, and helped reduce Meiningen on 5 April. Moving southeast into Austria, the division assisted in the capture of Linz, 5 May. It had changed the direction of its advance, and was moving northeast into Czechoslovakia, across the Vlatava River, when the cease-fire order was received. One day later, the division overran the Gusen concentration camp in conjunction with the 11th Armored Division, liberating it from German forces. There, it discovered that the Germans had used forced labor <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> an elaborate tunnel system with underground aircraft production facilities. SS officers at the camp allegedly planned to demolish the tunnels with the prisoners inside, but the movement of the 26th Infantry and 11th Armored Divisions prevented this.|$|E
5|$|While Ferdinand {{kept the}} French occupied, Prussia {{had to contend}} with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which wanted <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> a piece of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: an entirely nightmarish scenario. By 1758, Frederick was {{increasingly}} concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder river in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian army of 35,000 men fought a Russian army of 43,000. Both sides suffered heavy casualties but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish army repulsed the Prussian army, but did not move on Berlin. By late summer, fighting had resulted in a draw. None of Prussia's enemies seemed willing to take the decisive steps to pursue Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have ended the war in October at Hochkirch, but he failed to follow up on his victory with a determined pursuit of Frederick's retreating army. This allowed Frederick time to recruit a new army over the winter.|$|E

No wretched monk who droned his life away in that gloomy place, before me, can have been more tired of it than I am. He could take for relief (and did take) <b>to</b> <b>carving</b> demons <b>out</b> of the stalls and seats and desks. What shall I do? Must I take <b>to</b> <b>carving</b> them <b>out</b> of my heart?’ ...|$|R

ActionScript and JScript are other well-known implementations of ECMAScript.|$|E
25|$|The legendary {{religious}} zeal of the Normans was {{exercised in}} religious wars {{long before the}} First Crusade carved out a Norman principality in Antioch.

In 1064, during the War of Barbastro, William of Montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty.|$|E
25|$|Lythronax {{is known}} from some large teeth. It has been stated that these resembled banana-shaped meat cleavers, {{although}} somewhat smaller. Its teeth are serrated, but also quite beefy.

50|$|Jamestown was {{established}} in 1823 as a county seat for Fentress County. It was incorporated as a city in 1837.

25|$|Initially, {{the colonists}} were {{governed by a}} {{president}} and seven-member council selected by the King. Leadership problems quickly erupted. Jamestown's first two leaders coped {{with varying degrees of}} success with sickness, assaults by Native Americans, poor food and water supplies, and class strife. Many colonists were ill-prepared <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> a new settlement on a frontier. When Captain John Smith became Virginia's third president, he proved the strong leader that the colony needed. Industry flourished and relations with Chief Powhatan's people improved.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Arabs and Berbers in al-Andalus {{had been}} tense {{in the years}} after the conquest. Berbers heavily outnumbered the Arabs in the province, had done the bulk of the fighting, and were {{assigned}} the harsher duties (e.g. garrisoning the more troubled areas). Although some Arab governors had cultivated their Berber lieutenants, others had grievously mistreated them. Mutinies by Berber soldiers were frequent; e.g., in 729, the Berber commander Munnus had revolted and managed <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> a rebel state in Cerdanya for a while.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} Norman mercenaries {{to serve as a}} Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s.

In the 1060s, Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. Roussel de Bailleul even tried <b>to</b> <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> an {{independent}} state in Asia Minor with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, {{the wood}} had {{a wide range}} of applications. They used it in {{everything}} from construction of houses and shaping canoes <b>to</b> <b>carving</b> <b>out</b> crude tools. Clothing such as blankets, toweling, and shoes came from Softened Cedar bark. They did not have the methods or level of technology that was present {{in other parts of the}} world but they knew enough and were able to make it through the harsher exposure to the elements of nature. They developed a way to safely store food by drying it. Once that process was done, they took a vacation over the winter months, without having to face a renewed struggle in the fall so as to maintain their relatively rich lifestyle.|$|R
