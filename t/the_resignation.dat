According to the CPN (M) Minister for Local Development, Dev Gurung, the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> was to [...] "accelerate the process of {{formation of a new}} government and {{bring an end to the}} current transitional period". However, some considered <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> to be a means of increasing pressure on Koirala. <b>The</b> <b>resignations</b> were not immediately submitted to Koirala by the CPN (M), and therefore were not made effective. Gurung said that he expected a coalition government to be formed by 18 June.|$|R
5|$|The {{proposal}} prevailed, and the Primera Junta {{became the}} Junta Grande by incorporating the new deputies. <b>The</b> <b>resignation</b> {{and death of}} Mariano Moreno did not reduce the conflicts between Morenists and Saavedrists.

5000|$|Davidson {{resigned}} from the NL staff in 1999 {{as part of a}} failed mass resignation during labor negotiations. Instead of furthering negotiations, <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> backfired when baseball officials accepted <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> and replaced <b>the</b> umpires with people who did not belong to the union. Reflecting on <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> several years later, Davidson criticized the move orchestrated by umpire union executive Richie Phillips, saying, [...] "I went from being cocky, to just being plain dumb, to realizing I'm lucky I have a job. What we did in 1999 was just asinine. We were victims of our own success. Phillips had always beaten baseball, but baseball had enough. They called our bluff. It was a huge wake-up call." ...|$|R

5|$|Grant {{historian}} Josiah Bunting III {{noted that}} Grant was never {{put on his}} guard when Secretary Belknap came to the White House in a disturbed manner or even asked why Belknap wanted to resign in the first place. Bunting argues that Grant should have pressed Belknap into {{an explanation for the}} abrupt resignation request. Grant's acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>resignation</b> indirectly allowed Belknap, after he was impeached by the House of Representatives for his actions, to escape conviction, since he was no longer a government official. Belknap was acquitted by the Senate, escaping with less than the two-thirds majority vote needed for conviction. Even though the Senate voted that it could put private citizens on trial, many senators were reluctant to convict Belknap since he was no longer Secretary of War. It has been suggested that Grant accepted <b>the</b> <b>resignation</b> in a Victorian impulse to protect the women involved.|$|E

The next day, Lord George Hamilton resigned, and the following day, 16 September, Balfour announced <b>the</b> <b>resignations</b> of Ritchie, Hamilton and Chamberlain. The Free Trade ministers were appalled that Chamberlain's letter of resignation had been kept secret, and the Duke of Devonshire, who had also resigned, rescinded his decision. But when Balfour explained his fiscal policy on 1 October, Devonshire re-submitted his <b>resignation.</b> <b>The</b> <b>resignations</b> of Chamberlain, Ritchie and Devonshire left the government gravely weakened.|$|R
