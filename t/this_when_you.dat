500|$|This {{episode is}} one of very few {{that focuses on the}} {{religious}} aspects of the Futurama universe. In most episodes, it is indicated that the Planet Express crew, along with most beings in the year 3000, are [...] "remarkably unreligious". [...] It introduces two of the religious figures of Futurama, The Robot Devil and Reverend Lionel Preacherbot, both of whom make appearances in later episodes. Preacherbot, who speaks in a manner typical of inner-city African-American pastor stereotypes, converts Bender to the religion Robotology. This leads to a series of events that are similar in many ways to the experiences of real world religious converts. Mark Pinsky states that the episode has a [...] "double-edged portrayal of religion" [...] as it portrays both an improvement in Bender's character but also some of the [...] "less pleasant characteristics of the newly pious". The Robot Devil is introduced after Bender's fall back into sin. Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons, that while explaining to Bender his claim on his soul, the Robot Devil uses logic similar to that used by many Southern Baptists: [...] "Bender tried to plead his case, without success. 'You agreed to <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> joined our religion,' the devil replies, in logic any Southern Baptist would recognize. 'You sin, you go to robot hell— for all eternity." [...] By the end of the episode, Bender has returned to his old ways and states that he will no longer try to be either too good or too bad, a parody and contradiction of the Book of Revelation statement that one should not be lukewarm in his faith.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000–01 season, United {{retained}} the league title {{for a third}} season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club's board and Ferguson. He told the club's television channel MUTV that {{he was prepared to}} sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: [...] "The decision has been taken. I'm going to leave the club. I'm disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn't happened as I thought it would and that's all there is to it." [...] Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: [...] "I am delighted we've settled <b>this.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have been at the club as long as I have it gets in your blood." [...] Ferguson's decision to retire came about because he perceived his chances of winning a second European Cup as [...] "imponderable." [...] Age was another factor: reaching 60 acted as a [...] "psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baron, who {{describes}} bottling as a [...] "traumatic time for wine", has said, [...] "To me, wine {{has always been}} more than something to drink. My family’s love and appreciation of good food, the time I’ve spent in France and the many mentors I've had along the way have led me to {{an appreciation of the}} role wine plays in daily life as well as history and culture. To me, creating wine is one of the ways people preserve civilization." [...] Baron has also said, [...] "Even after years of experience, every vintage feels like a childbirth-if we remembered how much it hurt, we might never do it again. And wines are much like our children. Their personality is there from day one, and we can track it through, know its essence even if its behavior at any particular moment is off. You get a feel from all of this of where the fruit has been and where it’s going. You have to remember <b>this</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think about judging wines. They're alive and changing moment to moment; they have good days and bad; they show well in a particular glass or with particular food. Judging a wine at any particular moment in its life is like giving a kid a letter grade based on his behavior in the supermarket." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} films of the era, on B's and beyond, was Paramount's Psycho. Its $8.5 million in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960. Its mainstream distribution without the Production Code seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director Alfred Hitchcock was made, [...] "significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [...] greatest initial impact... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director William Castle), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than Psycho." [...] Castle's first film in the Psycho vein was Homicidal (1961), an early step {{in the development of the}} slasher subgenre that would flourish in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It seemed the less money available for a horror film, the better the chances of being grossed out by it: Blood Feast (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker Herschell Gordon Lewis, established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or splatter film. Lewis's business partner David F. Friedman drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers ("You May Need <b>This</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> See Blood Feast")—the sort of gimmick Castle had become renowned for in the 1950s—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it. Lewis and Friedman's efforts typify the emerging sense of [...] "exploitation": the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole.|$|E
