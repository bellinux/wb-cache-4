Work activities resulting in operator {{exposure to}} whole-body vibration have a common onset in off-road work such as farming.

Nevertheless, fatal accidents caused by machine loss of stability are still of great concern. In fact, despite ROPS have reduced injury to agricultural operators, tractor stability is still a complex issue due to its high versatility in use, especially considering normal operations in field, when interactions with the environment such as soil morphology and climatic conditions are involved, as well as interactions with operator skills and experience.

Because of their versatility and wide use many studies on safety are concerned with the stability of tractors, but they often prefer controlled tests or laboratory tests. The evaluation of tractors working in field, instead, is a very complex issue because the rollover could be influenced by the interaction among operator, tractor and environment. Recent studies are oriented towards the evaluation of the actual working conditions developing prototypes for driver assistance and data acquisition. Currently these devices are produced and sold by manufacturers.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{experimental research}} {{evaluation of the}} vibration exposure for the health risk prediction during vehicle operation. The vibration measurements were carried out on a recreational vehicle and two types of agricultural <b>tractors.</b> The vibration <b>levels</b> were measured for different surfaces and vehicle speed conditions. Based on {{the analysis of the}} results in the small agricultural tractor operated in the workplace (frameworks), Sed exceeded 0. 80 MPa by ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004, and Av exceeded 0. 89 m/s 2 by ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997. That means that operators driving small agricultural tractors more than 8 h a day have a high probability of adverse health effects. However, the exposure value for the recreational vehicle had Sed < 0. 5 MPa by ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 and Av < 0. 5 m/s 2 by ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 on highways and local roads. That means Recreational Vehicle operators driving more than 8 h a day, have a low probability of adverse health effects. Also, for the recreational vehicle, vibration was taken at different speeds (40 – 60 km/h, 80 km/h, 100 – 120 km/ h). However, the speed change did not appear to affect the vibration dose variation while driving a vehicle on the highway and road. Finally, the health effect index of ISO 2631 - 5 : 2004 are almost the same as assessment of health effect by ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{operators}} run a {{very high}} risk of exposure to mechanical vibration. To improve comfort, many different devices have recently been fitted to agricultural self-propelled machinery, especially on the most modern high-powered wheeled tractors. In contrast, agricultural tracklaying tractors are not equipped with a suspended cab floor and frequently poor or no seat suspension is fitted. Consequently, the levels of vibration measured in the driving seat of tracklaying tractors often widely exceed the limit stipulated by official national standards. The manufacturers of tracklaying tractors are currently trying to improve the level of comfort at the driver’s place by reducing both the production and the transmission of vibration. The vibration levels at the driving seat {{of a group of}} tracklaying tractors produced by some leading Italian manufacturers were so measured. The models examined in the study differed in having either 5 - or 6 -roller track support, different types and stiffness of seat suspension, and in {{whether or not they were}} coupled to an implement. The type of seat suspension, and above all its correct adjustment, dramatically influenced the level of vibration, as did the increase in the number of track rollers. In contrast, whether or not the tractor was coupled to an implement at the rear 3 -point linkage did not make any significant change to the vibration comfort during transport. Also on the best modern trackalying <b>tractor</b> models, vibration <b>levels</b> frequently exceed stipulated limits, so that a further reduction is urgently required. Possible solutions that could be developed may involve the universal adoption of rubber tracks and/or the fitting of silent blocks on the cab floor and suspension devices on one or both axles...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of transition of mounted implements from operation to transport on longitudinal stability of a tractor that works on sloping land, a mathematical model was developed. In this model two operation modes for a mounted chisel plow were considered: penetration of the plow into the soil and depth reduction of it, {{and the effects of}} transferred forces and torques from the plow on longitudinal stability index of tractor were studied. Longitudinal stability index of tractor was defined as the ratio of the dynamic load of tractor front axle to the static load of it when <b>tractor</b> is on <b>level</b> ground. To test the model, different geometries and mass specifications of tractor MF 285 and chisel plow combination were used as the input parameters of the model. According to the results of this study, during plow penetration into the soil, internal forces of the connecting rods were zero and positive values were obtained for the internal force of the connecting rods during depth reduction of the plow; therefore, connecting rods acted only as pulling beams. Furthermore, when the plow depth was increased, the model predicted the increase of the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in X direction; however, the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in Z direction was almost not affected by the plow depth and height ratio variations. These results were expected and verified that the assumptions of the model have been rational. Moreover, longitudinal stability index of tractor during plow penetration was approximately constant. However at the moment of transition of the plow from operation to transport, this index was reduced abruptly. Therefore in situations that tractor works on steep slopes, plow transition from operation to transport should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Farm {{equipment}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important financial asset for many farmers. Tractors probably represent the single largest component of equipment asset value. As such, changes in tractor values can have a dramatic effect on a farmer's financial situation. Changes in equipment value {{can be attributed to}} depreciation and the value of output produced. The general objective {{of this study was to}} identify a specific set of variables explaining changes in equipment value and to determine the relative importance of these variables. The Box-Cox power transformation technique was employed in estimating the depreciation patterns. The method was applied to two different sources of used tractor prices [...] auction and advertised. Remaining value (RV), defined as the real market price in time t divided by real purchase price, was regressed against several independent variables. These independent variables were age, usage per year, condition, horsepower, manufacturer, regions of the U. S., auction types, and net farm income. A number of these variables were found to have some important impact on RV. Depreciation patterns were found to differ between manufacturers. Significant differences in remaining values (RV) were found to exist for different regions of the U. S. and different auction types. For both auction and advertised data, an increase in usage produces a noticeable decrease in RV. For auction data, however, the level of usage tends to have greater influence on RV when the tractor is newer. The results did not closely approximate any clear depreciation pattern. The depreciation patterns are accelerated relative to straight-line method and are a combination of the geometric and sum-of-the-year's digits functions. The RV model was used to examine optimal replacement ages for farm <b>tractors.</b> Annual usage <b>levels</b> had the most influence on the age at which tractors were replaced.

40|$|Most farming at {{subsistence}} level {{is located in}} rural areas {{where the majority of}} smallholder farmers have low productivity which results in high rate of food insecurity. The areas are characterised by animal traction and poor farming practises, and monoculture is mostly preferred. In light of this, this study analyzed the impact of animal power on agricultural productivity. Smallholder farmers in the lowlands of Mohale’s Hoek district of Lesotho were investigated by means of a case study methodology. The aim {{of the study was to}} inform agricultural policy about the level and key determinants of inefficiency in the smallholder farming system so as to contribute to policy designed to raise productivity of smallholder farmers. The sampling frame comprised farmers and extension workers in the lowlands of Mohale’s Hoek district. From this frame, 118 farmers and 4 extension workers were randomly selected from four villages, namely‘Mapotsane, Potsane, Tsoloane and Siloe. The four groups of farmers include; the farmers owning and using cattle for ploughing, farmers owning tractor and cattle and using them for ploughing, farmers owning tractor only and using it for ploughing, and farmers who owned neither cattle nor tractor and normally hire these when ploughing operations are to be done on the farm. The interviews of these farmers and extension workers were conducted by means of semi-structured questionnaire which consisted of both open and close ended questions. The study used the stochastic frontier production model for the production efficiencies and linear regression model for the impact of animal traction on agricultural productivity. Both procedures provided insights into the relative contributions of animal power and traditional systems to poverty alleviation and food security in the project areas. Descriptive statistics were employed for farming systems and challenges facing small scale farmers. Gross Margins analysis was conducted for the animal power and <b>tractor</b> power yield <b>levels</b> for maize crop to compare the two types of power. Some diagnostic tests to detect serial correlation and heteroskedasticity and t-tests were also performed. The significant variables include the area of sorghum ploughed, members of the household that assist with family labour, education, quantity of fertilizer applied, time taken by the farmers in farming, members who are formally employed, household size, area of land ploughed, old age, costs of tractor and animal, marital status, income, area of maize ploughed, area of sorghum ploughed, quantity of fertilizers applied, costs of seeds and fertilizers applied, maize and sorghum yield and amount sold and consumed. The study revealed that monoculture is mainly practised and many smallholder farmers used traditional technologies that fail to replace nutrients in the soil. Nonetheless family labour was not a problem. During the farming season, tractors were used as the main source of power for ploughing. Most farmers hired these for maize production as it is a staple food crop even where animal power is available. It was noted that the tractors were few and in most cases old and malfunctioning. The cost of using animals in farming obviouslyplayed a role in the production of both maize v and sorghum in the lowland areas of Mohale’s Hoek district. Smallholder farmers who owned both tractors and animals produced more but they were mainly affected by high costs of maintaining the aging tractors, generally purchased on the used-equipment market. The increased challenges resulted in lower productivity of the smallholder farmers, including: unhealthy animals, drought, marketing problems, late ploughing, poor soils, lack of extension services, low yields, low income, lack of information, lack of appropriate implements, lack of support services, nutrition inadequacy, inappropriate farming systems. The study recommended the adoption and promotion of low-cost mechanization in the lowlands of Mohale’s Hoek district so as to increase the production of the smallholder farmers. Increased productivity will in turn improve household food security...|$|R
