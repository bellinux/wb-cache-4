25|$|In {{comparison}} with the D.I, the pilot sat higher in his cockpit, to improve his view over the <b>top</b> <b>wing.</b> This required a dorsal turtleback fairing over the rear fuselage, to improve its lines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> was {{of larger}} span than the lower ones; {{the middle and}} top wings carried ailerons. Span {{decreased}} from 65ft 6 in to 58ft 6 in between the top and lower wings.|$|E
25|$|The bottom wing was rigged with 3° {{dihedral}} {{while the}} <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> lacked any dihedral; {{this meant that}} the gap between the wings was less at the tips than at the roots; this change had been made at the suggestion of Fred Sigrist, the Sopwith works manager, as a measure to simplify the aircraft's construction. The upper wing featured a central cutout section for the purpose of providing improved upwards visibility for the pilot.|$|E
25|$|Two-seat dual-control trainer aircraft, {{with reduced}} {{sweepback}} on <b>top</b> <b>wings</b> {{to compensate for}} movement in center of gravity caused by removal of military equipment.|$|R
50|$|Following the craze for the homebuilt tandem-wing Mignet Pou du Ciel (Flying Flea), a triplane variant, the American Flea, was {{produced}} in America around 1939. In this variant the <b>top</b> <b>wings</b> were fixed and the bottom wing acted as all-flying ailerons.|$|R
5000|$|At the Aircraft Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath, the Virginia {{prototype}} underwent type trials. One of {{the first}} modifications was to replace the original two-bladed propellers with four-bladed propellers. An unusual set of [...] "fighting top" [...] turrets {{were added to the}} <b>top</b> <b>wings,</b> but these were later deleted from production aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The {{result was}} a {{completely}} new design. A tractor monoplane became a pusher biplane with large balanced fore-elevators, similar in basic layout to the Wright Flyer, but with a fully covered fuselage. Ailerons were fitted to the <b>top</b> <b>wing,</b> and twin balanced rudders were mounted behind the propeller, but out of its immediate slipstream. The only obvious component of the Bleriot that {{found its way into}} the new design was its 60hp (45kW) E.N.V. Type F engine.|$|E
25|$|As with {{conventional}} biplane floatplanes, the torpedo was carried between {{the bottom of}} the fuselage and the floats. Unusually, the aircraft was flown from the rear cockpit, although this did cause a problem for an observer in the front seat. The observer had to stand on the coaming to use the machine-gun, which was level with the <b>top</b> <b>wing.</b> When a torpedo was carried, the aircraft could not fly with an observer at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{on top of}} {{the hull}} and were braced with four sets per side of Warren strut style interplane {{structures}} comprising 'V' struts, which obviated the need for drag inducing wire bracing. The wing structure was formed with built-up steel spars, four in the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> and three in the lower wing, and duralumin ribs riveted to the spars and braced internally. The fuselage was also made up from formed steel members built up into a framework which was then covered with fabric or dural sheeting.|$|E

25|$|The Avax XC5 {{employs a}} unit cell {{structure}} {{that uses a}} combination of two non-carrying ribs with double diagonal segmented ribs attached to the <b>wing's</b> <b>top</b> surface. The <b>wing</b> trailing edge employs mini-ribs to maintain a smooth profile.|$|R
25|$|The first tractor biplane used {{a wooden}} {{fuselage}} {{with a small}} seat on <b>top.</b> The <b>wings</b> were covered with a Goodyear rubberized cloth.|$|R
25|$|The French Nieuport 11 {{and later}} on, the Nieuport 17 and the British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft, the Lewis was mounted above the <b>top</b> <b>wing,</b> {{sometimes}} on a Foster mount, which allowed firing directly forward outside the propeller arc. The Foster mount usually incorporated an arc-shaped I-beam rail as its rearmost structural member, that a Lewis gun could be slid backwards and downwards along the rail towards the cockpit, {{to allow the}} ammunition drum to be changed in flight — but fighter ace Albert Ball V.C. also understood that the Lewis gun in such a mount also retained its original trigger, and could thus be fired upwards. He used the upward firing Lewis to attack solitary German two-seater aircraft from below and behind, where the observer could not see him or fire back. It was {{his use of the}} weapon in this way, in a Nieuport, that led to its later introduction on the S.E.5/S.E.5a. Ball had acted in a consultant capacity on the development of this aeroplane. The later Sopwith Dolphin, already armed with twin synchronized Vickers guns just forward of the pilot and just above its V-8 engine, could also use one or two Lewis guns mounted on the forward crossbar of its cabane structure, between the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> panels, as an anti-Zeppelin measure.|$|E
25|$|Boelcke had to swerve {{to avoid}} a mid-air {{collision}} in the dogfight and Böhme's Albatros briefly collided with that of Boelcke. The wheels of Böhme's plane barely brushed {{the fabric of the}} <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> of Boelcke's craft, enough to start the fabric unraveling. Boelcke struggled for control as his plane's control surface shredded in the turbulence. He skillfully crashlanded after the entire upper wing tore loose. However, in his haste to be airborne he had not fastened his seat belt. Boelcke was killed by his relatively mild impact. Böhme survived the accident, as he had suffered only a landing gear damage.|$|E
25|$|The T3M {{was a large}} single-engined biplane {{capable of}} being fitted with either a {{conventional}} tailwheel undercarriage or floats. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tube {{in place of the}} riveted steel frame of the CS/SC, with the pilot and bombardier seated {{side by side in the}} front cockpit situated forward of the wing, with the bombardier having a position under the nose for aiming the aircraft's bombs or torpedoes, while the gunner had a cockpit well aft of the wing, with a radiator slung under the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> between the cockpits. Power was from a 575hp (429kW) Wright T-3B V-12 engine. 24 T3M-1s were built.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, a <b>top</b> secret <b>wing</b> {{was added}} and secret {{printing}} jobs for various ministries and government offices {{were added to}} the work of the press.|$|R

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} dogfight, Boelcke and Böhme, unaware of each other's presence, {{closed in on}} the same aircraft, flown by Captain Arthur Knight. Von Richthofen dived in on the flight path of that very same aircraft; he was chasing the other DH.2, piloted by Lieutenant Alfred Edwin McKay. Boelcke swerved to avoid a {{collision}} with the interceding aircraft. Böhme's landing gear brushed Boelcke's upper wing. As the fabric peeled off the upper wing of his aircraft, Boelcke struggled for control. He and his aircraft fell out of sight into a cloud. When it emerged, the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> was gone. However, Boelcke made a relatively soft crash-landing. The impact seemed survivable. However, his lap belt did not restrain him, and he never wore a helmet when he flew.|$|E
25|$|No. 24 Squadron {{was then}} re-equipped with the Airco DH.5. The DH.5 was unusual in design with the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> having a 'back stagger', behind the lower wing, {{to give the}} pilot good visibility, {{especially}} overhead. Given its lack of power (top speed was 102 miles per hour) and poor performance at higher altitudes, it was used more for ground attack than air combat. Nevertheless, it was while flying the DH.5 that Woollett destroyed three more German aircraft and drove another down 'out of control'. On 17 August 1917, he became an ace. He was posted back to England as a flight instructor at Eastbourne in August 1917. On 9 January 1918, {{he was awarded the}} Military Cross; a Bar in lieu of a second award would follow on 22 June.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{adopted a}} {{national}} insignia for all military aircraft in May 1917 using the colors specified for the U.S. flag, {{consisting of a}} white five-pointed star inside of a blue circumscribed circle, with a red circle {{in the center of}} the star having a diameter tangent to the pentagon of the interior points of the star. The insignia was ordered painted on both wingtips of the upper surface of the <b>top</b> <b>wing,</b> the lower surface of bottom wings, and the fuselage of all Army aircraft on 17 May 1917. However due to concerns about confusion with the markings of enemy aircraft, in early 1918 a red, blue, and white roundel similar to those used by the Allied Powers, in the former color arrangement of the defunct Imperial Russian Air Service, was instead ordered painted on all U.S. aircraft operating in Europe, remaining in effect until 1919.|$|E
5000|$|The Medina {{was built}} for the Air Council between 1925 and 1926 and was a plywood-covered wooden flying boat powered by two 450 hp Bristol Jupiter VI radial engines mounted onto and slung from the <b>top</b> <b>wings.</b> [...] It was an {{inverted}} sesquiplane, with the upper wing smaller than the lower wing, using Warren-type interplane struts. It had a crew of two and room for ten passengers. Only one Medina was built, registered G-EBMG, first flying in November 1926. It proved disappointing, having poor water handling, with its hull being prone to leaks. It was withdrawn from use and scrapped in 1929.|$|R

25|$|On 20 August 1929, off {{the coast}} of New Jersey, a biplane hooked itself to the bottom of a {{dirigible}} and was carried along by the larger craft. This is the 2nd such incident. The “snapon, snapoff” experiment is accomplished by the Navy airship , under Lt. Com. Herbert Wiley, and a Navy biplane. The biplane, regulating its speed to that of the dirigible, flew close under the Los Angeles. A large hook had been attached {{to the middle of the}} <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> of the biplane, and from the bottom of the Los Angeles hung a U-shaped yoke. Maneuvering the ship under the dirigible, the plane pilot slipped the hook into the Los Angeles’ yoke and for 3 or 4 minutes the dirigible carried the biplane. The plane pilot, by a cord arrangement in his cabin, withdrew the hook from the yoke and flew clear of the dirigible.|$|E
500|$|The {{evaluations}} proceeded successfully {{through the}} flight envelope without major changes required {{to the basic}} design. The only incident of note was a fire that {{broke out in the}} hangar where the PL.8-01 had been stored. Scorched fabric on the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> was the result with effective repairs carried out shortly after. On 7 May 1927, after the tests were complete, [...] the aircraft was prepared for its record flight, flying from Villacoublay to Le Bourget Field.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lower air}} {{pressure}} on the <b>top</b> of the <b>wing</b> generates a smaller downward force on the <b>top</b> of the <b>wing</b> than the upward force generated by the higher air {{pressure on the}} bottom of the wing. Hence, a net upward force acts on the wing. This force is called the [...] "lift" [...] generated by the wing.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Howard T. Wright {{and built}} by the {{aircraft}} department of the shipbuilder J. Samuel White & Company Ltd., the Wight Baby was a single-bay biplane with ailerons on the <b>top</b> <b>wings</b> only and a fabric-covered wooden fuselage. It was powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four-bladed propeller. Three prototypes were constructed (Nos. 9097, 9098 and 9099), and service trials were undertaken at the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe and also at the Isle of Grain, but the aircraft's performance was {{not good enough for}} any further development work or volume production to be carried out.|$|R
2500|$|S.35 Built for Maurice Egerton, with a nacelle. 50hp Gnome, ailerons on <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> only. Damaged in {{a landing}} {{accident}} on 13 January 1912 and probably rebuilt as a Triple Twin.|$|E
2500|$|The Nighthawk had six-bay swept quadraplane {{wings and}} a biplane {{tailplane}} with twin fins and rudders. The fuselage filled {{the gap between}} the second and third wings; the cockpit, which carried up to the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> [...] "turret", was enclosed and heated.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{modifications}} were subsequently {{made to the}} aircraft. In December 1911 the upper wings were extended and the fuel capacity was increased: the extensions were removed in February, and fitted to the Tandem Twin. In October both upper and lower wings were extended, giving it a wingspan of , and the <b>top</b> <b>wing</b> was later further extended, giving it an upper span of [...]|$|E

50|$|That year, FFA 68 {{was renamed}} Kampfeinsitzer Kommando Habsheim before {{becoming}} Jagdstaffel 15 on 28 September 1916. Udet would claim five more victims, before transferring to Jasta 37 in June 1917. In {{the first of}} his victories on 12 October 1916, Udet forced a French Breguet to land safely in German territory, then landed nearby to prevent its destruction by its crew. The bullet-punctured tires on Udet's Fokker flipped the plane forward onto its <b>top</b> <b>wings</b> and fuselage. Udet and the French pilot eventually shook hands next to the Frenchman's aircraft. In January 1917, Udet was commissioned as a Leutnant der Reserve (lieutenant of reserves). The same month, Jasta 15 re-equipped with the Albatros D.III, a new fighter with twin synchronized Maschinengewehr 08 machine guns.|$|R
