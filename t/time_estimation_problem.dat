40|$|The ready queue {{processing}} <b>time</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>problem</b> appears {{when many}} processes {{remain in the}} ready queue just before the occurrence of sudden failure of system. The system administrator has to decide immediately, how much further time is required to process the remaining jobs in the ready queue, before shutting down the entire system as precautionary measure, so that while restart, it may remain in the safe state. In lottery scheduling, this prediction is possible {{with the help of}} sampling techniques. Factor- Type estimation method, existing in literature of sampling, was used by many authors to predict the time required provided the highly correlated sources of auxiliary information are available. This paper suggests two new estimation methods to predict the remaining total processing time required to process completely the ready queue provided sources of auxiliary information are negatively correlated. Under this approximation, the bias and m. s. e of the proposed estimators have been obtained using the set up of random sampling applicable to lottery scheduling. Performance of both estimation methods are compared in terms of mean squared error. The confidence intervals are calculated for comparing the efficiency of the estimate.

40|$|Reliable {{and high}} {{accuracy}} (decimeter level) localization of a rover {{relative to a}} defined frame is an enabling technology for numerous Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications (e. g., automotive guidance, routing, lane departure warning). The goal of localization is to compute the navigation state of the rover in some defined frame of reference such that the expected errors in the estimate is within a given performance specification. Inertial navigation is a popular navigation technique since it provides full six Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) navigation information. Further inertial sensors have been studied for decades and have well understood error models. This dissertation discusses the theoretical and implementation aspects of certain sensor aided Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). Though the presentation can be easily generalized to all forms of INS, {{the primary focus of}} this dissertation will be on automotive INS. This dissertation formulates the localization problem in a mathematically rigorous fashion and poses it as a nonlinear Bayesian estimation problem. The INS kinematic equations and linearized error state equations required by the Bayesian estimation solution are derived. Aiding techniques like GPS, Vision and stationary aiding are described and mathematically formulated. Observability and performance analysis are presented for each of these aiding scenarios.

We discuss two cross-validation procedures that address different aspects of inference in divergence time estimation. 'Fossil cross-validation' is a procedure used to identify the impact of different individual calibrations on overall estimation.

'Fossil-based model cross-validation' is an entirely different procedure that uses fossils to identify the optimal model of molecular evolution in the context of rate smoothing or other inference methods. Both procedures were applied to two recent studies: an analysis of monocot angiosperms with eight fossil calibrations and an analysis of placental mammals with nine fossil calibrations. In each case, fossil calibrations could be ranked from most to least influential, and in one of the two studies, the fossils provided decisive evidence about the optimal molecular evolutionary model...|$|E
30|$|Timetable {{planning}} {{consists in}} establishing for each train line a feasible schedule of arrival and departure {{times at the}} stations served consecutively, consistent with the safety and signalling system, transfer connections and regulations. For this purpose, several factors {{have to be taken}} into account, such as train running times, blocking times and minimum headway between two successive convoys, dwell times at stations and possible buffer times. In particular, the paper focuses on the dwell <b>time</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>problem.</b> However, although mass transit agencies may adopt a statistical approach for determining dwell times as a function of confidence degrees (expressed, for instance, in terms of percentiles), the planning phase is implemented when the service is not yet in operation (for instance, {{in the case of a}} new line, new services or new timetables), and therefore, there are no available data for implementing such procedures. Hence, in these cases, it is necessary to adopt a modelling approach for simulating future and hypothetical conditions. Our proposal aims to provide an analytical tool for supporting planning phases. Moreover, since mass transit agencies may adopt some control strategies to increase the compliant between the real and the scheduled timetables, the use of a decision support system which allows to estimate actual dwell times may direct the use of proper intervention actions such as the adoption of additional rolling stock, the increase or reduction in stop duration of a convoy or the limitation of passengers flows on platform. In the literature, contributions on dwell times follow mainly two kinds of approaches, namely regression and micro-simulation methodologies. Methods based on the former approach aim to provide, on the basis of the data observed, a regression model which expresses dwell times as a sum of constant and variable predictors. In particular, fixed values are related to the unlocking, opening and closing times of doors together with any planned buffer times; indeed, they are invariant once rolling stock features and train dispatching times are set up. By contrast, variable parameters are a function of the users alighting and boarding times which, in turn, depend on passenger flows. Statistical techniques were the first kind of approach proposed in the literature [2, 3] and were borrowed from the bus service sector [4, 5, 6]. More recent contributions in this field are provided by [7, 8, 9, 10]. However, broadly speaking, these methods are not generic enough to be applied in contexts other than those in which they were developed, and moreover, they provide no details about passenger behavioural rules when a train arrives.|$|E

The algorithms studied here provide various tradeoffs between computational complexity, estimation precision and necessary sampling rate.

A two-step approach is proposed to obtain accurate time delay estimates of signals that occupy multiple dispersed bands simultaneously, with significantly lower computational complexity than the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. In {{the first step}} of the proposed approach, an ML estimator is used for each band of the signal in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the signal occupying that band. Then, in the second step, the estimates from the first step are combined in various ways in order to obtain the final time delay estimate. The combining techniques that are used in the second step are called optimal combining, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) combining, selection combining and equal combining. It is shown that the performance of the optimal combining technique gets very close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound at high SNRs.

A novel geometric formulation is proposed, together with a thorough algebraic analysis and a global optimization solver. The proposed model is thoroughly described and evaluated. The geometric analysis, stemming from the direct acoustic propagation model, leads to necessary and sufficient conditions {{for a set of}} time delays to correspond to a unique position in the source space. Such sets of time delays are referred to as feasible sets.

A subspace based algorithm for the time-delay <b>estimation</b> <b>problem</b> is proposed. The algorithm is a minor {{modified version of the}} MUSIC estimator proposed in [1, 2]. Through theoretical analysis and simulations it is shown that the sub-space approach to <b>time</b> delay <b>estimation</b> in a multirate DS-CDMA system is applicable when the algorithm is applied in a way such that the low-rank structure of the system is conserved...|$|R
