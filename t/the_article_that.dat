25|$|Johnson and Mostyn-Owen {{married in}} West Felton, Shropshire, in September 1987; a violin piece was {{specially}} commissioned {{for the wedding}} from Hans Werner Henze. The couple honeymooned in Egypt before settling into a flat in West Kensington, West London. There, Johnson secured work for a management consultancy company, L.E.K. Consulting; finding it incredibly boring, he resigned after a week. Through family connections, in late 1987 he began work as a graduate trainee at The Times, shadowing one of its journalists. Scandal erupted when Johnson wrote {{an article on the}} archaeological discovery of Edward II's palace for the newspaper. Johnson invented a quote for <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>that</b> he falsely claimed came from the historian Colin Lucas, his own godfather.

The captives were later exchanged or released, and in 2011 Ivleva found in Azerbaijan that woman. Her little child grew up, but did not speak because of the shock she suffered in her childhood.|$|E

The head of Iran-China economic room, Asadollah Asgaroladi said in <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>that</b> such transactions are easily possible. Based on the article Israel imports only a quarter of pistachios from US and about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of pistachio at all and the source is very likely to be from Iran. Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of pistachio from Iran. Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios from Iran. In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones wrote a letter to Israel's finance minister Ronnie Bar-on demanding Israel to stop importing Iranian pistachios from Turkey. Similar reports have been published by Haaretz.|$|E

500|$|In January 2010, Karen Geurtsen, a Dutch {{journalist}} {{from the}} magazine HP-De Tijd, revealed a painful breach of security.

500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>that</b> {{introduces}} the term throffer, Steiner considers {{the difference between}} interventions {{in the form of}} a threat and those {{in the form of a}}n offer.

Steiner observes that a concept of [...] "normalcy" [...] is presupposed in literature on coercion, as changes in well-being for the subject of an intervention are not merely relative, but absolute; any possibility of an absolute change requires a standard, and this standard is [...] "the description of the normal and preducable course of events, that is, the course of events which would confront the recipient of the intervention were the intervention not to occur".|$|E

500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>that</b> {{named the}} Martinique macaw, Rothschild also listed an [...] "Anodorhynchus coeruleus", {{supposedly}} from Jamaica. Salvadori also questioned this in 1906, {{as he was}} unsure what Rothschild was referring to. In his Extinct Birds, Rothschild clarified that his first description was erroneous, as he had misread an old description. He renamed it Ara erythrura, based on a 1658 description by Charles de Rochefort, and conceded that its provenance was unknown. This supposed species subsequently received common names such as [...] "red-tailed blue-and-yellow macaw" [...] and [...] "satin macaw" [...] in the ornithological literature. Greenway suggested Rochefort's description was dubious, as he had never visited Jamaica, and appeared to have based his account on one by Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre. If either bird ever existed, Ara erythrura {{is likely to have}} been identical to the Martinique macaw. Other similar blue and yellow macaws, such as the [...] "great macaw" [...] ("Psittacus maximus cyanocroceus") were also reported from Jamaica. Birdlife International does not have an entry for the Martinique macaw, but it was mentioned in that of the Lesser Antillean macaw (which is considered Not Recognized) as possibly identical.|$|E

In [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a [...] "distinguished schoolbook publisher" [...] {{to write a book}} for young children about [...] "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below". The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, [...] "you can't use the word scaling. You can't use the word peaks. You can't use Everest. You can't use 60. You can't use degrees. You can't..." [...] Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. In [...] "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the [...] "three excruciatingly painful weeks" [...] in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, [...] "queen" [...] was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter [...] "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter [...] "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus.
