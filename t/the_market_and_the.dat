5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E

30|$|The {{motivation}} of the approximate translation invariance {{is to take}} the relation between <b>the</b> scientific <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network into consideration. In rough approximation, <b>the</b> scientific <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network can be considered as relatively independent. Consequently, their contributions to φ(w) are additive. Summing (6), and (7), we obtain (8), i.e., approximate translation invariance. The Eq. 8 therefore expresses some kind of linear superposition of the effect of <b>the</b> scientific <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network. This superposition is not valid in the general case.|$|R
30|$|In the {{robustness}} test, the crisis period is defined using data and statistics {{instead of the}} pre-decided definition, which makes the estimation of Formula (2) more significant. In addition, the directions of the coefficients {{are consistent with the}} previous results. To be specific, in most of <b>the</b> developed <b>markets,</b> <b>the</b> flight to quality occurred between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond <b>markets.</b> However, in <b>the</b> emerging <b>markets,</b> there was little flight to quality evident between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond <b>markets.</b> In certain emerging Asian <b>markets,</b> <b>the</b> flight to quality was seldom evident between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond <b>markets.</b> Second, with <b>the</b> exception of <b>the</b> developed American <b>market,</b> there is significant negative spillover between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond <b>markets.</b> This is in line with the previous conclusions.|$|R
5|$|The {{magneto-optical}} drive manufactured by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{market was}} {{featured}} in the 1971 musical film, Bedknobs and Broomsticks in a scene involving a song ("Portobello Road") and dance {{in and around the}} market staged on sets built at Disney's Burbank studios.

25|$|Note {{that there}} are some {{assumptions}} and requirements that have to be fulfilled for the latter to be correct: There must be perfect competition in <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> total number of factors may never surpass the total number of assets (in order to avoid the problem of matrix singularity).|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{especially}} in Britain, the farming community received large monetary incentives to reduce production of certain crops. The establishment of milk quotas was one mechanism employed to enforce production limits on farmers. A particularly good run of summers {{during the period}} 1985–86 saw a large surfeit of produce coming onto <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first intervention stores.|$|E
30|$|To make {{different}} region’s <b>markets</b> more comparable, <b>the</b> {{number of}} the countries is standardized by dividing the total sample number in different regions. The flight to quality occurs from <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> to <b>the</b> long-term <b>and</b> short-term government bond markets in a majority of selected developed countries. However, regarding <b>the</b> emerging <b>markets,</b> in Asian countries the flight to quality only occurs between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, in emerging European counties and a few developed European countries (i.e., Italy and Greece), regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>market</b> is developed or emerging, the negative spillover only happens between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond <b>markets.</b> <b>The</b> negative spillover in Europe suggests that the investors lost their confidence in <b>the</b> recovery <b>and</b> solvency of <b>the</b> European countries during <b>the</b> Subprime Crisis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Debt Crisis periods. In addition, there is no flight from quality or positive spillover in these two crises. To summarize, all the negative spillovers occurred between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond <b>markets</b> while <b>the</b> flight to quality emerged between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond <b>markets.</b> For example, <b>the</b> remarkable flight to quality between <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long-term government bond <b>market</b> appears in <b>the</b> American <b>market</b> because <b>the</b> U.S. government bond {{is considered to be}} the safest asset in times of crisis. The long-term government bonds are less liquid than the short-term government bonds, such that the flight to quality between <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short-term government bond <b>markets</b> is of great significance, which proves that Hypothesis 3 is true.|$|R

30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in <b>the</b> same region. First, the interdependence between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> in <b>the</b> same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of <b>the</b> global GDP, <b>and</b> therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bond <b>markets</b> has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in <b>the</b> Subprime Crisis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or <b>the</b> real estate <b>markets</b> are less liquid and important than government bond markets in most of <b>the</b> emerging <b>markets.</b> Thus, in this paper, our analysis emphasizes <b>the</b> stock <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government bond <b>markets</b> in 39 countries.|$|R
25|$|According {{to western}} {{financial}} markets, {{consolidation of the}} financial sector remains a concern as it continues at a slow pace, with the market split so small that no bank controls more than 10% of <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Taiwanese government is obligated, by the WTO accession treaty, to open this sector between 2005 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, Hollins Market {{stretched}} from Poppleton to Carey Streets, with 160 inside and 180 outside stalls. Over the years, {{an assortment of}} West Baltimore butchers, various European and Asian immigrants with vendor traditions, and African-American merchants have all sold and purchased meats, farm-fresh produce, baked goods, and home-produced wares. Somewhat smaller today, the traditions and diversity of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quality of goods still holds true. The 1990 Barry Levinson film “Avalon” depicts Hollins Market in its heyday.|$|E
25|$|Chestnut was {{the most}} popular wood since its logs could be used to build cabins and rail fences to protect crops from wild animals. It could easily be split into {{shingles}} for roofs to cover cabins and barns. Its bark was used to make medicine and tannic acid for tanning and dyeing. In the fall, its rich nuts were used to fatten razorback hogs for <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> home. Hemlock was also highly valued for its many uses.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} subsisting between {{the operations of}} discount houses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> performance indices of <b>the</b> money <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general economy.

25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first in their influential Technics series of turntables.|$|E
25|$|The Bendix system's public {{debut in}} December 1956 was {{followed}} by a March 1957 price bulletin listing it as a US$395 option, but because of supplier difficulties, EFI Rebels would only be available after June 15. This was to have been the first production EFI engine, but Electrojector's teething problems meant only pre-production cars were so equipped: thus, very few cars so equipped were ever sold, and none were made available to the public. The Rambler's EFI was more advanced than the mechanical types then appearing on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> engines ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures. As a result, all of the production Rebels used a four-barrel carburetor. Nevertheless, the EFI option remained in the published owner's manual.|$|E

25|$|Under a fixed {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the foreign exchange market to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the exchange rate between the country's currency and other currencies. Then the net change {{per year in the}} central bank's foreign exchange reserves is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a {{fixed exchange}} rate system include a managed float where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely floating exchange rate (also known as a purely flexible exchange rate). With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its currency, allowing the rate to be set by <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> central bank's foreign exchange reserves do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.|$|E
25|$|Rhythm {{games like}} Rock Band and Guitar Hero had been widely popular during 2005 to 2008, {{but due to}} {{oversaturation}} of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> onset of the 2009 recession, the rhythm genre suffered major setbacks, and the genre's popularity had quickly waned.

Harmonix would continue to support Rock Band 3 through 2013 with additional content patches and over 280 consecutive weeks of new songs provided as downloadable content (DLC), as well as producing Rock Band Blitz, an arcade-like rhythm game that did not require instrument controllers, but used existing music libraries. In April 2013, Harmonix released its last regular DLC, stating that they were focusing on other projects.
