5|$|A second group, the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, {{has begun}} another PRE {{registry}} {{as an alternative}} to the ANCCE. This new registry claims that all of their registered horses trace back to the original stud book maintained by the Cria Caballar, which was a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Defense, for 100 years. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>PRE</b> Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most authentic, purest PRE registry functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore <b>the</b> <b>PRE</b> packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E

25|$|During each {{of these}} three periods, EEG data were {{collected}} for information on the rats' sleep stages. The mean firing rates of hippocampal place cells during prebehavior SWS (PRE) and three ten-minute intervals in postbehavior SWS (POST) were calculated by averaging across 22 track-running sessions from seven rats. The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean firing rate of hippocampal place cells from <b>the</b> <b>PRE</b> level. After 20 minutes, the mean firing rate returned rapidly toward <b>the</b> <b>PRE</b> level. The elevated firing of hippocampal place cells during SWS after spatial exploration could explain why there were elevated levels of slow-wave sleep in Datta's study, as it also dealt with a form of spatial exploration.|$|E
25|$|Masks vary by {{the kinds}} of {{materials}} used to make them. Wood {{is the most popular}} material for masks. Clay masks were used in <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> Hispanic period and can still be found in Metepec (Locos masks), some for Tastoanes in Jalisco and many of the dances in Michoacán.|$|E
25|$|The {{handcrafts}} of {{the state}} include those which have origins in <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> Hispanic period, and which maintain techniques and aesthetics from that period to at least some extent.

30|$|In {{accordance}} with the previous result on the estimation accuracy (see Figure  1), for SNR lower than 0  dB, all the estimators are in the non-asymptotic region: they do not provide reliable DOA estimates.

In particular, <b>the</b> <b>Pres</b> of <b>the</b> FB is much lower than that of the CSBs and independent of the SNR. Regarding the CSBs, the best estimator, {{at least in terms of}} <b>Pres,</b> is <b>the</b> SPICE algorithm: its Pres, as well as the one of the IAA-APES, tends to 1 as the SNR increases.|$|R

The town chronicler still refers to the barrios as calpulli, the pre-Conquest political organization of neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|Pottery in Metepec and {{the rest}} of the Toluca Valley began in <b>the</b> <b>pre</b> Hispanic period during which both {{utilitarian}} and decorative/ritual items were made.

Another important influence was from the Cholula area of Puebla in the use of polychrome decoration. Decorative techniques included stamping, painting, incising, scraping and raised relief.|$|E
