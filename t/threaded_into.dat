25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts <b>threaded</b> <b>into</b> the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of a bucket bong (or simply a [...] "bucket") calls for a large plastic bottle (about [...] ), a large bucket or other container that both the bottle and {{a large amount of}} water will properly go into, a brass cut nozzle used as the bowl, an aerator screen cut to fit the bowl, and a large bucket or container. The large plastic bottle's base is cut off, and the bottle's cap has a small hole in the center which will eventually hold a bowl. The screen is placed inside of the bowl. The cut nozzle is <b>threaded</b> <b>into</b> the hole outside the cap.|$|E
