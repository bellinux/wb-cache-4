2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Loudest Engine {{took place at}} the Killers' Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas, from September to October 2010. The album was recorded with a Studer A820 2" [...] 24-track reel-to-reel analogue tape machine. 00:07, c 3:00, d 1:25, e3:23. After Joel insisted that the album be recorded to tape, Stoermer sought and acquired the recording unit. The band decided to not record anything that they could not perform live, referring to their last album Radio Wars, which was very electronically oriented. Members of the band stated that they had a lot more freedom than ever before in the studio, {{which is one of the}} reasons they chose Stoermer as a producer. They knew as a musician that he understood the importance of letting a band just play music instead of pressuring them to push their instrument or sound elsewhere. Stoermer researched autobiographies of record producers, including the book, Recording The Beatles, to use as <b>technical</b> <b>reference</b> points for recording the album.|$|E

Through selecting different impact mechanisms during image acquirement and establishing factor-parameters array, the mathematical model of fuzzy gray evaluating system can therefore be structured.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conventional}} {{drainage design}} approach {{does not address}} sustainability issues. Moving forward, an alternative approach using green infrastructures is recommended. In addition to flow and flood management provided by the conventional methods, green infrastructures can bring multiple benefits such as increased amenity value and groundwater recharge. Unlike the traditional practice, the new approach lacks supporting <b>technical</b> <b>references</b> and software. Stakeholders are discouraged by the uncertainty of performance and costs associated with green infrastructures. We aim to bridge this knowledge gap by providing a systematic decision support framework. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the evaluation framework with some application examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{studies the}} impact of steel fiber on the {{performance}} of lightweight aggregate concrete,including compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity and impact toughness. The experimental studies show that steel fiber has little effect on the compressive strength of lightweight aggregate concrete, however, it can improve the pattern obviously. With the increasing of steel fiber content, the flexural strength and impact toughness of concrete increases. With the increasing of steel fiber content,the elastic modulus of concrete also increases. The studies of this paper provide a certain <b>technical</b> <b>references</b> with the future research of steel fiber reinforced lightweight aggregate concrete...|$|R
