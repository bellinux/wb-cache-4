2500|$|In March 2011, MK Otniel Schneller (Kadima) said to Ben-Ami {{during a}} Knesset {{committee}} meeting: [...] "You are not Zionists {{and you do}} not care about Israeli interests. Fifty rockets a day are fired on the South and you fight against the American veto against condemnations of Israel. You are not Zionists {{and you do not}} care about Israel. Only here in Israel do we determine Israeli democracy, and you cannot determine what Israel's interests are." [...] Ben Ami responded by saying, [...] "An absolute parameter has to be the recognition of the fundamental right of the Jewish people to their own state. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> even within the American Jewish community, who are anti-Zionist and who do not recognize that right. Second, they must recognize Israel's right to defend itself against threats – Israel must be strong, because it lives in a hard neighborhood, as we've even seen this morning." ...|$|E

"That is true enough," [...] Cuthbert laughed, [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} that critics do not buy either books or paintings, and that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who buy the idiotic books and are perfectly content with pictures without a particle of artistic merit." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Curtis paused, Miss Wellwood was as pink as her cap strings. Rachel {{grasped the}} meaning at last. [...] "Oh!"

"It {{would be}} safe now, mademoiselle," [...] he said to Marie, [...] "for us to proceed. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> about in the streets; but as the news has, no doubt, already been spread that {{the daughters of the}} Marquis de St. Caux had left the house before those charged with their father's arrest arrived, it will be better for you not to keep together.

But I don't care a straw about the faux pas of the mummies. You do, though. You are one of the historical men--more interested in a lady when she's got a rag face and skeleton toes peeping out.

We've suffered enough, Ambrose, in this country from civil spies--the Government are to blame for that. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who go blustering about, declaring that two of our Cabinet Ministers ought to be hung, who'd turn round and give you the life if you hinted for a moment that the same sort of thing in a far worse degree was going on amongst men who are wearing the King's uniform." ...|$|E
