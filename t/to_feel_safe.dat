5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

Although the creators had been confident that the idea of a book juxtaposing superheroes and the police procedural had not been done previously, the knowledge that Moore was doing something similar nearly led them to abandon the series, before discovering that Top Ten featured superhero police officers and a different enough approach that led them <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> in continuing.|$|E

500|$|... "Electric Chapel" [...] {{was first}} previewed when a one-minute {{portion of its}} {{instrumental}} was used for Gaga's Transmission Gagavision 44 video. With the title's track being displayed on a paper during {{the end of the}} clip, it additionally made an appearance in the music video for [...] "Judas" [...] (2011). Subsequently, Gaga revealed on Twitter that the song was written in Australia and finished on her tour bus in Europe. Describing the recording's lyrical themes as delving on [...] "needing <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> to find love", it was theorized by a writer from Take 40 Australia to be inspired by the singer's 2009 live performance on Australia's The Chapel arena. Like the opening track of Born This Way—"Marry the Night"—the song made its debut on a special edition of social network game FarmVille, called GagaVille and released on May 18, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, choses {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, choses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E
2500|$|When announcing their {{condemnation}} of Cosby, many universities used {{the opportunity to}} voice strong no-tolerance policies of sexual violence of any kind. Brown University said Cosby's alleged actions were [...] "particularly troubling as our university community continues to confront the very real challenges of sexual violence on our campus and in society at large". In Baylor University's statement announcing Cosby's rescinded degree, it added, [...] "Through the efforts of our Title IX Office, we are encouraging victims to report acts of interpersonal and sexual violence, and making sure those suffering {{from the effects of}} such acts are provided the necessary support and services <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe</b> and be academically successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like most commentators, Clausen ignores {{what the}} [...] "war warnings" [...] (and their context) {{explicitly}} warn, though indistinctly, against. Washington, with more complete intelligence than any field command, expected an attack anywhere {{on a list}} of possible locations (Pearl Harbor not among them), and since the Japanese were already committed to Thailand, it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible. Clausen, like most, also ignores what actions Kimmel, Short, and Admiral Claude C. Bloch (Commander, Fourteenth Naval District, responsible for naval facilities in Hawaii) actually took. They took precautions against sabotage, widely expected as a precursor to war, and reported their preparations. The Hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack; no one did so explicitly. Indeed, the prevailing view at the time was Japan could not execute two major naval operations at once, so with the Thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea, the Hawaii commanders had good reason <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
