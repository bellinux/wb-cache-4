60|$|In {{process of}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the front, and chanced to {{arrive on the}} field of action at a {{somewhat}} critical moment.|$|E
60|$|I {{remained}} thus in deep thought, sinking {{further and}} further into the tar-bucket. By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the bottom of it}} I realized that I was in love with Edith Croyden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bob bored me badly, {{though we}} didn't talk much. I {{was driving the}} disc-harrows and he lay in the grass. I had to stop {{for a few minutes}} every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the turning and listen to his remarks." ...|$|E
60|$|Will {{you please}} draw a {{document}} covering these requirements {{and have it}} ready by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> New York (April 14th).|$|R
60|$|I {{shall be}} very glad indeed to see Mary and the {{children}} and hope they may be back by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> Copenhagen, about from the fifth to the tenth of July.|$|R
6000|$|... "Liberty, Signore! We are our own masters; we {{have been}} so since the day when our fathers sacked the castles of the barons, and {{compelled}} their tyrants to become their equals. I think of this each <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> the warm plains of Italy, and return to my cottage a more contented man, for the reflection." ...|$|R
60|$|On the way I {{revolved}} in my {{mind all}} that had occurred within the past two hours, and by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Mr. Harrison's place I had the matter in such shape that I could tell a clear, straightforward story.|$|E
60|$|That very evening I {{went to see}} Irene. My {{brain was}} {{whirling}} even yet, and I hardly knew what I was doing; but the cool air revived me a little, and by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the Lathams' I almost felt myself again.|$|E
60|$|It was {{evening before}} I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home. My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, {{but he had}} disappeared. I looked about {{in the hope of}} seeing a note, but there was none.|$|E
60|$|The ticket {{was soon}} in my possession, and then I asked the ticket seller {{a number of}} {{questions}} concerning the route and the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would <b>reach</b> my destination.|$|R
60|$|He rushed like {{a madman}} from the room, and I {{followed}} {{him as soon as}} I had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> the top of the stairs, he was out of sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "There will be <b>time</b> {{enough when}} <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> civilization," [...] said Tarzan. [...] "I {{do not like}} the things and they only spoil the taste of good meat." ...|$|R
60|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly {{saved me}} {{a portion of}} dinner, which indeed I needed. She called me into the little cabinet to partake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance, {{bringing}} me a glass of wine.|$|E
6000|$|This {{feeling of}} bitterness, of rebellion, of dissatisfaction with myself, wore {{gradually}} away, {{and by the}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Chicago I had resolved to climb high. [...] "I will carry mother and Jessie to comfort and to some small share, at least, {{in the world of}} art," [...] was my resolve. In this way I sought to palliate my selfish plan.|$|E
6000|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{my house}} and had filled my pipe and sat myself down in the {{dilapidated}} cane chair on the veranda, that natural reaction set in which so often follows rejoicing at the escape from a great danger. It was true that no one believed I had cheated them over that thrice-accursed gold mine, but how about other matters? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ludgate Circus,' was the answer. 'The {{only really}} {{satisfying}} moments of my life,' he said, 'have been {{passed in the}} neighbourhood of Ludgate Circus. I leave Piccadilly an unhealthy, unwholesome prig. At Charing Cross I begin to feel my blood stir in my veins. From Ludgate Circus to Cheapside I am a human thing with human feeling throbbing in my heart, and human thought throbbing in my brain--with fancies, sympathies, and hopes. At the Bank my mind becomes a blank. As I walk on, my senses grow coarse and blunted; and by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> Whitechapel <b>I</b> am a poor little uncivilised cad. On the return journey {{it is the same}} thing reversed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Although tempted, {{now that}} I {{was a free}} man, to follow my own fancy, I still was too curious to sec {{what kind of a}} person was my unknown father to deviate either from my route or my {{maternal}} instructions, and in a fortnight's <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> my future Principality.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, in her <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> had not <b>reached</b> {{the point}} where I stopped. The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw her I was still upstairs; and, indeed, I did not half know what I could do till I tried." ...|$|R
6000|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the outer}} {{door of the}} cottage, he was a dark blur in the white blur of the fog which had {{swallowed}} up the cove, and was rising round the house-walls from the grass. I heard him shouting, [...] "Marion!" [...] and a faint mellow answer, far out in the cove, [...] "Hello!" [...] and then-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{smiled again}} and resumed his story. [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the old gate I was dusty as a stage-coach, and this old {{corduroy}} suit {{made me look}} as much like a tramp as anybody. As I came onto the old man he was waterin' a span o' horses at the well. Everything looked about the same, only a little older--he was pretty gray and some thinner--and I calls out kind o' meek-like: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked back}} by my side, talking {{all the way}} of Daphne's many adorable qualities. He {{exhausted}} the dictionary for laudatory adjectives. By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> his door it was not HIS fault if I had not learned that the angelic hierarchy {{were not in the}} running with my pretty cousin for graces and virtues. I felt that Faith, Hope, and Charity ought to resign at once in favour of Miss Daphne Tepping, promoted.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{indeed a}} {{stranger}} here; at least I {{have not been}} at the post {{for a very long}} <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> have just <b>reached</b> {{the end of a long}} voyage." ...|$|R
6000|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> the [...] "Ponnonner," [...] {{it struck}} me that I was as wide awake as a man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, {{at the top of my}} speed, for the doctor's.|$|R
60|$|But {{they noticed}} him first and {{immediately}} charged him, {{for one of}} them had been his guard, and they had both been sent to search for him, his escape having been discovered between the time he left the cave and the <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> it. Evidently they had wasted precious moments looking for him in other portions of the mesa.|$|R
60|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the ridge, I had {{discovered}} that she had prophesied truly, for now an ominous change had come over nature. A dull grey vapour had overspread the entire western half of the heavens; down, beyond the forest, the sky looked black as ink, and behind this blackness the sun had vanished. It {{was too late to}} go back now; I had been too long absent from Rima, and could only hope to reach Nuflo's lodge, wet or dry, before night closed round me in the forest.|$|E
60|$|Dick galloped {{off through}} the forest, and Hiram went down the slope in almost the {{opposite}} direction. Left alone, I turned my horse and drove the pack-ponies along our back-trail. Thus engaged, I began to recover somewhat from the terror that had stupefied me. Still, I kept looking back. I found {{the mouth of the}} canyon and the trail, and in what I thought a very short <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the bare, rocky spot where we had last camped. The horses all drank thirstily, and I discovered that I was hot and dry.|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought about}} it the madder I got, {{so that by the}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the valley I was furious, and the result of it was that I turned right around and went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down. I saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave, but I bolted right in after her. She was lying upon her face on the pile of grasses I had {{gathered}} for her bed. When she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like a tigress.|$|E
60|$|In {{the road}} below me were three figures,--a lady, a gentleman, {{and a little}} girl. As the latter turned towards the lady who {{addressed}} her, I recognized the unmistakable copper-colored tresses, trim figure, delicate complexion, and refined features of the friend of my youth! I seized my hat, but by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> the road, they had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|Art, like law, is the {{perfection}} of reason, and whatever is unreasonable {{in the work of}} an artist is inartistic. By the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> these bold conclusions I was ready to deduce a principle from them, and to declare that in a true civilization such a thing as that Hamlet would be forbidden, as an offence against public morals, a violence to something precious and sacred.|$|R
5000|$|... “In due <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> again <b>reached</b> the “white hill,” Veatch {{wrote in}} a letter that now serves as a history of {{discovering}} the Sulphur Bank and Borax Lake. [...] "I now discovered, for the first time, that the “white hill” was mostly a mass of sulphur fused by volcanic heat. The external crust, composed of sulphur mixed with sand and earthy impurities, formed a concrete covering of a whitish appearance, hiding the truenature of the mass beneath." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as my duties at St. Nathaniel's {{permitted}} me, on {{the evening}} of the discovery, I rushed round to Mrs. Mallet's, Le Geyt's sister. I had been detained at the hospital for some hours, however, watching a critical case; and by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Great Stanhope Street I found Hilda Wade, in her nurse's dress, there before me. Sebastian, it seemed, had given her leave out for the evening. She was a supernumerary nurse, attached to his own observation-cots as special attendant for scientific purposes, and she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{fear that}} I shall {{never be a}} true knight," [...] Edgar said, with a smile. [...] "I have heard tales of knights {{carrying}} damsels across their shoulder and outstripping the pursuit of caitiffs, from whom she had escaped. I indeed had believed them, but assuredly either those tales are false or I have but a small share {{of the strength of}} which I believed myself to be possessed; for, in truth, my arm and shoulder ached by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the hostelry more than it has ever done after an hour's practice with the mace." ...|$|E
60|$|I was choking and suffocating by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Wolf Larsen’s bunk. I {{reached my}} hand and felt for his. He was lying motionless, but moved {{slightly}} {{at the touch of}} my hand. I felt over and under his blankets. There was no warmth, no sign of fire. Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source. I lost my head temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage. A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself. I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not say}} I have no fear," [...] {{the doctor}} replied. [...] "I do my duty so far as I can, but I do not doubt that, sooner or later, I shall catch the malady, as {{many of us have}} done already. I take such {{precautions}} as I can, but the distemper seems to baffle all precautions. My only grief is that our skill avails so little. So far we have found nothing that seems to be of any real use. Perhaps if we could attack it in the earlier stages we might be more successful. The strange nature of the disease, {{and the way in which}} it does its work well-nigh to the end, before the patient is himself aware of it, puts it out of our power to combat it. In many cases I am not sent for until the patient is at the point of death, and by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> his door <b>I</b> am met with the news that he is dead. But I must be going." ...|$|R
60|$|Turning my thoat, I {{urged him}} after her, hoping {{to reach her}} side and bear her on again in our hopeless flight. Carthoris must have glanced behind him {{at about the same}} time and taken in the situation, for by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had <b>reached</b> Thuvia's side he was there also, and, {{springing}} from his mount, he threw her upon its back and, turning the animal's head toward the hills, gave the beast a sharp crack across the rump with the flat of his sword. Then he attempted to do the same with mine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, Kagawa {{released}} the album Out of Mind through the Bellwood Records label (:ja:ベルウッド・レコード). In 1975, {{he appeared in}} the musical Juugatsu ha tasogare no kuni October, Land of Twilight, produced by musical theatre troupe Tokyo Kid Brothers, composing the music for the production and serving as its sound producer. The same year, he would participate in the recording of Nakagawa Isato's omnibus live album Hanauta to otsuki-san Hummed Tunes and Mister Moon with fellow artists Ito Takao, Otsuka Masaji, Kanamori Kosuke, Shiba, Nishioka Kyozo and Osada 'Taco' Kazuyoshi in Kobe. Kagawa would follow these projects with the albums Minami-yuki no haiuei Southbound Highway, which he recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1976, and Komazawa atari de Somewhere Around Komazawa, which he recorded with rock band Lazy Hip in 1978. In the 1990s, Kagawa {{would go on to}} record more albums, including One (1991) and 2 (1993). Over a four-decade career, Kagawa's eclectic musical style incorporated elements of folk, rock, and pop; {{in an interview with the}} Asahi Newspaper in 2001, the artist expressed a hope that he [...] "might find my own music by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> 120 years of age or so." ...|$|R
