40|$|Inversion of {{transient}} electromagnetic (TEM) {{data sets}} to image the subsurface three-dimensional (3 -D) electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability properties {{can be done}} directly in the time domain. The technique, first introduced by Wang et al. (1994) for causal and diffusive electromagnetic fields and subsequently implemented by Zhdanov and Portniaguine (1997) {{in the framework of}} iterative migration, is based upon imaging methods originally developed for seismic wavefields (Claerbout, 1971; Tarantola, 1984). In this paper we advance the original derivations of Wang et al. (1994) and Zhdanov and Portniaguine (1997) to treat non-causal TEM fields, as well as correct a flaw in the theory for treatment of magnetic field data. Our 3 D imaging scheme is based on a conjugate-gradient search for the minimum of an error functional involving EM measurements governed by Maxwell's equations without displacement currents. Treatment for magnetic field, voltage (time derivative of the magnetic field) and electric field data are given. The functional can be computed by propagating the data errors back into the model in reverse time along with a DC field, sourced by the integrated data errors over the measurement time range. By correlating these fields, including the time-integrated back-propagated fields, with the corresponding incident field and its initial value at each image point, efficient computational forms for the gradients are developed. The forms of the gradients allow for additional efficiencies when voltage and electric field data are inverted. In such instances the combined data errors can be back-propagated jointly, significantly reducing the computation time required to solve the inverse problem. The inversion algorithm is applied to the long offset <b>transient</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>measurement</b> (LOTEM) configuration thereby demonstrating its capability in inverting non-causal field measurements of electric field and voltage, sourced by a grounded wire, over complex structures. Findings also show that migration, without iteration or preconditioning, is not an effective imaging strategy; reconstructions at the first inversion iteration bear little resemblance to simple or complex test models...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMagnetic {{resonance}} sounding (MRS) is an electromagnetic method {{designed for}} groundwater investigations. MRS {{can be applied}} not only for studying fresh-water aquifers, but also in areas where intrusion of saline water is rendering the subsurface electrically conductive. In the presence of rocks with a high electrical-conductivity attenuation and a phase shift of the MRS signal may influence {{the efficiency of the}} MRS method. We investigated the performance of MRS for allowing us to propose a procedure for interpreting MRS data under these conditions. For numerical modeling, we considered a subsurface with a resistivity between 0. 5 and 10 Ω m. The results show that the depth of investigation with MRS depends upon the electrical conductivity of groundwater and surrounding rocks, on the depth of the saline water layer, and on the amount of fresh water above the saline water. For interpreting MRS measurements, the electrical conductivity of the subsurface is routinely measured with an electrical or electromagnetic method. However, due to the equivalence problem, the result obtained with these methods may be not unique. Hence, we investigated the influence of the uncertainty in conductivity distribution provided by <b>transient</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> (TEM) on MRS results. It was found that the uncertainty in TEM results has an insignificant effect on MRS...|$|R

The method of Transient Electromagnetic(TEM) detection is widely {{applied to the}} field of coal mine and oil exploration. But since <b>Transient</b> <b>Electromagnetic</b> signal is a non-stationary, nonlinear, weak signal under the background of heavy noise, traditional method which is based on the signal superposition is only suited to the signal of the superficial layer, it can not fetch the weak signal of the deep layer. noise reduction of the <b>transient</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> weak signal under heavy noise based on power detection of EMD decomposition is presented in this paper. This method does not need prior information. Through the method, the <b>transient</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> weak signal under heavy noise is decomposed to several intrinsic mode functions.
