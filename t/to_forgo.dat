40|$|We analyze how firms {{might benefit}} from trading {{restrictions}} {{in the market for}} technology. We show that restricting trade to reciprocal exchange (“IP-for-IP” barter instead of cash transactions), as in cross-licensing agreements, alters the allocation of R&D resources and reduces overinvestment in R&D. The tighter are the trading restrictions, the higher are the costs that are due <b>to</b> <b>forgone</b> gains from trade. Our analysis of the trade-offs involved shows that firms benefit from IP-for-IP restrictions, compared to both free trade and no trade environments, in industries where: (1) firms differ in their capabilities to commercialize IP; and (2) patent complementarities exist...|$|R

40|$|Conducting {{cost-benefit}} {{analyses of}} health and safety regulations requires placing a dollar value on reductions in health risks, including the risk of death. In the United States, mortality risks are often valued using compensating-wage differentials. These differentials measure what a worker {{would have to be}} paid to accept a small increase in his risk of death-which is assumed to equal what the worker would pay to achieve a small reduction in his risk of death. The authors estimate compensating-wage differentials for risk of fatal and nonfatal injuries in India's manufacturing industry. They estimate a hedonic wage equation using the most recent Occupational Wage Survey, supplemented by data on occupational injuries from the Indian Labour Yearbook. Their estimates of compensating-wage differentials imply a value of statistical life (VSL) in India of 6. 4 million to 15 million 1990 rupees (roughly $ 150, 000 to $ 360, 000 at current exchange rates). This number is between 20 and 48 times forgone earnings-the human capital measure of the value of reducing the risk of death. The ratio of the VSL <b>to</b> <b>forgone</b> earnings implied by the study is larger than in comparable U. S. studies but smaller than the ratio implied by the only other compensating-wage study for India (Shanmugam 1997). The latter implies a ratio of VSL <b>to</b> <b>forgone</b> earnings of 73 ! The authors caution that in India, as in the United States, compensating-wage differentials in the labor market may overstate what individuals would themselves pay {{to reduce the risk of}} death. They suggest using their estimates as an upper boundon willingness to pay to reduce risk of death, and forgone earnings as a lower bound.

40|$|Informal care by {{close family}} members {{is the main}} pillar of most longterm care systems. However, due to {{demographic}} ageing the need for long-term care {{is expected to increase}} while the informal care potential is expected to decline. From a budgetary perspective, informal care is often viewed as a cost-saving alternative to subsidized formal care. This view, however neglects that many family carers are of working age and face the difficulty to reconcile care and paid work which might entail sizable indirect fiscal effects related <b>to</b> <b>forgone</b> tax revenues, lower social security contributions and higher transfer payments. In this paper we use a structural model of labor supply and the choice of care arrangement to quantify these indirect fiscal effects of informal care.

40|$|Economic {{evaluations}} of clinical treatments most commonly {{take the form}} of cost effectiveness or cost utility analyses.

The majority of economic evaluations in public health, however, have also been assessed using these techniques when arguably cost benefit analyses would in many cases have been more appropriate, given its ability to take account of nonhealth benefits as well.

40|$|We analyse the {{following}} policy dilemma: strategic trade policy versus free trade when the domestic government {{is bound to}} intervene only after the domestic firm's strategic variable {{in the form of}} R&D investment is chosen, and when the information can be either symmetric or asymmetric. The novel feature of our model is that the information asymmetry stems from the assumption that the government may not a priori know the true mode of competition. The intervention in the above set-up allows the domestic firm to manipulate the domestic government and results in a socially inefficient choice of the strategic variable. However, commitment to free trade leads <b>to</b> <b>forgoing</b> the benefits from profit-shifting. Yet, from the social point of view, free trade may be optimal even under the assumption of symmetric information. Due to costly signalling, this result is reinforced in the case of asymmetric information.
