5|$|Nonetheless, on October 2, 1925, the 95th Street subway station, {{which was}} built mainly in {{anticipation}} for the Staten Island Tunnel, was opened. The station was built with a false wall at its south end, intended for either a planned extension to 100th or 101st Streets or a line leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> Fort Hamilton-based tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Other {{projects}} {{include the}} realignment of Donelson Pike {{to the east}} and a multi-modal transit link <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> Nashville transit system. Construction began in 2017 on the new Parking and Transportation Center. To accommodate the immediate need for more international service, the existing international arrivals building is being upgraded on an interim basis while the permanent IAB is planned and constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} fully {{handicapped}} accessible, with two full-length high-level platforms and elevators to cross from one track to another. The overhead pedestrian bridge {{is designed to}} connect <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> deck between Brookline Avenue and Beacon Street {{as part of the}} Fenway Center project. The main entrance to the station is on Overland Street between the two major streets; staircases to Beacon Street are also available from the west ends of the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, {{was seen as a}} rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are being}} made to Union Station, which is the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 2003, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle {{signed an}} {{agreement}} in principle {{to develop a plan}} for light rail expansion to the airport. The agreement envisioned a light rail station along International Boulevard near South 175th Street connected to the airport's terminal via the existing parking garage, with enhanced pedestrian connections and connections <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> hotel {{at the north end of}} the garage. The two agencies also agreed to work together on planning and engineering for the project, which would be built in conjunction with a realignment of the Airport Expressway. The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The Raid on Saint-Paul was an amphibious {{operation}} {{conducted by a}} combined British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines force against the fortified French port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte (now known as Réunion) during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation was launched on 20September 1809 as both a precursor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> full-scale invasion of Île Bonaparte {{and in order to}} capture the French frigate Caroline and the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were sheltering in the harbour. The operation was a complete success, with British storming parties capturing the batteries overlooking the port, which allowed a naval squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the bay and capture the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) is death, Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular bone in his right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase {{to hold up the}} title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E
