5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} her illness has been debated by contemporaries and historians. Secretary of Giovanni Francesco Commendone claimed that her illness {{was caused by}} her use of {{contraceptive}} measures. Radziwiłłs in their letters debated whether she had a sexually transmitted disease. There were persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Bona Sforza. Modern historians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it was cervical or ovarian cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the {{satisfaction}} of college students with their grades. Medvec and Savitsky studied satisfaction of college students based on whether their grade just missed the cut off versus if they had just made the cutoff for a category. Students that just made it into a grade category <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> downward counterfactual <b>think</b> and were more satisfied, thinking it could be worse. These students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in terms of [...] "At least I." [...] However, students that were extremely close to making it into the next highest category showed higher dissatisfaction and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> upward counterfactual <b>think,</b> or focus on how the situation could have been better. These students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in terms of [...] "I could have." ...|$|R

The Positive "Narratives of Self" {{were presented to}} university students and their reactions were measured {{by means of a}} paper-based research. As the result, their impressions were partially different by their sexes or their own self-perceptions; Subjects whose self-perception was positive <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the person who narrated the positive "Narrative of Self" as friendly. And male subjects <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the person who narrated the positive "Narrative of Self" as unreliable.

25|$|Items {{from the}} shanty and sea song {{repertoire}} {{have been brought}} into the repertoires of performers of folk music, rock, and Western classical music. Sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers. The forms these performers produce tend to be quite standardized and relate to their source material {{similar to the way}} a cover song does. This can be contrasted with the method of performers focusing on maritime music, who <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of themselves as operating within that genre or a tradition, and who develop their repertoire from multiple sources and through various experiences.|$|E
25|$|A vast majority, 94%, {{are raised}} {{in memory of}} men, but, {{contrary}} to common perception, {{the vast majority of}} the runestones are raised in memory of people who died at home. The most famous runestones and those that people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of are those that tell of foreign voyages, but they comprise only c. 10% of all runestones, and they were raised in usually memory of those not having returned from Viking expeditions and not as tributes to those having returned. These runestones contain roughly the same message as the majority of the runestones, which is that people wanted to commemorate one or several dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that females <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more about their body shape and endorse thinner figures than men even into old age. When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image {{in a number of different}} ways and from a variety of sources.|$|E

5000|$|Misrepresentation {{refers to}} the danger of {{conveying}} a wrong message. The audience <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a performance as genuine or false, and performers generally wish to avoid having an audience disbelieve them (whether they are being truly genuine or not).|$|R
50|$|In the 21st century {{observers}} find {{it increasingly}} difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way.

25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E
25|$|According to {{one survey}} from 2006, around 81% of Muslims think of {{themselves}} as Muslim first. Muslims living in Muslim-majority countries also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of themselves as Muslim first rather than identifying with nation states (for example 87% of Pakistanis identify themselves as Muslim first rather than Pakistani). However around 83% of Muslims are proud to be a British citizen, compared to 79% of the general public, 77% of Muslims strongly identify with Britain while only 50% of the wider population do, 86.4% of Muslims feel they belong in Britain, slightly more than the 85.9% of Christians, 82% of Muslims want to live in diverse and mixed neighbourhoods compared to 63% of non-Muslim Britons. In polls taken across Europe 2006, British Muslims hold the most negative view of westerners out of all Muslims in Europe, whilst overall in Britain 63% of British hold the most favourable view of Muslims out of all the European countries (down from 67% the year before).|$|E

500|$|Garfield's biographers, {{and those}} who have studied his {{presidency}}, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, [...] "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." [...] Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, [...] "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more." [...] Rutkow writes, [...] "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the term}} [...] "culture" [...] applies to {{non-human}} animals {{only if we}} define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved {{to be different from}} other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for [...] "culture".|$|E
2500|$|Other {{scholars}} dispute {{this theory}} and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that statues and necropolis {{were part of}} the same complex. In this view it is incorrect to hold as a sole hint for this hypotheses the closeness of the sculpture to the mortuary complex. In tomb number six of the [...] "Tronchetti’s area", a piece of scrap for manufacturing shields was discovered, leading to the suggestion that the statues had been sculpted on the site and expressly for the necropolis.|$|E

40|$|Background: Few {{investigations}} {{have focused on}} nursing students from a developing country {{in relation to a}} developed country like Japan. Objective: This study explored differences between the nursing students in Madagascar and Japan. Subjects and Methods: This is a prospective analytical study of 63 nursing students— 32 Japanese and 31 Malagasy. Questionnaires were distributed to students in Madagascar and Japan in 2010 and collected for statistical analysis. Results: Malagasy students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that nursing plays a psychological role, and they have positive view for this function. In contrast, Japanese students <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that nursing is physical work and they make a point of its outcome and the need for social and economic guarantees. Conclusion: The nursing students in Madagascar and Japan expressed different views and goals. While several factors may be involved in these differences, their distinct medical situations are most likely the major contributor...|$|R
2500|$|According to Ellwood, the mythologists {{believed}} in gnosticism's basic doctrines (even if in a secularized form).

2500|$|Although {{these issues}} are mathematically significant, even when {{controlling}} for these factors, nearly all people still think {{each of the two}} unopened doors has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter (Mueser and Granberg, 1999).

[...] People strongly <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> probability is evenly distributed across as many unknowns as are present, whether it is or not (...)

2500|$|Sissi as a {{description}} {{is a person}} of extraordinary stamina (or Sisu) – e.g. [...] "Sissi weather" [...] (Sissin sää) refers to the worst possible weather conditions, for sissi soldiers prefer these for their operations, since bad weather <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> distract enemy soldiers (any normal soldier <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about getting <b>to</b> shelter {{as soon as possible}} when bad weather strikes) and hide any noise caused by sissis.|$|R
