In order to keep the fuel tank close to the center of gravity, the only available position was in the forward fuselage, ahead of the cockpit.

In addition, 150lb of armor plate was installed, along with a [...] bullet-proof windscreen which was set internally, behind the curved Plexiglas windscreen. The canopy could be jettisoned in an emergency, and half-elliptical planform transparent panels, much like those of certain models of the Curtiss P-40, were inset into the sides of the fuselage's turtledeck structure behind the pilot's headrest, providing the pilot with a limited rear view over his shoulders. A rectangular Plexiglas panel was inset into the lower center section to allow the pilot to see directly beneath the aircraft and assist with deck landings. The engine used was the more powerful R-2800-8 (B series) Double Wasp which produced 2,000hp (1,491kW). On the wings the flaps were changed to a NACA slotted type and the ailerons were increased in span to increase the roll rate, with a consequent reduction in flap span.

50|$|A short {{baseline}} (SBL) acoustic {{positioning system}} {{is one of}} three broad classes of underwater acoustic positioning systems that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are ultra short baseline systems (USBL) and long baseline systems (LBL). Like USBL systems, SBL systems do not require any seafloor mounted <b>transponders</b> or <b>equipment</b> and are thus suitable for tracking underwater targets from boats or ships that are either anchored or under way. However, unlike USBL systems, which offer a fixed accuracy, SBL positioning accuracy improves with transducer spacing. Thus, where space permits, such as when operating from larger vessels or a dock, the SBL system can achieve a precision and position robustness that {{is similar to that of}} sea floor mounted LBL systems, making the system suitable for high-accuracy survey work. When operating from a smaller vessel where transducer spacing is limited (i.e. when the baseline is short), the SBL system will exhibit reduced precision.|$|R

Then we verify the three algorithms on time-delay of the braking system and the initial speed of the train in Train Station Parking simulation platform.

5000|$|The 1980 Turbocharged {{model was}} given the name Turbo Saratoga SP. The name and model {{designation}} stayed the same through the 1996 model year, despite several updates to the airplane during that time. Starting with the 1997 model year the airplane received a new designation, the Saratoga II TC, and a new Lycoming TIO-540-AH1A engine. Externally the biggest difference was the new cowl, with much smaller, round air inlets. 1997-1998 Saratoga II TC's featured a King avionics suite, which was switched to dual Garmin GNS-430's and a GTX-320 transponder with the 1999 models. In mid-2000 model year the avionics were again updated, with one Garmin GNS-430 and one GNS-530 and a GTX-327 <b>transponder</b> as standard <b>equipment.</b> Beginning in 2004 the Saratoga models were available with an Avidyne Entegra [...] "Glass Panel" [...] avionics system, which {{was replaced by the}} Garmin G1000 in 2007.|$|R

It actually came in two versions.

This variant was more popular abroad than the MiG-23MS and considerable numbers were exported, especially to the Middle East.|$|R
40|$|Linear {{optimization}} {{has been}} exhaustively used for resource conservation and network design/planning. The primary assumption facilitating {{the use of}} linear optimization is that traffic {{is assumed to be}} deterministic, which in reality is not the case. In the domain of optical networks, the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem for provisioning lightpaths or optical circuits is well known and is solved using constrained linear optimization. However, with emerging service requirements such as Triple Play, Video-on-Demand (VoD) and Pseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge Emulation (PWE 3), the optimization involves stochastic parameters for dynamic service provisioning. Alternate solutions to lightpath communication that solve the paradox between maximizing dynamism as well as maintaining high-efficiency are proposed. In the electronic domain, solutions such as Resilient Packet Rings (RPR) and Next Generation Packet-Over-SONET (NG-POS) have been considered. Conversely, in the all-optical domain light-trails, have been proposed as a solution to meet requirements of these emerging services. Optimal allocation of resources and subsequent network design is not possible using traditional linear programming approaches due to the time-variant nature of traffic and architectural properties of these optical and electronic solutions. Stochastic optimization -a technique that assumes probabilistic nature of traffic is a promising approach for planning and allocation of resources in a network. This paper discusses application of stochastic optimization to high-speed all-optical networks, in particular, to the emerging concept of light-trail networks. Light-trails are a generalized lightpath that enable dynamic sharing of a wavelength leading to efficient network utilization. A stochastic formulation for design of light-trail networks in metropolitan rings is presented. A simpler (tractable) formulation is also developed using a quantization hypothesis that restricts the solution space. T- he formulation is then abstracted to the well known Bender's decomposition method for solving stochastic optimization problems. The formulation is evaluated under varying traffic conditions. Results are obtained and compared with linear optimization. Cost savings in terms of network <b>equipment</b> (<b>transponders)</b> is presented. © IEE...|$|R
