5|$|After {{retrieving}} the weapon, Jeremy {{is informed}} that the Lords of Pikehold, a group of knights that defends the area, have defeated the vampire army carrying the blood seal. On his way to Pikehold Castle, Jeremy is then ambushed by Castello. The pair fight Castello, who falls off a cliff after being defeated. Inside Pikehold Castle, Jeremy discovers that the Lords of Pikehold have become thralls to a succubus. Jeremy and Alysa defeat the Lords of Pikehold and the succubus, who informs Jeremy that the Blood Seal has been taken by a vampire mage to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mountain.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter. D'Amore interfered in the contest several times by distracting Hoyt, the referee, or aiding Roode in some way. Roode won the bout after performing his signature Northern Lariat maneuver at 7 minutes and 24 seconds. After the bout, Hoyt performed a backflip splash from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> padded turnbuckle onto a prone D'Amore in the ring.|$|E

5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which the British and the colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. The road was known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston Post Road) until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Uxbridge {{adopted the}} Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Intrepid in 1942, to help towards the ship's costs; Intrepid {{was lost to}} enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed over <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven {{people were killed and}} 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described from New England (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people. A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tank where the plates {{were more or less}} horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E

5|$|Over time, Marshall came {{to believe}} that Eichelberger's talents were wasted at West Point, but he was opposed by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at West Point.
