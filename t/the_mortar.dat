5|$|The M4 was {{developed}} to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car, which the M21 soon replaced. The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar. In emergencies, <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> could be fired from the vehicle. The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> could be fired from the vehicle, but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse. This caused problems when the troops who operated <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> mounted the vehicle, so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August while {{conducting}} a harassment and interdiction mission aboard Point Arden, a misfire occurred with <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> killing Lieutenant Junior Grade Michael W. Kirkpatrick, the cutter's executive officer, and Engineman First Class Michael H. Painter.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic {{rocks are}} {{commonly}} used as aggregate or pozzolan in ancient mortars. Generally natural pozzolans are pyroclastic rocks with rhyolitic composition and high amount of glass. In ancient Greece <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> were prepared using the volcanic tuff from Santorini island. In Roman times <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> of several monuments were prepared with pozzolans from Pozzuoli (near to Vesuvius volcano), as the famous Pantheon and Collesium in Rome. The artificial pozzolans represented by ceramic products (cocciopesto), as bricks, pottery and tiles. The Romans used both kinds of pozzolans to give hydraulic characteristics to <b>the</b> <b>mortars,</b> conglomerates and concretes exposed {{to the presence of}} moisture or water (e. g., foundations, rudus of floors, trullisatio-plasters, cisterns, wells, aqueducts, thermal baths). This work shows a comparison of geochemical, petrographic and physical characterization by OM, SEM-EDS, XRF, XRD, TGA-DSC analysis, He-porosimetry and PLT test of pozzolanic volcanics used in <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> of some ancient Italian Roman building...|$|R

5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower was painted with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry. <b>The</b> <b>mortar</b> began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{there was}} a bomb {{explosion}} in <b>the</b> <b>Mortar</b> Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35injured. No one {{claimed responsibility for the}} blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> M1 <b>mortar</b> is an American 81 {{millimeter}} caliber mortar. It {{was based}} on <b>the</b> French Brandt <b>mortar.</b> <b>The</b> M1 <b>mortar</b> was used from World War II until the 1950s when it {{was replaced by the}} lighter and longer ranged M29 mortar.|$|R
30|$|Mortar {{strength}} tests follow the Chinese standard GB/T 17671 – 1999 on {{method of testing}} cements-determination of strength. The mix proportion of <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> was 0.3 : 0.7 : 3 (ash: cement: medium sand), and <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> were prepared at the water requirement of normal consistency. The specimens were cured constantly in (20  ±  2) °C saturated moist atmosphere after casting and demoulding.|$|R
5000|$|To correct {{shortcomings}} of <b>the</b> 82-mm <b>mortar</b> Model 1941 it was modernised during initial production; {{the construction of}} the bipod, wheel and fastening of the sight was changed. <b>The</b> modernised <b>mortar</b> was called <b>the</b> 82-mm <b>mortar</b> Model 1943.|$|R
5|$|The Romans made durable {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for load-bearing walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. <b>The</b> <b>mortar</b> included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic material that {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion {{for the first time}} to write their names and the date of their visit on <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled an arms {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier.|$|E
5000|$|Next to <b>the</b> Monster <b>Mortar,</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>mortars</b> ever {{developed}} {{were two}} 36 in caliber mortar: <b>the</b> Mallet's <b>Mortar,</b> designed by Robert Mallet and {{tested by the}} Woolwich Arsenal, London, in 1857, and the [...] "Little David" [...] developed in the United States for use in World War II). These mortars never showed action.|$|R
50|$|Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company won the {{contract}} {{at a price}} of £4,300 per <b>mortar.</b> <b>The</b> company's bankruptcy resulted in the work being divided among three firms which managed to deliver <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> in May 1857.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Super-absorbent polymer {{particles}} (SAPs) {{were used}} as a self-curing admixture for <b>mortars.</b> <b>The</b> effect of SAPs on mechanical properties of <b>mortars</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> performance of <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> with SAPs added by two different ways was tested, which showed that the way of adding dried was more feasible to application. <b>The</b> performance of <b>mortars</b> with different curing methods was also tested. The results showed that SAPs in <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> played a role of reserving water and the mechanical properties of hardened mortars with SAPs were better than those had no SAPs and exposed to the air, which suggested that incorporating SAPs {{can be an effective}} self-curing method...|$|R
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. <b>The</b> <b>mortar</b> fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks sparingly joined with mortar. Inside the apse, <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E

5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW launcher which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of the}} 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from <b>the</b> <b>mortar,</b> machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. <b>The</b> <b>mortar</b> operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|The Army Council instead sanctioned {{a mortar}} attack on Downing Street, and in mid-1990 two IRA members {{travelled}} to London {{to plan the}} attack. One of the IRA members was knowledgeable about <b>the</b> trajectory of <b>mortars</b> and <b>the</b> other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage, and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials needed to make <b>the</b> <b>mortars.</b> <b>The</b> IRA unit began making <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> and cutting {{a hole in the}} roof of the van for <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990 Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should still go ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to be meeting at Downing Street, and waited until the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known.|$|R

5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of a}} German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (<b>The</b> <b>Mortar</b> Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (<b>The</b> <b>Mortar</b> Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Triet's 1,200-strong {{regiment}} {{was joined}} by 200 soldiers from the C1 Company of Rear Service Group 83—under the command of Captain Nguyen Van Lam—and {{they set up a}} three-sided ambush and waited for the arrival of a reported U.S. battalion. At around 8:00am on the morning of October 17, the 2nd Battalion departed from their night defensive position with Alpha Company in the lead followed by the Battalion Command Group, and the tail of the formation was covered by Delta Company. Bravo Company stayed behind to protect the battalion's base, along with <b>the</b> <b>mortar</b> sections of Alpha and Delta Companies. In accordance with the 1st Brigade's policy, Allen personally led his unit out as part of the Battalion Command Group, although he preferred to supervise actions from a helicopter. For artillery support, Alpha Company was authorized to call upon the 105mm and 155mm howitzers located at Fire Support Bases Caisson V, Caisson III-S and Lorraine III.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{evidence}} on <b>the</b> use of <b>mortars</b> to meet several needs {{has existed for}} millennia. With reference to the characteristic historical periods {{of the city of}} Rhodes, mortar sampling was performed on historical constructions, masonry and architectural surfaces. In the present work <b>the</b> different <b>mortar</b> technologies are investigated aiming to answer questions regarding their finality, i. e. whether their differences arise mainly from the various historical periods of construction or from the purposes they had to serve, imparting to <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> <b>the</b> properties required by their function in the structure. Mineralogical, chemical, physical and mechanical investigations have been performed on characteristic samples after gradation. The exponentially declining function of the ratio CO 2 /H 2 O structurally bound to the CO 2 content shows a continuous evolution of the kinetics governing the various mechanisms of carbonation of the binder or the formation of hydraulic components during setting, hardening and ageing of <b>the</b> <b>mortars.</b> <b>The</b> grouping of <b>mortars</b> in well-distinct 'hydraulic levels' is ascribed to the physico-chemical cohesion and adhesion bonds developed at the matrix and matrix/aggregate interfaces, respectively, allowing for <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> to either bear continuous stresses and strains as joint mortars or provide compact impermeable renderings which harden even more on contact with water. Hence, parameters determining the diversification of the resulting mortar: matrix types concern the raw materials employed as binding materials and the production processing.

40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{images were}} obtained and analysed using image analysis. The ratio between maximum and minimum Ferret diameter {{were used to}} obtain the aspect ratio (Ferret min/Ferret max) of the particles. Edge objects were excluded in the measurement. In the assessment of orientation objects with low aspect ratio were excluded. The aspect ratio can, presented as cumulative diagrams, be used as one tool to identify {{the source of the}} aggregate and to compare the aggregate in different samples. Other tools that can be used are mineralogical composition and aggregate size distribution. The aggregate orientation measured as the orientation of the longest axis of the particle {{can be used as a}} tool for assessment of surface treatment of <b>the</b> fresh <b>mortar.</b> A strong orientation of the aggregate particles near the surface implies a tooling of the surface. A lack of orientation implies a mortar of low workability or only little tooling of <b>the</b> fresh <b>mortar.</b> <b>The</b> analysed <b>mortars</b> range from pure lime mortars to hydraulic mortars with and without pozzolanic additives. <b>The</b> <b>mortars</b> come from buildings in southern and central Sweden and the age of <b>the</b> <b>mortars</b> date from <b>the</b> 16 th to the 20 th century...|$|R
