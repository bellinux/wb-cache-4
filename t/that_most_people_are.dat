2500|$|The Apostle Paul himself {{never married}} and {{realized}} the practical advantages of remaining single. However, {{he referred to}} contentment in celibacy as “a gift,” and sexual desire as the more common condition of people. [...] For this reason, he recommends <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> better off married, in order to preclude being tempted beyond what they can bear or going through life “burning with passion.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A central {{feature of}} agreeableness is its {{positive}} association with altruism and helping behaviour. Across situations, {{people who are}} high in agreeableness {{are more likely to}} report an interest and involvement with helping others. Experiments have shown <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> likely to help their own kin, and help when empathy has been aroused. Agreeable people are likely to help even when these conditions are not present. In other words, agreeable people appear to be [...] "traited for helping" [...] and do not need any other motivations.|$|E

50|$|Opposition to {{metrication}} was not widespread. The Metric Conversion Board did {{not proceed}} with education programmes as polling revealed <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> learning units and their application independently of each other, rendering efforts {{to teach the}} systematic nature of the metric system unnecessary and possibly {{increasing the amount of}} opposition.|$|R

2500|$|There {{was no real}} consensus, {{at least}} among {{surviving}} Roman texts and epitaphs, {{of what happened to}} a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, {{that there are people who}} believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It is important to keep in mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.|$|E
2500|$|Zoya's {{favorite}} subject in school was literature. Her teachers noted her essays for {{deep understanding of}} the subject and for imagery. She read far beyond the curriculum. The list of authors she read included Leo Tolstoy, Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Karamzin, Vasily Zhukovsky, Byron, Molière, Miguel Cervantes, Charles Dickens, Wolfgang Goethe, and William Shakespeare. Zoya kept a notebook where she recorded her thoughts about the books she read. Such as: [...] "In Shakespeare's tragedies {{the death of a}} hero is always accompanied by a triumph of a high moral cause." [...] She liked Beethoven's Egmont and often sang Klärchen's song [...] "Die Trommel gerühret." [...] Her favorite music was Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. Her striving for high ideals led to misunderstandings with her classmates. On the eve of 1939 the girls wrote each other notes with New Year wishes. Zoya received the following note [...] "Zoya, don't judge people so strict. Don't take everything so close to heart. Know <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> egoist, flatterers, are insincere and you can't depend on them. You should leave their words without attention. Such is my New Year wish." [...] After reading the note Zoya said [...] "If one thinks of people like that, then what has one to live for?" ...|$|E

50|$|Jones {{discusses}} India's {{invention of}} a more efficient numeral system, including {{the invention of the}} concept of zero. He explains how the concept traveled west to the Caliphate. Then it arrived in Italy where it met fierce resistance. The reason for this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> familiar only with the Roman numerals and not the superior Indian numerals. Eventually, the Hindu-Arabic numerals displaced the Roman ones.|$|R
5000|$|Lichtenberg tackled {{these issues}} in depth and with complexity. She is on record as having {{believed}} at the time <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> incapable of accepting the ideas she proposes, because they were far too radical or ahead of their time. [...] Today, readers might see them as postmodern, {{or at least as}} bearing the seeds of critical race theory and critical cultural studies, or perhaps in terms of accommodation.|$|R

And then all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life and make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my {{enjoyment}} of anything when I am made to think <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> shut out from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Being a favourite, Mark {{of course}} became {{a man of}} power in the capital. This fact would have raised him a host of enemies {{had it not been for}} the {{kindness}} of his disposition and the urbanity of his manners. When a strapping powerful young fellow treats every one with respectful deference, keeps in the background, and neither by word nor look asserts himself, but, on the contrary, seems to entertain kindly thoughts about every one, it argues such an absence of selfishness <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> irresistibly attracted to him. Thus, unwittingly, he escaped jealousy and enmity in a palace where both were rife, and, holding in his hands as he did, the power to alleviate many of the [...] "ills that flesh is heir to," [...] he secured a good deal of warm friendship.|$|E

Have you ever really realised the startling fact that England is an island off the coast of Europe? that Europe is a peninsula at the end of Asia? that France, Germany, Italy, are the fringe of Russia? Have you ever really realised that the English-speaking race lives mostly in America? that the country is vastly more populous than London? that our class is the froth and the scum of society?

6000|$|But when I {{say that}} Conservatism is mainly due to want of imagination, I mean more than <b>that.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> wholly unable to {{conceive}} {{in their own}} minds any state of things {{very different from the}} one they have been born and brought up in. The picturing power is lacking. They can conceive the past, it is true, more or less vaguely--because they have always heard things once were so, and because the past is generally realisable still {{by the light of the}} relics it has bequeathed to the present. But they can't at all conceive the future. Imagination fails them. Innumerable difficulties crop up for them in the way of every proposed improvement. Before there was any County Council for London, such people thought municipal government for the metropolis an insoluble problem. Now that Home Rule quivers trembling in the balance, they think it would pass the wit of man to devise in the future a federal league for the component elements of the United Kingdom; in spite of the fact that the wit of man has already devised one for the States of the Union, for the Provinces of the Dominion, for the component Cantons of the Swiss Republic. To the unimaginative mind difficulties everywhere seem almost insuperable. It shrinks before trifles. [...] "Impossible!" [...] said Napoleon. [...] "There is no such word in my dictionary!" [...] He had been trained in the school of the French Revolution--which was not carried out by unimaginative pettifoggers.|$|E

The next step was a contemplated financial reform. However, Khrushchev stopped short of the real monetary reform, when he ordered to replace the old money with portraits of Stalin, and made a simple redenomination of the ruble 10:1 in 1961.|$|R
