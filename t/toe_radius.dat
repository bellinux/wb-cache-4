The thesis includes the analytical study pertaining to variation of undercut and the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius.</b> The theoretical part includes the concepts of fracture mechanics, different stages of the crack propagation and finally the results. The numerical results are obtained from FRANC 2 D/L. The results show that the fatigue strength of the welded structure depends on the parameters of the welds such as the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius,</b> weld angle, height of the undercut and plate thickness. The results show that the fatigue life can be improved by having the undercut as minimum as possible. However there has been significant variation on the fatigue life of the structure when the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> is increased...|$|E

The stress concentration factor was determined performing FEA of singlesided transverse attachment joints for mean value of weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> which was calculated by using several measurements of the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> along the weld length.

The dependance of theoretical stress concentration factors vs. weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> was determined by using both finite element analisys and photoelasicity method for various types of welded joints. Ratio of coresponding values of fatigue stress concentration factors of aswelded and improved joint, determined by using empirical formulas including also hardness in heat affected zone, gives magnitude of beneficial effects of mentioned weld improvement methods.

40|$|Welded joints {{are a major}} {{component}} that is often responsible for causing a structure failure or for being {{the point at which}} fatigue cracking initiates and propagates. Despite tremendous research efforts, the understanding of fatigue behaviour is still limited, particularly for new techniques like laser hybrid welding. Beside a comprehensive state-of-the-art study, the paper presents a fatigue study of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joint of stainless steel of 10 mm thickness, with 5 mm displacement. Motivation is to study the influence of the surface geometry shape on fatigue performance under a four point bending test. 13 samples were produced, measuring the <b>toe</b> <b>radii</b> and testing under constant amplitude loading with stress ratio R= 0. Different techniques have been used to measure local weld geometry, like plastic replica, a 3 D optical profiler and a 3 D-digitizer. The influence of the local weld geometry, like the <b>toe</b> <b>radii,</b> on the stress concentration was studied by FE-analysis. Occasionally lack of fusion was observed, which was taken into account in the FE-analysis. Based on the nominal stress approach, SN-curves were designed for laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. Macro hardness tests were carried out and the crack surfaces were observed in order to detect crack initiation and propagation. Correlations between the <b>toe</b> <b>radii,</b> the corresponding stress maxima and crack initiation locations were studied between the different samples and even along the welds.

40|$|In {{the context}} of linear elastic stress {{gradients}} that are present in welded joints, a stress field approach based on notch stress intensity factors is presented {{with the aim of}} describing stress distributions in the neighbourhood of weld toes, since fatigue strength is dependent on such distributions. This paper summarizes the analytical fundamentals and gives an appropriate definition of the parameters for stress components under opening and sliding modes. Then, by comparing the expected results with those obtained by numerical analysis, the contributions of the symmetric and skew-symmetric loading modes are quantified for different geometries, and summarized into concise expressions which also take into account the influence of the main geometrical parameters of the welded joint. The range of validity and the application limits of this held approach in the presence of weld <b>toe</b> <b>radii</b> are discussed. Finally, a synthesis of experimental fatigue strength data based on the new held parameters is reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{aspects of}} laser hybrid welding before, {{during and after}} the process differ from autonomous laser welding and from arc welding. When studying the fatigue behaviour of laser hybrid welded fillet joints we identified that the microgeometry, i. e. the surface ripples can be more critical than the macrogeometry of the weld surface and even than lack of fusion (LOF), which frequently was detected. The plastic replica method was applied to measure the <b>toe</b> <b>radii</b> at the weld edges while the topography was identified by interferometric profilometry. From metallurgical analysis of the joint interface the tendency to LOF can be explained. Stress analysis was carried out by FEA for the complex joint geometry and bending load situation, showing maximum stress on the weld toes, even when including LOF. It was shown that the position and value of the maximum stress depends on a non-trivial combination of the weld geometry, including possible LOF, and the surface topography. Thus it can be explained that at compressive stress conditions LOF does not contribute significantly to the fatigue strength of laser hybrid welds while the surface topography does. Recommendations for defining and in turn avoiding critical geometrical aspects during the welding process are discussed. Godkänd; 2009; 20091103 (minala...|$|R
40|$|In the Notch Stress Intensity Factor (N-SIF) {{approach}} the weld toe region is modelled as a sharp V-shaped corner and local stress distributions in planar {{problems can be}} expressed in closed form {{on the basis of}} the relevant mode I and mode II N-SIFs. Initially thought of as parameters suitable for quantifying only the crack initiation life, N-SIFs were shown able to predict also the total fatigue life, at least when a large part of the life is spent as in the propagation of small cracks in the highly stressed region close to the notch tip. While the assumption of a welded <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> equal to zero seems to be reasonable in many cases of practical interest, it is well known that some welding procedures are able to assure the presence of a mean value of the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> substantially different from zero. Under such conditions any N-SIF-based prediction is expected to underestimate the fatigue life. In order to investigate the degree of conservatism, a total of 128 fillet welded specimens are re-analysed in the present work by using an energy-based N-SIF approach. The local weld toe geometry, characterised by its angle and radius, has been measured with accuracy for the actual test series. The aim of the work is to determine if the N-SIF-based model is capable of taking into account the large variability of the toe angle, and to quantify the inaccuracy in the predictions due to the simplification of setting the <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> equal to zero...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} high {{frequency}} mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment procedure on the weld toe geometry and fatigue strength in 1300 MPa yield strength steel welds were investigated. In this regard first {{the effect of}} three or six run treatments on the weld toe geometry was evaluated. The fatigue strength and weld toe geometry of as-welded and HFMI treated samples was then compared. Fatigue testing was done under fully reversed, constant amplitude bending load. When {{increasing the number of}} treatment runs from three to six, the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> and width of treatment remained almost constant. However, a slightly smaller depth of treatment in the base metal and a somewhat larger depth of treatment in the weld metal was observed. HFMI treatment increased the fatigue strength by 26 %. The treatment did not increase the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> significantly, but resulted in a more uniform weld toe geometry along the weld. A depth of treatment in the base metal in the range of 0. 15 - 0. 19 mm and a width of treatment in the range of 2. 5 - 3 mm, were achieved. It is concluded that the three run treatment would be a more economical option than the six run treatment providing a similar or even more favourable geometry modification...|$|E

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{focuses on}} the fatigue {{cracking}} behaviour of laser and hybrid laser-MAG welded structures. Beside the welding process and the resulting weld, several topics related to fatigue of welded structures are treated such as; macro and micro surface geometry, weld defects and their influence on fatigue performance of welded structures, fatigue analysis by the nominal and effective notch stress method, fatigue life prediction using LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), fatigue testing, metallurgical analysis, elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analysis. The main objective is to gain understanding {{of the impact of}} weld defects and weld shape details on the fatigue behaviour of laser and hybrid laser welded joints. The first paper is a literature survey which compiled useful information regarding fracture and fatigue analysis of various welded joints. In the second paper fatigue testing by bending of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints was carried out. The weld surface geometry was measured and studied {{in order to understand the}} crack initiation mechanisms. The crack initiation location and the crack propagation path were studied and compared to Finite Element stress analysis, taking into account the surface macro- and micro-geometry. Based on the nominal stress approach, SN-curves were designed for laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. The competing criteria of throat depth and stress raising by the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radii</b> and by the surface ripples are explained, showing that surface ripples can be critical. The third paper is the continuation of the second paper, but studying the fatigue crack propagation of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. Microscopic analysis was carried out to identify internal weld defects. Nominal and effective notch stress analysis was carried out to compare standardized values. LEFM analysis was conducted for this joint geometry for four point bending load in order to study the effect of LOF on fatigue life. In good agreement between simulation and metallurgy, cracking starts and propagates from the lower toe, but for certain geometries alternatively from the weld bead or upper toe, even in case of Lack of Fusion, as was well be explained. Improved understanding of the crack propagation for these geometrical conditions was obtained and in turn illustrated. Lack of fusion surprisingly was not critical and only slightly lowered the fatigue life. Two dimensional linear elastic finite element analyses is carried out in the fourth paper on laser welding of a beamer in order to study the impact of geometrical aspects of the joint design and of the weld root on the fatigue performance. Critical geometrical aspects were classified and then studied by FE-analysis with respect to their impact on the fatigue behaviour. Stress comparison of full 15 mm and partial 6 mm weld penetration of the beam was done by varying the toe and root geometry to identify the critical details. Generalization of the knowledge by new methods was an important aspect, particularly to apply the findings for other joints. Together the papers provide better understanding of fatigue behaviour for complex geometries and are therefore suitable guidelines for improved weld design.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} fatigue life {{assessments}} of welded rectangular hollow sections made of steels and aluminium alloys, in a T-joint configuration, {{carried out by}} means of a local stress approach. The welded toe region is modelled like a sharp V-notch with an opening angle of 135 degrees and the intensity of the asymptotic stress distributions is quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). In order to carefully evaluate the NSIFs of hollow sections welded in a T-joint configuration, some Three-Dimensional (3 D) Finite Element (FE) analyses are firstly carried out. Afterwards, the NSIFs are used to evaluate the mean value of the strain energy density over a semicircular sector of radius R-c at the welded <b>toe.</b> The <b>radius</b> R-c is thought of as a material-dependent parameter. The experimental values of fatigue life are compared with those predicted by two previously scatter bands curves recently reported in the literature for welded joints made of structural steel and aluminium alloy. These curves were drawn by using mainly fatigue data obtained from cruciform and T-shaped welded joints. Although the analyses reported here represent only a first attempt to extend an energy-based approach to 3 D hollow section joints, the comparison shows that a quite satisfactory assessment of the fatigue life can also be obtained for this type of welded joints. The agreement is good for welded joints made of structural steel, whereas the predictions are found to be in the safe direction for welded joints made of aluminium...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new method, based on fracture mechanics analysis of fatigue, {{to calculate the}} generalized stress parameter proposed by Maddox. The generalized stress parameter is computed from the currently existing structural stress definition and the stress intensity factor (SIF) calculation. With the structural stress term accounting for the effect of global weldment geometry, the stress intensity factor captures the local effect of the weld profile, characterized by the weld angle and weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius.</b> Parametric equations for the stress intensity factor are used to obtain the generalized stress parameter. A series of detailed two-dimensional finite element analyses, combined with the weight function method, is employed to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} utilized parametric equations. The validity range of these parametric equations is also extended to a wider range, i. e., a larger <b>toe</b> <b>radius,</b> which is more typical for current welded structures in the automotive industry. Finally, the generalized stress parameter is validated with fatigue test results of various specimen types and thickness combinations. It is found that the generalized stress parameter can adequately predict the fatigue life of welded joints and can serve as a better fatigue damage parameter than the structural stress since the weld profile effect has been included...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} weld defects in laser {{processed}} materials (for laser welding, laser hybrid arc welding and laser cladding) and {{their effect on}} the fatigue life of components. Component properties were studied with particular emphasis on the macro and micro surface geometry, weld defects and clad defects. The influence of these defects on fatigue life was analyzed by; the nominal and effective notch stress method, fatigue life prediction using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), fatigue testing, metallurgical analysis, fractography, elastic and elastic-plastic Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A simplified Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was also carried out {{to better understand the}} formation of undercuts during the welding process. The main objective is to gain an understanding of the impact of laser weld and clad defects on the fatigue behaviour of components. In the first two papers, fatigue testing involving the bending of laser hybrid arc welded eccentric fillet joints was carried out. Based on measurements of the weld surface geometry the crack initiation location and the crack propagation path were studied, experimentally and in conjunction with FE stress analysis. The competing criteria of throat depth and stress raising by the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radii</b> and by the surface ripples are explained, showing that the topology of surface ripples can be critical to fatigue behaviour. LEFM analysis was conducted to study the effect of Lack of Fusion (LOF) on fatigue life. Cracking starts and propagates preferentially from the lower toe of the top surface for this eccentric weld, even in cases of LOF. In the third paper two-dimensional linear elastic FEA was carried out for laser welding of a high strength steel beam. The impact of the geometrical aspects of joint design and of the weld root geometry on the fatigue performance was studied. Critical geometrical aspects were classified and then studied by FE-analysis with respect to their impact on the fatigue behaviour. In the fourth paper the melt pool flow behaviour during the laser hybrid arc welding process was analyzed by CFD simulation. The melt velocity behind the keyhole was measured from high speed imaging as a starting value for the simulation. It was found that a high speed flow in the thin topmost layer of the melt transferred its momentum to an underlying flow which is faster than the welding speed and this delays the lifting of the depressed melt. In the fifth and sixth papers FEA of different macro stress fields and of stress raisers produced by defects was studied in laser clad surfaces for four different fatigue load conditions. Defects were categorized into zero-, one- and two-dimensional types. Pores intersecting or just beneath the surface initiated fatigue cracking, accompanied by two circular buckling patterns. For a four-point bending load involving a surface pore on a spherical rod, the critical range of azimuthal angle was identified to be  55 º. The performance of as-clad surfaces was found to be governed by the sharpness of surface notches. Planar defects like hot cracks or LOF are most critical if oriented vertically, transverse to the bar axis. A generalized theory was established, showing that the combination of the macro stress field with the defect type, position and orientation, determines whether it is the most critical stress raiser.

40|$|Abstract—The {{roll center}} {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} for designing a suspension. Several driving characteristics are affected significantly by the migration of the roll center during the suspension’s motion. The strut/SLA (strut/short-long-arm) suspension, which is widely used in production cars, combines the space-saving characteristics of a MacPherson strut suspension with some of the preferred handling characteristics of an SLA suspension. In this study, a front strut/SLA suspension is modeled by ADAMS/Car software. Kinematic roll analysis is then employed to investigate how the rolling characteristics change under the wheel travel and steering input. The related parameters, including the roll center height, roll camber gain, <b>toe</b> change, scrub <b>radius</b> and wheel track width change, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strut/SLA suspension clearly has a higher roll center than strut and SLA suspensions do. The variations in the roll center height under roll analysis are very different as the wheel travel displacement and steering angle are added. The results of the roll camber gain, scrub radius and wheel track width change are considered satisfactory. However, the toe change is too large and needs fine-tuning through a sensitivity analysis.

40|$|Weldments {{geometry}} with failures {{occurring at}} the weld toe {{or at the}} weld root cannot, by its nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as bead shape and <b>toe</b> or root <b>radius</b> vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. The worst case configuration {{can be achieved by}} modelling as a sharp, zero radius, notch both the toe and the weld root. The intensity of asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution is quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). For steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch, units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIFs used in LEFM. The different dimensionality of NSIFs for different notch opening angles does not allow a direct comparison of failures occurring at the weld toe or at the weld root. In order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, a simple scalar quantity, i. e. the value of the strain energy density (SED) averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tip, has been introduced. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I, II and III. The radius Rc of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes being equal to 0. 28 mm for welded joints made of steel. The local-energy based criterion is applied here to steel welded rollers produced by Rulmeca and subjected to prevailing mode I (with failures at the weld root).

In this master thesis, thetoe radius has been studied more carefully along with the selection of reliable measurementsystems which are able to measure the <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> along the weld. A computerized vision systemhas been evaluated by performing a measurement system analysis. FE-simulations anddestructive fatigue testing has also been carried out to determine which radial geometry beingcritical to the fatigue life. The {{results show that the}} currently used methods and gauges do not provide the requiredaccuracy when measuring the <b>toe</b> <b>radius.</b> The gauges are handled differently by differentoperators – even when using the vision system – which makes the methods subjective andtherefore unreliable. There are measuring systems that can gather surface data along the weldwith high accuracy, but there is no reliable method to assess the data. Therefore, the authors havedeveloped an algorithm – named STELIN – that assess the gathered surface data andautomatically identifies and calculates the <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> and the toe angle along the weld. Using thatinformation an opportunity to improve the process control when welding is possible. The performed FE-calculations show that the surface roughness in the weld toe probably has aninfluence at the fatigue life of the joint. A more precise separate study should be made todetermine the impact of the surface roughness on the fatigue life. Those results should serve as abase when reviewing the theory used when predicting the fatigue life. Currently, stress averagingapproach is used in the notches of the root and the weld toe. In the future though, there might beanother stress condition to be taken into account, if the goal of reducing weight of the finishedproduct shall be achieved. Regarding measuring the surface roughness in the weld toe, theevaluated vision system has enough accuracy to deliver reliable data. More work remains with the STELIN-algorithm. The method used when assessing the calculatedtoe radii should be based on the conclusions from the performed FE-calculations. Integrating theSTELIN-algorithm in a fast feedback measurement system – for instance, on a laser – willprobably provide good opportunities for a better process control in order to achieve higherfatigue life of the welded joint...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a strong demand for lighter {{vehicles}} in order to increase the pay load. Through this the specific fuel consumption is decreased, the amount of greenhouse gases is lowered and the transport economy improved. One possibility to optimize the weight is to make the components from high strength steels and join them by welding. Welding is the main joining method for fabrication of a large proportion of all engineering structures. Many components experience fatigue loading during all or part of their life time and welded connections are often the prime location of fatigue failure. Fatigue fracture in welded structures often initiates at the weld toe as aconsequence of large residual stresses and changes in geometry acting as stress concentrators. The objective of this research is to increase the understanding of the factors that control fatigue life in welded components made from very high strength steels with a yield strength of more than 800 MPa. In particular the influences of the local weld toe geometry (weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> and angle) and residual stress on fatigue life have been studied. Residual stresses have been varied by welding with conventional as well as Low Transformation Temperature (LTT) filler materials. The three non-destructive techniques Weld Impression Analysis (WIA), Laser Scanning Profiling (LSP) and Structured Light Projection (SLP) have been applied to evaluate the weld toe geometry. Results suggest that all three methods could be used successfully to measure the weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> and angle, but the obtained data are dependent on the evaluation procedure. WIA seems to be a suitable and economical choice when the aim is just finding the radius. However, SLP is a good method to fast obtain a threedimensional image of the weld profile, which also makes it more suitable for quality control in production. It was also found that the use of LTTconsumables increased fatigue life and that residual stress has a relatively larger influence than the weld toe geometry on fatigue strength of welded parts...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of extensive measurements on weld toe geometry of as-welded and TIG-dressed butt welded connections in high strength steels S 460, S 690 and very high strength steels S 890 and S 1100. Descriptions of the measurement techniques and data analysis are presented. Four weld toe parameters have been formulated to characterize the weld toe: weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius,</b> weld toe angle, weld height and undercut. From the data can be concluded that TIG-dressing, on average, has a beneficial effect on the geometry of the weld toe. However, TIG-dressed weld toes have different appearances and as a result, weld toe parameters show more variation after TIG-dressing. An improvement of the weakest link is therefore not guaranteed. The reheating of weld material and surrounding parent material results in a new fusion zone (FZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ). Hardness measurements have been performed in all different zones and show an increase of hardness as a result of TIG-dressing, with an occasional exception in the very high strength steels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of extensive measurements on weld toe geometry of as-welded and TIG-dressed butt welded connections in high strength steels S 460, S 690 and very high strength steels S 890 and S 1100. Descriptions of the measurement techniques and data analysis are presented. Four weld toe parameters have been formulated to characterize the weld toe: weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius,</b> weld toe angle, weld height and undercut. From the data can be concluded that TIG-dressing, on average, has a beneficial effect on the geometry of the weld toe. However, TIG-dressed weld toes have different appearances and as a result, weld toe parameters show more variation after TIG-dressing. An improvement of the weakest link is therefore not guaranteed. The reheating of weld material and surrounding parent material results in a new fusion zone (FZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design of complex welded structures subjected to fatigue loadings. In the last years it has been developed a new approach for predicting the high cycle fatigue behaviour of welded joints, based on the Notch-Stress Intensity Factors of the uncracked geometries, which have been successfully applied to welded joints of different geometries using an analytical frame in combination with stress data obtained from Finite Element Analyses. The approach is based on the observation that the very small weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> obtained by using traditional welding technologies is consistent with the assumption of a sharp V-notch geometry, characterised by an exponential stress field, which the fatigue strength depends on. Recently published Eurocodes suggest the use of a hot spot approach, both for steel and aluminium structures. Nevertheless the evaluation of fatigue strength of engineering complex structures remains a difficult and, in some way, controversial subject. We hope that this synthetic presentation of the N-SIF and hot spot approaches as compared to the European Standards could help to clarify the subject and to design better and more reliable structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue life}} {{prediction}} of welded joints based on S-N curves {{in conjunction with}} nominal stresses generally is not reliable. Stress distribution in welded area affected by geometrical inhomogeneity, irregular welded surface and weld <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> is quite complex, so the local (structural) stress concept is accepted in recent papers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine the stress distribution in plate type aluminum welded joints, to analyze the reliability of TSA (Thermal Stress Analysis) in this kind of investigations, and to obtain numerical values for stress concentration factors for practical use. Stress distribution in aluminum butt and fillet welded joints is determined by using the three different methods: strain gauges measurement, thermal stress analysis and FEM. Obtained results show good agreement- the TSA mutually confirmed the FEM model and stresses measured by strain gauges. According to obtained results, it may be stated that TSA, as a relatively new measurement technique may in the future become a standard tool for the experimental investigation of stress concentration and fatigue in welded joints that can help to develop more accurate numerical tools for fatigue life prediction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work is {{concerned}} with effect of material grade on fatigue strength of welded joints. Fatigue strength evaluation of welded joints in as welded and post weld treated condition was carried out with effective notch method. Results of peak stress method have also been {{compared with those of}} effective notch method for as welded joints. In addition, using the results of effective notch method, the effect of important weld and global geometry factors on notch stress concentration factor has been studied with 2 -level design of experiment and a mathematical relation among stress concentration factor and the geometric factors has been proposed. Overall, thickness of the base plate and <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> is found {{to be the most important}} factors determining fatigue strength of the joint. Welding induced residual stresses have also been predicted using 2 D and 3 D FEM analysis to see their effect on fatigue strength of the joints. Also, transversal residual stresses were measured using X-ray diffraction method to assess the accuracy of predicted results. Based on simulation results, effect of geometric factors on maximum value of transversal residual stress was also investigated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWeld seam is {{the weakest}} {{point of the}} structure. Weld defects, weld {{geometry}} such as <b>toe</b> <b>radius,</b> and residual stresses, which are typically tensile in the critical area, weaken the fatigue strength of the weld seam. These factors become more important with the welding of high strength steels (HSS) because structures containing welded seams loose the benefit from {{the strength of the}} steel. The weld seam fatigue strength can be improved locally with several different methods. In this paper residual stresses of the weld area and their modifications for improving the fatigue strength are discussed. The residual stresses of the toe area are changed from tensile up to compressive stresses, which are known to improve fatigue strength, with several methods. High tensile stresses can be relaxed mechanically or thermally as postweld heat treatment. Mechanical treatments are more common especially in large structures. Typical mechanical methods are burr grinding, TIG re- melting, hammer peening and needle peeing. A new method is laser re-melting method. All these methods also change the geometry of the weld toe by improving it. This paper concentrates to needle peening (high frequency mechanical impact, HFMI), and presents some results from laser re- melting tests. Both surface measurements and depth distributions of stress measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method are presented...|$|E
40|$|The Peak Stress Method (PSM) is a simplified, finite element-based {{technique}} to readily estimate the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs) {{at the tip}} of sharp-V-shaped notches. More precisely, it was shown that the maximum principal stress evaluated at the Vnotch tip by means of a rather coarse finite element analysis is proportional to the mode I NSIF, as far as mode II and mode III stresses are negligible. When fatigue strength assessment of fillet welded joints is performed according to the NSIF approach, the weld toe profile is modeled as a sharp V-notch having the <b>toe</b> <b>radius</b> equal to zero (the worst case hypothesis) and the peak stress can be used as design stress combined with a properly calibrated design scatter band. Due to its computational simplicity, the PSM appears rather useful for the everyday design practice of the shipbuilding industry. In the present paper the PSM is briefly described and applied to assess the fatigue strength of joints between HP stiffeners with fillet-welded cover plates adopted by the shipbuilding industry, for which full scale fatigue test data are available. By applying the PSM, good agreement between theoretical and experimental fatigue lives is obtained despite the complex geometry and the different loading conditions of the tests...|$|E
