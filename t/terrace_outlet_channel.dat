40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a physical model study of the Homme Dam spillway and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. The objectives of the study were to verify the adequacy of the proposed outlet-channel riprap protection, recommend and verify the adequacy of more economical riprap protection, and determine the spillway rating curve. The model study was conducted for the 8 t. Paul District of the Corps of Engineers (COE) at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota. The study used a 1 -to- 25 -scale model of a center section of the spillway and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel.</b> Two <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection designs were tested. The study showed that the proposed <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection (Design 1) withstood the probable maximum flood (PMF) without damage to the spillway structure and with only minor damage to the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. A more economical design of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection (Design 2) was proposed and tested; this design withstood the PMF without damage to the spillway and with only minor damage to the. <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> protection. The estimated cost savings of implementing Design 2, as compared to Design 1, is $ 206, 000. US Army Corps of Engineers; Barr Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to model if {{hydraulically}} suitable habitats for juvenile and spawning grayling could be created by morphological restoration alone in the Bjurfors Övre hydropower <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> in the Ume River Basin. The study was done by 2 D modelling with HEC-RAS using hourly water flow and level data collected during the period 20160521 - 20161029. Suitable water depth and velocity values for larvae and spawning grayling were collected from literature. Environmental measures for the Bjurfors Övre <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> were designed based on the morphology in <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> with documented reproducing grayling populations and large habitat diversities. The <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> at present morphology and after morphological modifications were modelled at different flow scenarios (0 - 369 m 3 /s) and areas of suitable water velocities and depths before and after proposed measures were compared. Results show that suitable velocity areas would increase with a factor of between 1, 03 - 1, 81 and the suitable depth areas with a factor of 2, 34 - 19, 09 and that suitable depths may be the major limiting factor in current conditions. Results also show that zero-flow events at Bjurfors Övre hydropower plant create unsuitable velocities for larvae and spawning grayling and that the frequency and duration of such events could be more limiting than the mere occurrence of such events. The study indicates that the morphological restoration in hydropeaking <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> could improve the availability of habitats with suitability water depth and velocity not only for larvae and spawning grayling, but for other lotic organisms. The study also showed that HEC-RAS modelling is a potential resource effective way to assess to what extent certain proposed environmental measures may create suitable water depths and velocities in hydropeaking <b>outlet</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After over 16 {{years of}} service at the inner walls of a steel {{absorber}} and <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> in wet FGD system, the rubber lining was subjected to examinations. A series of impedance spectra for the pre-vulcanized soft rubber lining based on chlorobutyl rubber (CIIR) were recorded. Rubber lining samples taken from the absorber bottom, which had {{been in contact with}} the washer sump solution, exhibited properties similar to those of new rubber lining samples not exposed to the corrosive environment. Rubber lining samples taken from the absorber upper part and from the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> showed significant damage, and so deterioration in their protective properties, in comparison with the new lining. Also the results of tensile strength and hardness tests carried out on rubber samples taken from various parts of the absorber and the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> are presented...|$|R

30|$|Outburst floods {{triggered}} by wave overtopping. When snow/ice/rock avalanches enter a glacial lake, {{the water level}} rises and the lake surface generates displacement waves; the superimposed surges submerge the moraine dam crest, extrude the unstable dam body, and the overflowing water initiates the breach of the moraine dam without incision of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel.</b> Rainstorms and glacier meltwater can also cause the water level to rise and the flow rate to increase (Kershaw et al. 2005). When {{the strength of the}} water that escapes from the lake and the incision of the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> exceed a certain threshold, glacial lake outburst occurs.|$|R

In general, the authors find the scaling exponent to increase from 0. 51 for square channels (r= 1) to 0. 93 for very wide channels (r> 100).

40|$|Lake Ähtärinjärvi, at the {{northern}} end of the River Kokemäenjoki watercourse in northern central Finland, has been known to have an older <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> across the modern Suo-menselkä watershed to the Bothnian Bay. The ancient connection over the watershed is in-dicated by the existence of a conspicuously deep and wide palaeochannel that runs from {{the northern}} end of Lake Ähtärinjärvi to the headwaters of the River Ähtävänjoki Radio-carbon datings of the basal sediments of the channel show that the fl ow in the old <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> ceased at about 1500 cal yr BP; the old channel therefore functioned as an out-let since the isolation of the lake at about 9900 cal yr BP to 1500 cal yr BP. Sedimentolog-ical studies of Lake Ouluvesi, located below the modern outlet of the lake system, suggest opening of the modern outlet at 3200 cal yr BP, indicating that the lake system had a 1700 -year period of bifurcation before the fi nal drying up of the old <b>outlet</b> <b>channel.</b> The recon-struction of the tilting of the lake level supports this pattern, and demonstrates further that during the early-Holocene the lake consisted of three basins located at different levels until the transgression caused by the tilting gradually brought the basins to the same level...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{special design}} method for three-dimensional {{design of the}} inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> of the turboprop engines. The method {{is based on the}} solution of indirect problem in internal aerodynamics, which is realised by mechanical construction of the flow field between inlet and outlet sections of the designed channel. The flow field is represented by number of flow tubes made of special plastic material, of optimised geometrical shape and their course in the space. The method was applied on the design of inlet channel of the three-shaft turboprop engine Walter M 602 and the aircraft L 610 and on the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel</b> of the two-shaft turboprop engine Walter M 601.

Instead, the advancing finger of oil partially and temporarily plugs the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel,</b> creating a pressure difference that builds up and is released when water from the side channels pushes {{the tip of the}} finger into the <b>outlet</b> <b>channel,</b> thereby facilitating the birth of the droplet by interfacial pinch-off that is primarily initiated by an extensional flow...|$|R
