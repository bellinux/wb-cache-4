5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} was originally described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the 1832 third volume of Iconografia della fauna italica per le quattro classi degli animali vertebrati. He named it <b>Trygon</b> violacea, from the Latin viola ("purple"), and designated two specimens collected off Italy as the species syntypes. The genus <b>Trygon</b> {{has since been}} synonymized with Dasyatis. In 1910, American zoologist Henry Weed Fowler placed the {{pelagic stingray}} in the newly created subgenus Pteroplatytrygon, from the Greek pteron ("fin"), platus ("broad"), and <b>trygon</b> ("stingray"). Later authors elevated Pteroplatytrygon {{to the rank of}} full genus, though some taxonomists dispute whether this species is distinct enough to warrant separation from Dasyatis.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by three American ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as <b>Trygon</b> brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Jordan and Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized the two in 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and <b>Trygon</b> were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar {{freshwater}} and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were tentatively identified with H. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. <b>Trygon</b> fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, {{additional research is needed}} to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of H. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.|$|E

The Biosub [...] generated its own electricity (using a bike),its own water, using the Air2Water Dragon Fly M18 system, its own air (using algae that produce O2). The algae were fed using the Cascade High School Advanced Biology Class Biocoil. The habitat shelf itself was constructed by <b>Trygons</b> Designs.|$|R
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray {{is known}} to inhabit several large rivers and associated estuaries in Indochina and Borneo. In Indochina, it occurs in the Mekong River to potentially as far upstream as Chiang Khong in Thailand, {{as well as in}} the Chao Phraya, Nan, Mae Klong, Bang Pakong, Prachin Buri and Tapi Rivers. In Borneo, this species is found in the Mahakam River in Kalimantan and the Kinabatangan and Buket Rivers in Sabah; it is reportedly common in the Kinabatangan River but infrequently caught. Though it has been reported from Sarawak as well, surveys within the past 25 years have not found it there. Elsewhere in the region, recent river surveys in Java have not recorded its presence, despite the island being the locality of the species holotype. Historical records from Myanmar, the Ganges River in India, and the Bay of Bengal (the latter two as <b>Trygon</b> fluviatilis) have similarly not been corroborated by any recent accounts.|$|E
25|$|German {{biologists}} Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle originally {{described the}} pale-edged stingray from seven syntypes, in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They named it <b>Trygon</b> zugei after zugu-ei, the Japanese {{name for this}} species. The genus <b>Trygon</b> was synonymized with Dasyatis by subsequent authors. Several early accounts of D. zugei were confounded by specimens of D. acutirostra; in 1988 Nishida and Nakaya published a study that resolved the differences between these two species and designated a new lectotype for D. zugei.|$|E
25|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri-Emilé Sauvage originally {{described the}} marbled whipray as <b>Trygon</b> oxyrhynchus {{based on a}} female specimen caught near Saigon, Vietnam, in an 1878 volume of the scientific journal Bulletin de la Société philomathique de Paris. In 1913, Samuel Garman synonymized this species with Himantura uarnak, a judgment that remained unquestioned in subsequent literature until Maurice Kottelat referenced the name in his 1984 review of Indochinese fishes. This species may also {{be referred to as}} the longnose marbled whipray or the marbled freshwater stingray.|$|E
500|$|Well-documented since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the common}} stingray {{was known as}} <b>trygon</b> (τρυγών) to the ancient Greeks and as pastinaca to the ancient Romans. An old common name for this species, used in Great Britain {{since at least the}} 18th century, is [...] "fire-flare" [...] or [...] "fiery-flare", which may refer to the reddish color of its meat.|$|E
500|$|The bluespotted ribbontail ray was {{originally}} described as Raja lymma by Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål, in his 1775 Descriptiones Animalium quae in itinere ad maris australis terras per annos 1772, 1773, et 1774 suscepto collegit, observavit, et delineavit Joannes Reinlioldus Forster, etc., curante Henrico Lichtenstein. The specific epithet lymma means [...] "dirt". Forsskål did not designate a type specimen. In 1837, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle created the genus Taeniura for <b>Trygon</b> ornatus, now {{known to be}} a junior synonym of this species.|$|E
500|$|Australian {{zoologist}} William John Macleay {{published the}} first scientific {{account of the}} mangrove whipray, {{a brief description of}} an immature female [...] long caught off Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, in an 1883 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He named it <b>Trygon</b> granulata, as he noted that the specimen's head and back were [...] "covered with small granules". In 1928, Gilbert Percy Whitley moved this species to the genus Himantura. It belongs to the uarnacoides species complex, along with H. chaophraya, H. hortlei, H. lobistoma, H. pastinacoides, and H. uarnacoides. Other common names for this ray include mangrove ray, whitetail whipray, and Macleay's coachwhip ray.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the short-tail stingray was made by Frederick Wollaston Hutton, Curator of the Otago Museum, from a female specimen [...] across caught off Dunedin in New Zealand. He published his account in an 1875 issue of the scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, in which he named the new species <b>Trygon</b> brevicaudata, derived from the Latin brevis ("short") and cauda ("tail"). Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the now-obsolete genus Bathytoshia, and then to Dasyatis. The short-tail stingray may also {{be referred to as}} giant black ray, giant stingray, New Zealand short-tail stingaree, Schreiners ray, short-tailed stingaree, shorttail black stingray, and smooth short-tailed stingray. It is closely related to the similar-looking but smaller pitted stingray (Dasyatis matsubarai) of the northwestern Pacific.|$|E
500|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the giant freshwater stingray was authored by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in an 1852 volume of the journal Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen. His account {{was based on a}} juvenile specimen [...] across, collected from Jakarta, Indonesia. Bleeker named the new species polylepis, from the Greek poly ("many") and lepis ("scales"), and assigned it to the genus <b>Trygon</b> (now a synonym of Dasyatis). However, in subsequent years Bleeker's description was largely overlooked, and in 1990 the giant freshwater stingray was described again by Supap Monkolprasit and Tyson Roberts in an issue of the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology. They gave it the name Himantura chaophraya, which came into widespread usage. In 2008, Peter Last and B. Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto confirmed that T. polylepis and H. chaophraya refer to the same species, and since Bleeker's name was published earlier, the scientific name of the giant freshwater stingray became Himantura polylepis. This species may also be called the giant freshwater whipray, giant stingray, or freshwater whipray.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{description of}} the red stingray was published by Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen under the name <b>Trygon</b> akajei, based on an earlier account of [...] "Pastinaca akajei" [...] by Heinrich Bürger. Subsequent authors have placed the genus <b>Trygon</b> in synonymy with Dasyatis. A lectotype for this species was designated by Marinus Boeseman in 1947. Other common names for the red stingray include brown stingray, estuary stingaree, Japanese red stingray, Japanese stingray, red skate, whip ray, whip stingray, and yellow stingray.|$|E

5000|$|British {{zoologist}} Albert Günther originally {{described the}} daisy stingray as <b>Trygon</b> margarita, in his 1870 Catalogue of the Fishes in the British Museum; subsequent authors synonymized the genus <b>Trygon</b> with Dasyatis. This species resembles, {{and is likely}} closely related to, the pearl stingray and the Niger stingray (D. garouaensis), both also native to West Africa. Numerous scientific accounts of the daisy stingray have been confounded by confusion with the pearl stingray; this confusion {{dates back to the}} two West African specimens referenced in Günther's original description. In 1984, Leonard Compagno and Tyson Roberts identified one of them as a pearl stingray and designated the other as the lectotype for this species. The specific epithet margarita is derived from the Latin for [...] "pearl", referring to the large tubercle on its back.|$|E
