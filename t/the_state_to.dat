5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>to</b> {{endeavour}} {{to secure}} to all citizens {{the right to}} work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>to</b> provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>to</b> work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

In 2017, the Sarawak government proposed a light rail system (Kuching Line) connecting Kuching, Samarahan and Serian divisions with anticipated completion in 2020.

5|$|A {{request by}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> dismiss {{the suit was}} denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard by the state Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 {{in favor of the}} Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
5|$|A {{segment of}} what is now SR11 was {{originally}} added to the state highway system in 1895 as a Blanchard Whatcom County line road. The highway became State Road6 in 1905 and was named Waterfront Road in 1907. The road was incorporated into the Pacific Highway in 1913 and U.S. Route99 (US99) in 1926. After an inland bypass was designated by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> become US99 in 1931, Chuckanut Drive became U.S. Route99 Alternate. During the 1964 highway renumbering, the road became SR11. In 1987, SR11 was realigned through Bellingham, shifting its northern terminus south to Fairhaven.|$|E

5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> take over the Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Although Connecticut {{is divided}} into counties, there is no county {{government}} in Connecticut and local government consists of cities and towns. County government was abolished in Connecticut in 1960, although the names remain for geographical purposes. Counties are, however, still used by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> organize its judicial and state marshal system. Connecticut's court jurisdictions still adhere to the county boundaries, except for Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven, which have been further subdivided into several jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|An {{expressway}} through Clare County {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Harrison to the east. The former route of US27 along M-61 and 1st Street/Clare Avenue in Harrison was designated Bus. US27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; {{the change was}} approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> reflect the new parent highway designation.|$|E

5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E
5|$|At Willsboro, Route22 {{heads to}} the {{northwest}} again, away from the lake, until it heads west and intersects US9 {{in the town of}} Chesterfield, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E

5|$|Booker's mayoralty and {{personal}} celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews.

Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under {{control of the state}} for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.|$|E

5|$|By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, {{and other}} {{organizations}} had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available for <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food {{from other parts of}} the region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>to</b> take over the property.
