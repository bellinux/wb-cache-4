5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components,</b> cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> of Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs {{and other such}} specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralised with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4, during which thorium precipitates as a hydroxide and is removed. The solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates, the oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing, and the oxides are dissolved in nitric acid. This last step excludes one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components,</b> cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E

5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>components</b> of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E

Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum {{is relatively easy to}} extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
