40|$|It {{has been}} known that some solar {{activity}} indicators show a double-peak feature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in sunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase of <b>the</b> sunspot cycle by examining the evolution of polar and low latitude coronal hole areas and the statistics of splitting and merging events of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C 3 in solar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the sunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable second maximum in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase of <b>the</b> cycle, in which low latitude coronal holes are dominant. The events of coronal hole splitting or merging, which are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase of <b>the</b> cycle. The far-reaching C 3 coronal mass ejections are also over-populated in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase of <b>the</b> cycle. From these results we suggest that solar dynamic activities due to the horizontal motions of magnetic fluxes extend far in <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> phase of <b>the</b> sunspot cycle...|$|R
