Knees were tested for 1500 flexion-extension cycles with 0 °- 70 °- 0 ° flexion and at cycles 0, 500, and 1500, knee laxity was {{measured}} under 90  N of anterior tibial force at 20 ° of flexion. Arnold et al. found that anterior laxity increased 1.3  mm after 500  cycles and 1.6  mm after 1500  cycles. Our testing of DIS showed an increase of 0.0  mm in 15 ° flexion and 1.4  mm in 30 ° flexion after 50 ’ 000  cycles.|$|E
40|$|Este estudo propõe observar as contradições e os efeitos da ideia de narrativa interativa no recorte do {{audiovisual}} e formas eletrônicas, compreendendo que este é um objeto heterogêneo e difuso, que passa por filmes, cibertextos e jogos eletrônicos, entre outros. Mas a oposição entre a narrativa e a interatividade na forma de um oxímoro não impede que superemos a paralisia dicotômica e observemos este encontro na teoria e na prática. Nele vislumbremos um quadro de tensões que pode ajudar a pensar as narrativas interativas como uma experiência paradigmática: um metaespaço de significação cercado por um círculo mágico de jogo, estrutura narrativa e sistema de interação. Nesse espaço, a experiência da narrativa interativa é marcada por forças de contração e de expansão que resultam em efeitos de escolha e controle, ilusão e simulação, ação e identidade. Na proposta metodológica do estudo, o quadro teórico se relaciona com o recorte prático que retorna às teorias, na forma de abdução. Primeiramente são opostos os temas da narrativa em Genette (1976), Chatman, (1993), Culler (1997) e Gerbase (2004), além dos processos de identificação no cinema em Aumont (1995), opostos aos conceitos da interatividade em Primo (1998; 2007), Rockwell, Bradley e Monger (1999), e Lemos (1997). A defesa e a crítica das narrativas interativas perpassam Crawford (2004), Aarseth (1997) e Cameron (2010). Buscamos uma direção para as oposições na teoria dos jogos em Caillois (1990), Huizinga (1955), Juul (2005; 2013), Salen e Zimmerman (2003), Bogost (2006), Koster (2010) e Sicart (2012). A ideia da experiência paradigmática se completa então com Jakobson (2003). Por fim, o quadro de tensões que é elaborado a partir da exploração teórica move-se para a narrativa interativa no âmbito da produção prática, a fim de perceber a movimentação dos conceitos em casos diversos, aplicando e expandindo o modelo teórico. Os principais produtos observados são: A Gruta (Filipe Gontijo, 2008), HBO Imagine (Biscuit Filmworks, 2009), The Sims 3 (Maxis, 2009), The Lost Experience (ABC, 2006), e Alan Wake (Remedy Entertainment/Microsoft Game Studios, 2010). As conclusões do estudo indicam que é possível superar a oposição radical entre narrativa e interatividade para compreender um movimento de contração e expansão entre o texto e o interator, em um sistema que cria uma experiência de liberdade controlada em que a narrativa é {{a performance}} de e com uma estrutura. This thesis proposes to observate the contradctions {{and effects of}} the idea of interactive narratives, focusing on audiovisual and electronic forms. We understand that this is an heterogenous and difuse object, that moves along films, cybertexts and electronic games, among others. But the opposition between narratives and interactivity {{in the form of an}} oxymoron should not stop us from going beyond the dicotomic paralysis and observating this junction on theory and practice. In in, we will see a board of tensions that may help thinking about interactive narratives as a paradigmatic experience: a metaspace that defines meaning and is surrounded by a magic circle of games, narrative structure and interactive systems. In this space, the interactive narrative experience is influenced by the forces of contraction and expansion that result in effects of choice, control, illusion, simulation, action and identity. As a method of study, our theoretic framework relates to the practical objects, which in turn relate back to the theory, as an abductive method. First, we oppose the themes of narrative as found in Genette (1976), Chatman, (1993), Culler (1997) and Gerbase (2004), as well as the processes of identity in the cinema as in Aumont (1995), opposing them to the concepts of interactivity in Primo (1998; 2007), Rockwell, Bradley e Monger (1999), and Lemos (1997). The critical defense and attack {{of the idea of}} interactive narratives are brought to the table with Crawford (2004), Aarseth (1997) and Cameron (2010). We then choose a direction among the oppositions by taking on game theory in Caillois (1990), Huizinga (1955), Juul (2005; 2013), Salen e Zimmerman (2003), Bogost (2006), Koster (2010) and Sicart (2012). The idea of a paradigmatic experience becomes complete, then, with the help of Jakobson (2003). At last, our <b>tension</b> <b>board</b> that came from theory moves along to the interactive narratives as found in the real, practical world, so that we can visualize the moving concepts in different cenarios, not only applying the theory but expanding it. Our main objects in this phase are A Gruta (Filipe Gontijo, 2008), HBO Imagine (Biscuit Filmworks, 2009), The Sims 3 (Maxis, 2009), The Lost Experience (ABC, 2006), and Alan Wake (Remedy Entertainment/Microsoft Game Studios, 2010). The conclusions of our thesis indicate that it it possible to go beyond the radical opposition between narratives and interactivity in order to understand a movement of contraction and expansion between the text and the interactor, within a system that creates an experience of controled freedom in which narrative is a performance of and with a structure...|$|E
50|$|Much {{energy was}} {{expended}} {{during this period}} on conflicts between Anglicans and nonconformists over education.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new theoretical {{framework for understanding}} the governance of co-operative and mutual organisations. The theoretical literature on the governance of co-operatives is relatively undeveloped in comparison with that on corporate governance. The paper briefly reviews {{some of the main}} theoretical perspectives on corporate governance and discusses how they can be usefully extended to throw light on the governance of co-operatives and mutuals. However, taken individually these different theories are rather one dimensional, only illuminating a particular aspect of the board's role. This has lead to calls for a new conceptual framework that can help integrate the insights of these different theories. The paper argues that a paradox perspective offers a promising way forward. Contrasting the different theoretical perspectives highlights some of the important paradoxes, ambiguities and <b>tensions</b> that <b>boards</b> face. ...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) {{underwent}} {{a radical change}} that transformed its mission, critical tasks, organizational structure and decision making processes. This research responds to {{a gap in the}} professional literature by examining this rare case of governmental agency transformation.; Political and organizational events converged over time to make the transformation of the CIWMB possible. These events provide historical context for the series of actions that occurred over an eighteen year period.; Three phases of the transformation are identified: Phase 1, the organization in a state of equilibrium; Phase 2, the punctuated equilibrium of the organization; and Phase 3, the transformation process.; Utilizing the grounded theory method and through structured and open-ended interviews of key participants eight themes are identified that occurred during the three phases of the transformation. These themes were: Industry-Oriented - "Old Board," Timing of the Change, Radical Mission Change, Key Policy Components of AB 939, Organization Structure, Administration, New Critical Tasks, Public Process and Dialogue. The historical record, legislative initiatives, budgets and personnel documents and periodicals corroborate the themes derived from the interviews.; This research into the transformation of the CIWMB provides an additional perspective on how a full-time board {{may be more likely to}} stay focused and committed to policy implementation as opposed to classical bureaucratic organizations where the initial excitement of new programs wanes and is replaced by mundane routines. The full-time board structure of the CIWMB created a different context where the bulk of the agency’s bureaucratic routines were left to the Executive Director. Secondly, CIWMB board members served limited fixed-term appointments and were appointed by diverse authorities (executive and legislative) which created a dynamic <b>tension</b> amongst <b>Board</b> members that sharpened the focus of the debates in the public arena over directions to policy priorities. Additionally, the board members were required to cast their policy votes publicly amidst the eyes and ears of observant stakeholders representing a wide array of interests. The constant involvement of these diverse stakeholders added to the dynamic <b>tension</b> of the <b>board</b> policy process and enhanced its probability of remaining actively committed and engaged...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use voting result of shareholder proposals as an indicator of the level of conflicts between board and minority shareholders. OLS regression and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests have been applied in the analysis. Findings – It was found that cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Also, the <b>tension</b> between <b>board</b> and minority shareholders is affected by both corporate governance factors and a company's stock performance. Research limitations/implications – In general, the research result indicates that cumulative voting is still an effective mechanism that can lower investors' costs on monitoring boards of directors. Practical implications – Considering the huge amount of resources used in shareholder campaigns, the research result indicates that cumulative voting can be an efficient choice to alleviate the confrontation between dissenting shareholders and board of directors. Social implications – With the change of minority shareholder structure, it is necessary to examine whether the corporate world needs to reconsider the adoption of cumulative voting. Originality/value – The authors use a novel proxy, voting results of investor proposals, to measure the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. This is also one of the few papers focusing on the monitoring cost side of the agency cost problem in corporate governance literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} decline of public transportation and rise of automobile use in the United States {{from the perspectives of}} social and environmental history. Through a case study of Detroit, the dissertation argues that World War II reinforced a culture of driving and set the stage for mass abandonment of public transportation in the post-war era. Even as wartime resource shortages exposed the vulnerabilities of car-centered societies, riders??? experiences on public transit and whites??? increasingly strong associations of streetcars and buses with black bodies worked against efforts to create long-term alternatives to private car use. Understanding the significance of World War II in shaping Americans??? mobility requires exploration of wartime transformations in everyday travel, as well as how government agencies and private corporations depicted these changes. The first part of this dissertation explores the effects of wartime resource shortages on Detroit???s public transit system. As buses and streetcars became extremely overcrowded, and service unreliable, racial <b>tensions</b> on <b>board</b> mounted. Public transit vehicles became common sites of racial conflicts. The second part of the dissertation examines automobility in the war and immediate postwar era. Government propaganda and private advertisements portrayed driving as fundamental to the American way of life and upheld the white male driver as a symbol of freedom for which the United States was fighting. At the same time, federal programs to limit rubber and gasoline use promoted driving as patriotic and essential to the war effort...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of the annual general meeting (AGM) in the {{mediation}} of <b>tensions</b> between the <b>board</b> of directors of a company and its shareholders. An evaluative framework is developed for assessing whether directors at any particular AGM appear to be making the meeting inclusive for the shareholders. Consideration is made at first of the place of the AGM as a corporate governance device, concluding that in recent times shareholder voting on resolutions and questioning of the board exhibit important features of self-governance as opposed to external regulation. A scoring system is then developed for assessing whether an AGM favours the company or the shareholders, using twelve criteria to rank them. The results of observations of 22 AGMs over recent years in five industrial sectors are then analysed and assessed, with reasons for high and low scores being suggested.

40|$|When Hewlett Packard (HP) {{announced}} in September 2006 that its Board Chairman, Patricia Dunn, had authorized HP’s security department {{to investigate a}} suspected Board-level press leak and that the investigation included tactics such as obtaining HP Board members’ and reporters’ telephone records through false pretenses (conduct known as “pretexting”), observers vehemently condemned the operation as illegal and outrageous. In congressional testimony, however, Dunn defended the investigation as “old fashioned detective work. ” Although Dunn would later claim that she was unaware of key aspects of the investigation, her description was not so far off. The police routinely rely on deception to investigate and apprehend wrongdoers. Although {{it is tempting to}} view HP’s pretexting episode as a one-time scandal, the episode illuminates a more important, largely unexplored, conflict between corporate policing and corporate governance. This Article analyzes the <b>tension</b> between the <b>board’s</b> competing responsibilities of overseeing its internal corporate police and implementing the norms and structures that presumably create ethical (and therefore “good”) corporate governance. As the HP scandal aptly demonstrates, law enforcement techniques that rely primarily on deception are likely to conflict with corporate governance norms such as trust and transparency. After outlining the problem, the Article considers its broader policy implications...|$|R
40|$|Aspen (Populus gradidentata) and {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda) flakes were {{prepared}} with tangential-grain and radial- grain faces on a laboratory disk flaker. These were gently dried in a steam-heated rotary drum dryer. Approximately 1 week after drying, surface wettability was {{measured on a}} large sample of flakes using an aqueous dye solution. Three replicate boards of each combination of flake species and face grain were then fabricated. Each of the three replicate boards was made with a different adhesive resin. The three adhesives were urea-formaldehyde, phenolic, and neat isocyanate. The procedure (wettability measurements and board fabrication) was repeated at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after flake preparation. Surface wettabilities were reduced as the flake surfaces aged. <b>Tension</b> strengths of <b>boards</b> perpendicular to their faces (internal bond strengths) were also reduced as flake surfaces aged, and reductions in internal bond strengths and surface wettabilities appear to be related. Bending proper- ties were, in general, not influenced by flake age. The ob- served reductions in internal bond strengths suggest that laboratory storage of flakes for much longer than 6 months {{is not a good}} practice. However, no conclusive statements can be drawn from this work concerning the influence of flake aging on board properties...|$|R
5000|$|As {{automobile}} production {{continued to}} be loss making for BMW, <b>tensions</b> mounted at <b>board</b> level. By 1956 there was agreement that the company needed to plug the gaping gap in its range with a mid-size model, but Grewenig was determined to avoid the mistakes {{that had been made}} with the 501, which had been launched on the basis of cost estimates that in retrospect appeared ludicrously optimistic. He accused colleagues for failing to provide convincing cost estimates for proposed new models, but at this stage no prototypes had been produced so that any costing of proposals was a somewhat theoretical exercise. In the end Hanns Grewenig resigned from BMW in 1957. By mutual agreement with the chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Karl von Mangoldt-Reiboldt, Grewenig's resignation took place six months ahead of the date previous scheduled. His successor in charge of the executive board, , would have a similarly challenging time {{at the top of the}} company, which culminated with an offer for BMW by Daimler-Benz. [...] The Daimler Benz ambitions for BMW were thwarted only at the eleventh hour through a massive cash investment by the industrialist Herbert Quandt, which saved the business and, as matters turned out, gave BMW a long term future.|$|R

The Vagabonds own two corps halls-one devoted to bingo and fundraising, and the other for rehearsals. In addition, the corps maintains a fleet of buses and trucks that at one time provided transportation to the Butler Community at large. The Vagabonds also never suffered the often rumored [...] "peanut-butter and jelly" [...] diets that some corps endured. The Vagabonds ate well, had excellent instruments, uniforms and rehearsal spaces thanks to the Board of Directors.|$|R
