5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem.

5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. <b>The</b> <b>traffic</b> contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>traffic</b> contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract {{so as to guarantee}} themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Using {{push-to-talk}} {{applications in}} ad hoc networks is not straightforward. There are no inherent mechanisms to support priority of <b>the</b> voice <b>traffic,</b> to avoid great jitter and packet loss in face of large background traffic loads. This paper presents three preemption mechanisms {{that can be}} applied to support push-to-talk traffic in multi-hop ad hoc networks. The mechanisms differ in the way <b>the</b> background <b>traffic</b> is treated: discard, buffering and inter-scheduling. It is shown that there is a trade-off between the impact on <b>the</b> background <b>traffic</b> and <b>the</b> service for <b>the</b> push-to-talk <b>traffic.</b> Discarding or buffering <b>the</b> background <b>traffic</b> leaves <b>the</b> push-to-talk <b>traffic</b> with very little impact by <b>the</b> background <b>traffic,</b> while inserting <b>the</b> low priority packets in the interval between the high priority packets incurs some cost to <b>the</b> push-to-talk <b>traffic.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Trafficking {{in human}} beings is a growing {{phenomenon}} with an expanding body of literature. However, a gap is evident in this body of literature: original research focusing on specific incidents of human trafficking.

5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. <b>The</b> <b>traffic</b> improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane. The widening of the road distanced the houses {{on the east side of}} Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass.

5|$|NY129 was {{designated}} in 1908 as {{a section of}} Route2, a legislative route designated by the New York State Legislature. However, in 1921, the route was realigned off the route that would become NY129 in favor of NY9A. Nine years later, the state designated the route as NY129 during the state highway renumbering. The route originally followed a route used by NY131 once the routes were swapped in the 1940s, with NY131 being decommissioned soon after. NY129 was extended to end at a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This lasted up to at least 1969, when the designation was truncated back to NY118, which was extended to <b>the</b> <b>traffic</b> circle instead. <b>The</b> <b>traffic</b> circle in Pines Bridge was removed by 1991.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to this result, <b>the</b> AF <b>traffic</b> class (see symbol ▴) is guaranteed only if enough resources for <b>the</b> EF <b>traffic</b> class are available. Therefore, during {{the interval between}} 625 and 875 s, {{it is possible to}} reach a goodput level which is higher compared to <b>the</b> EF <b>traffic</b> class. This is mainly because, once <b>the</b> EF <b>traffic</b> class is guaranteed only if there are remaining resources, <b>the</b> AF <b>traffic</b> class takes <b>the</b> second place in the provisioning of bandwidth guarantees. Although <b>the</b> AF <b>traffic</b> class requires more bandwidth assignment than <b>the</b> EF <b>traffic</b> class, using QoSatAr it is possible to keep the priority levels allowing <b>the</b> AF <b>traffic</b> class {{to take advantage of the}} remaining resources.
