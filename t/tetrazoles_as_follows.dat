Most approaches are aimed at devising inhibitors of cholinesterase, the enzyme that destroys ACh. A quite different tack involves developing compounds that have cholinergic activity in their own right. The tetrazole alvameline (8), for example, was developed as a bioisostere of the muscarinic cholinergic compound arecoline. The design devolves {{on the fact that}} the proton on a free tetrazole shows a (pKa) comparable to that of a carboxylic acid.

The instability of 2 -deoxy oligosaccharides and difficulty in controlling their stereoselectivity of coupling reactions is primarily {{due to the lack of}} a C- 2 substituent. This thesis introduces a new method of 2 -deoxy glycosylation. Condensation of 2 -deoxy sugars with 1 H-tetrazole and di-t-butylphosphoramidite produces N 2 and N 1 isomer of the tetrazole adduct. Glycosylations using either isomers as glycosyl donors were examined under different glycosylation conditions. Repetition of the coupling protocol enables the assembly of a trisaccharide model system of PI- 080.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{is one of}} a series of {{investigations}} dealing with the poten-tialities of different <b>tetrazoles</b> <b>as</b> a measure of cellular metabolism in intact tis-sues (4, 6). Several basically different preparations have been employed in the past, each with its own intrinsic advantages and limitations; (a) freehand slices of fresh tissue, (b) microtome sections of frozen tissue, and (c) homogenates. In the initial studies, an analysis was made of the tissue slice method, especially those factors associated with the wide range of variability in the extent and character of the deposition of reduced tetrazolium. It was hoped that the es-tablishment of objective data concerning the operation of specific biological and experimental contingencies would enhance both the scope and validity of the tetrazolium method. Two salts, neotetrazolium (NT) and 2, 3, 5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) were explored, using both histological and quantita-tive indices as the basis of their relative efficacy.

Title of Thesis: <b>Tetrazoles</b> <b>as</b> {{potential}} antituberculotics The {{development of}} new antituberculotics has recently become the subject of interest of many pharmaceutical companies. The disease's pharmacotherapy is very demanding on the health system as well as pacient compliance, neither of which are on a sufficient level in the developing countries. As a result, multiresistant strains evolve and those, becoming practically untreatable, pose a serious threat even to the western civilization. Many pharmaceutical laboratories including the KAOCH of FaF are searching for new and more effective agents. One of the contributions {{to the field of}} research is also this diploma thesis. The subject of the thesis was the synthesis of series of substituted 1 -aryl- 1 H-tetrazol- 5 -thioles and a combination of three antituberculotically promising structural elements, 1 -aryl- 1 H-tetrazole as a ground structure, an alkylated atom of sulfur connected to an electrondeficient carbon atom and an implementation of nitro groups.

Title of diploma thesis: Synthesis of <b>tetrazoles</b> <b>as</b> antituberculotics Although {{significant}} progress in therapy of tuberculosis has been made since effective drugs were discovered {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century, it is still widespread and refractory curable disease. The situation is complicated with growing appearance of resistant strains and for that reason it is necessary to search for new potential antituberculotics. The aim of this work was to continue with synthesis of antimycobacterial-efficient structures based on tetrazole. Firstly, we synthesised derivates of 1 -aryl- 5 -[(3, 5 -dinitrobenzyl) sulfanyl]- 1 H-tetrazole by the method of Williamson's synthesis, when the reaction of 1 -aryl- 1 H-tetrazol- 5 -thiol with 3, 5 -dinitrobenzylchloride was performed. Conditions of the reactions were further optimalised. We prepared by the same way derivates of 1 -fenyl- 5 -[(3, 4, 5 - trimethoxybenzyl) sulfanyl]- 1 H-tetrazole afterwards, as analogues of previous tetrazoles missing the electron withdrawing 3, 5 -dinitrosubstitution.

These two complexes have been fully characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Complex 1 crystallizes in a non-centrosymmetric space group Aba 2 in the orthorhombic system and is found to exhibit ferroelectric behavior, whereas complex 2 crystallizes in the P 2 (1) /c space group in the monoclinic system. Variable temperature magnetic characterizations in the temperature range of 2 - 300 K indicate that complex 1 is a canted antiferromagnet (weak ferromagnet) with T-c = 15. 9 K. Complex 1 represents a unique example of a multiferroic coordination polymer containing <b>tetrazole</b> <b>as</b> a co-ligand. Complex 2 is a one-dimensional chain of Mn(II) bridged by a well-known antiferromagnetic coupler end-to-end azido ligand.

The allyl group was removed in two steps by isomerization to a vinyl ether and hydrolysis with N-bromosuccinimide in aqueous tetrahydrofuran. A new method for {{the conversion of the}} 1, 2 -diacylglycerols to phosphatidylcholines under acid-catalyzed conditions was developed. The diacylglycerols were treated with (2 -bromoethyl) -($ 2 $-cyanoethyl) -(N,N-diisopropylamino) -phosphoramidite 51 in the presence of <b>tetrazole</b> <b>as</b> catalyst, the phosphite triester was oxidized, and the neutral phosphate triester was treated with trimethylamine to simultaneously deprotect the phosphate and convert the bromoethyl substituent to the choline function. A modification was introduced to extend the synthetic strategy to unsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The starting material was 3 -(4 -methoxybenzyl) -sn-glycerol 30 (3 -PMB-sn-glycerol). Diacylation of the hydroxyls with 13 -tetradecynoic acid 64 a followed by Glaser oxidation gave 1, 2 -(13, 15 -octacosadiyn- 1 - 28 -dioyl) - 3 -PMB-sn-glycerol 66.
