5|$|Joel Enterprises of Richmond {{was listed}} as one of Vick's larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a {{contract}} with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel's cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.|$|E

50|$|Of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trials</b> he {{presided over}} the one which {{probably}} aroused the most interest was the Yelverton case, one of several cases heard {{in a number of}} countries where Major Yelverton, hoping to make a wealthy marriage, tried to rid himself of the inconvenience of his existing marriage to Miss Longworth. In Ireland initially he failed, as the lady's legal team convinced the jury that the marriage was valid (their verdict was reversed on appeal).|$|R
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
500|$|Jury {{selection}} for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> began on February 15, 1989.

500|$|After Buller [...] {{received}} a letter from Wontners confirming that civil action was taking place, he consulted the Judge Advocate General, who informed him that no military enquiry should take place while such a case was proceeding. Lewis then tried to persuade the Guards' Club, of which Gordon-Cumming was a member, to carry out an enquiry into the events, which would have negated much of the need for a trial. A vote of the members rejected the possibility, and <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> remained the outcome. The prince was furious with the Guards, and wrote to Ponsonby that [...] "The decision of the Guards Club is a terrible blow to the Scots Guards; and I feel most deeply for the officers who have the honour of their regiment so much at heart." ...|$|E

50|$|The Tichborne Case: Cockburn {{presided over}} <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> {{case in which}} Arthur Orton {{attempted}} to establish his identity as the missing baronet Sir Roger Tichborne. This trial collapsed after 103 days, <b>the</b> longest <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> on record.

500|$|On November 23, Judge Rothman {{accepted}} Feldman's {{motion and}} set March 21, 1994, as the start date for <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial.</b> Rothman ordered Jackson's deposition scheduled {{before the end}} of January 1994, but noted he might reconsider if Jackson was indicted on criminal charges. Jackson agreed to be deposed on January 18. [...] His attorneys said he was eager to testify, but also said they might oppose the deposition if criminal charges were filed or were still under consideration on his deposition date. [...] They said if charges were filed, they would want the criminal trial to go first. However, when authorities notified Jackson's lawyers that they expected their investigation to continue at least through February, Jackson's team still failed to win a delay of the civil case. Jackson's lawyers also lost a motion to prevent Feldman from turning over information (e.g. from the civil deposition) to prosecutors pursuing possible criminal charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerns}} about a civil trial during an ongoing criminal investigation, {{and about the}} prosecutor's access to the plaintiff's information in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial,</b> stemmed from Jackson's Fifth Amendment rights. As two grand juries had deemed there was insufficient evidence for charges as of January 1, the prosecution {{might have been able}} to form the elements of a criminal case around the defense strategy in the civil trial; creating a situation akin to double jeopardy. For instance, prosecutor Tom Sneddon altered fundamental elements of his case in 2004 after evidence undermining the Arvizo family's 2003 allegations appeared after Jackson's initial arraignment. Upon discovery of two taped interviews in which the Arvizo family praised Jackson and denied any abuse, Sneddon introduced a conspiracy charge and claimed they were forced to lie against their will. And when Jackson was re-arraigned in April 2004 for the conspiracy charge, the dates of the alleged molestation on the charge sheet had been shifted by almost two weeks. Jackson's lawyer, Mark Geragos, had announced on NBC in January 2004 that his client had a [...] "concrete, iron-clad alibi" [...] for the dates on the charge sheet.|$|E
500|$|Susanna Hutchinson {{was baptized}} in Alford, Lincolnshire on 15 November 1633. She was the {{youngest}} child of William and Anne Hutchinson to accompany her parents on the voyage from England to New England in 1634. [...] She was the couple's 14th child, of whom 11 survived {{to make the trip}} to the New World; a 15th child was born in New England. [...] The family settled in Boston and lived across the street from magistrate John Winthrop, who was a judge during <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>trial</b> in 1637 that led to her mother's banishment from the Massachusetts colony. [...] While Hutchinson was still very young, her mother hosted popular religious discussions at their home. [...] Her mother's religious views were at odds with the orthodoxy of the Puritan ministers; she helped to create a major division in the Boston church and an untenable situation for the colony's leaders. [...] The family was forced to leave Massachusetts; they settled with many of her mother's supporters on Rhode Island in the Narragansett Bay, establishing the settlement of Portsmouth which soon became a part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. [...] Susanna was less than five years old when the family left Boston, and she was about eight when her father died in Portsmouth.|$|E

[...] During his testimony, Valencia {{stated that he}} had been given a set of facts by Miguel Noe and was to testify to these facts in exchange for US$20,000 once the claim was confirmed. [...] Noe had left for Mexico following the Court of Land Claims ruling and was not expected to return. [...] Reavis was found guilty on June 30, 1896.

40|$|<b>THE</b> <b>CIVIL</b> JURY <b>trial</b> is fast {{disappearing from}} our legal landscape, and one {{important}} reason for its disappearance is {{the rapid growth of}} mandatory arbitration. Yet, the imposition of mandatory arbitration eliminates <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> jury, and often this elimination is not made through a knowing, voluntary, or intelligent waiver. As I have argued elsewhere in greater detail, unless federal courts are generally willing to abandon the Seventh Amendment 2 ̆ 2 knowing/voluntary/intelligent 2 ̆ 2 <b>civil</b> jury <b>trial</b> waiver standard, they need to significantly revise their approach to mandatory arbitration clauses. If a given state allows <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> jury <b>trial</b> right to be waived through a contract of adhesion, even if the waiver is not knowing, voluntary, or intelligent, then that same standard should be applied to arbitration clauses. To the extent that the particular jurisdiction applies some version of the 2 ̆ 2 knowing, voluntary, intelligent 2 ̆ 2 test to determine whether the jury trial right has been waived, then that precise test should be applied to the arbitration clause. Companies 2 ̆ 7 imposition of mandatory arbitration against consumers, employees, and others now threatens the jury trial right to the extent that courts fail to apply the traditional jury trial waiver to mandatory arbitration provisions...|$|R
