5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth were {{achieved}} in-camera, with several notable exceptions. The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. <b>The</b> <b>owl</b> head maquette had to be rescued from a skip (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the third}} game between <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> and <b>the</b> Gators.

5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland <b>owls</b> such as <b>the</b> little <b>owl</b> and <b>the</b> long-eared <b>owl</b> cannot usually co-exist with <b>the</b> stronger tawny <b>owls,</b> {{which may}} take them as food items, and {{are found in}} different habitats; in Ireland the absence of <b>the</b> tawny <b>owl</b> allowed <b>the</b> long-eared <b>owl</b> to become <b>the</b> dominant <b>owl.</b> Similarly, where <b>the</b> tawny <b>owl</b> has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|R
5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side of the carriage looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and {{the lights in the}} compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
5|$|Bordering to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.|$|E
5|$|Like most owls, {{the barn}} owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in {{complete}} darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and {{can sometimes be}} seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, on various Pacific Islands and perhaps elsewhere, it sometimes hunts by day. This practice may depend on whether <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> is mobbed by other birds if it emerges in daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as magpies, rooks and black-headed gulls, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed.|$|E
40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{misconceptions about}} <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> Club, located at 378 N. Main Street in Tucson, Arizona. Many of these are the result of the {{popularity}} of the bachelors who formed Tucson's first men's club, <b>The</b> <b>Owls,</b> in <b>the</b> late nineteenth century. The restoration/renovation of the building in 1986 facilitated a revival of popular notions that <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> Club served as a clubhouse for the gregarious society of men. However, by examining the building in its appropriate context of "Tucson Boosterism," different conclusions are drawn. Although the residence is connected with members of <b>The</b> <b>Owls,</b> <b>the</b> buildings construction after the organization's social and group emphasis had ended. Instead, research revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> Club was designed as a single-family residence to promote the development of an elite Anglo neighborhood in Tucson while, simultaneously, reinforcing its patrons' position in society...|$|R
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> {{were riding}} high on {{emotions}} after their Week 1 victory over conference foe Middle Tennessee, {{it could not}} continue into Stillwater. <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> struggled to get into any type of rhythm throughout the game, scoring only two field goals {{in the first half}} and adding nothing to their score in the second. The offense could only garner 28 net yards on the ground and 175 yards in the air throughout the game. Defensively, <b>the</b> <b>Owls</b> did not repeat their performance from the previous week, either. <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> surrendered 233 net yards to the Cowboys on the ground.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> got March off to {{a losing}} start by losing 1 - 0 at home to Rotherham United.

The following week saw <b>the</b> <b>owls</b> take on Charlton Athletic at home; they won the game 3 - 0 with all goals being scored in the second half. The month ended with <b>The</b> <b>Owls</b> 6th in <b>the</b> table - three points clear of Cardiff City.|$|R
5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and <b>the</b> <b>owl</b> has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E
5|$|Scootie Randall {{returned}} to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's Talor Battle, who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20–11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35–33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat {{out the rest of}} the game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team led by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62–61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took the ball to the hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended <b>the</b> <b>Owl</b> lead to 64–61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernandez. Fernandez was double-teamed and was forced to take an off-balance 18-footer. The ball fell through the hoop with four seconds remaining, and Temple Owls won 66–64. Fernandez and Moore finished with 23 points, a season high for Fernandez.|$|E
