5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} of touring and working with {{producer}} Ross Robinson, Machine Head released its third studio album, The Burning Red, on August 10, 1999. The band added new elements to its music, including rapping vocals, a move which some believe to {{have been influenced by}} Ahrue Luster himself. This album and the band's change in image/musical direction (nu metal/alternative metal) was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of [...] "selling out". Nevertheless, McClain stated they weren't trying to sound like popular bands but [...] "wanted to sound different". Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was [...] "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past". The Burning Red became Machine Head's top selling album for a number of years, and debuted at number 88 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{positively}} {{reviewed the}} film as [...] "the 50th animated feature from Disney, and its look and spirit convey a modified, updated but nonetheless sincere and unmistakable quality of old-fashioned Disneyness." [...] Time film critic Richard Corliss wrote that Tangled [...] "wades into the DreamWorks style of sitcom gags and anachronistic sass," [...] while praising the film for achieving [...] "the complex mix of romance, comedy, adventure and heart that defines the best Disney features." [...] Corliss included Tangled at 19 in a list of top 25 All-time Best Animated films. Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times awarded the film four stars out of five; he described {{the film as}} a [...] "gorgeous computer-animated look that features rich landscapes and characters that look fuller and more lifelike <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past." [...] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media gave the film five out of five stars, writing, [...] "Fantastic princess adventure is fun, with great messages." [...] Gael Cooper of NBC News expressed that Tangled {{may be the best}} Disney film of all time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{season was}} first {{announced}} on February 1, 2007. That same day, {{it was confirmed that}} Arnold Shapiro had {{stepped down as}} producer, opting instead to appear as the executive consultant. On the decision, Shaprio stated he was [...] "gratified that (he and Allison) were able to successfully ‘re-invent’ BB2 and turn the series into an annual summer hit." [...] Grodner later stated [...] "We consider ‘All-Stars’ sort of the end of an era, and now we’re getting a chance to start once again with a fresh cast and new twists." [...] Rich Meehan replaced Shapiro as the executive producer. Casting for the season concluded on May 5, 2007. Grodner later promised fans of the series that Big Brother 8 would be more interactive, commenting [...] "It's not just about sitting down and watching television [...] We're a summer event that's always with you. I don't think any other show has that sort of reach." [...] Ghen Maynard of CBS later stated [...] "This year, {{there are going to be}} some new things that make the show even more ubiquitous and interactive [...] there will be something die-hard fans will love. It will give them the opportunity to participate even more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past." [...] Shortly before the premiere, a cast list began circulating the internet; casting director Robyn Kass, however, denied that this was the real cast. The cast was revealed on June 28, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|St Lo's {{support for}} the Orangists secured his career, and he {{remained}} in command of Portsmouth after the revolution. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, but while in the English Channel in August 1689, Portsmouth was attacked by the 58-gun French ship Marquis, and was captured. St Lo was severely injured in the seven-hour-long engagement, and was taken prisoner. The French took him to Brest, and then to Nantes, as a prisoner of war. St Lo spent the next two years a prisoner, a period he later claimed cost him £500 in expenses. He was paid £100 from the royal bounty, and his wife made a petition for him to be exchanged on 11 January 1691. His time spent in Brest and Nantes was put to good use in observing the French naval system, and in 1693 he published the pamphlet England's Safety, or a Bridle to the French King, based on his observations. Impressed by the speed of French naval preparations, he wrote that [...] "while [...] was at Brest, I was astonished by the expedition used by the French in manning and fitting out their ships, which, till then, I thought could be done no where sooner than in England, where we have ten times the shipping, and consequently ten times more seamen <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> France. But there I saw twenty sail of ships, of about sixty guns each, got ready in twenty days time: they were brought in, and the men discharged; and upon an order from Paris they were careened, keeled up, rigged, victualled, manned, and out again in the said time, with the greatest ease imaginable. I likewise saw one ship, of one hundred guns, had all her guns taken out there in four or five hours time, which I never saw done in England in twenty-four hours, and this with great ease and less hazard." ...|$|E

They see that, in England, the ministers and parliament manage everything; and that the king--although his influence goes for a good deal, and he can change his ministers as often as he likes--must yet bow to the voice of parliament. I think that that is reasonable; {{but when it comes to}} a parliament composed largely of mere agitators and spouters, I, for my part, would rather be ruled by a king." ...|$|E

6000|$|A handsome, mild, {{middle-aged woman}} {{appeared}} beside the stormy young thing, {{and said in}} the voice which Ludlow had already heard, [...] "Well, Cornelia!" [...] She seemed to make more account than the girl made of the young fellow's looks. He was of the medium height for a man, {{but he was so}} slight that he seemed of lower stature, and he eked out an effect of distinction by brushing his little moustache up sharply at the corners in a fashion he had learned in France, and by wearing a little black dot of an imperial. His brow was habitually darkened by a careworn frown, which came from deep and anxious thinking about the principles and the practice of art. He was very well dressed, and he carried himself with a sort of worldly splendor which did not intimidate the lady before him. In the country women have no more apprehension of men who are young and stylish and good-looking <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the city; they rather like them to be so, and meet them with confidence in any casual encounter.|$|E

"So I {{gave her}} the Bayéte, though who she might be I did not know, since I {{did not think it}} wise to stay to ask her if it were hers of right, {{although}} I should have liked to do so.

I tell you, little Yellow Dog, that they do not know what love can be. There is more love for him in my eyes alone <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> all that makes them fair. Say it to the Lord Macumazana that, as I know well, he goes down to battle and that the Lady Mameena will be with him in the battle as, though he saw her not, she has been with him in other battles, and will be with him till the River of Time has run {{over the edge of the}} world and is lost beyond the sun. Let him remember this when Jana rushes on and death is very near to him to-day, and let him look--for then perchance he shall see me. Begone now, Yellow Dog, to the heels of your master, and play your part well in the battle, for of what you do or leave undone you shall give account to me. Say that Mameena sends her greetings to the Lord Macumazana and that she adds this, that when the Old Man and the White ones told you that Love is the secret blood of the worlds which makes them to be they did not lie. Love reigns and I, Mameena, am its priestess, and the heart of Macumazana is my holy house.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the most}} {{recently}} established {{of our local}} representative institutions, the Boards of Guardians, the justices of peace of the district sit ex officio along with the elected members, in number limited by law {{to a third of}} the whole. In the peculiar constitution of English society, I have no doubt of the beneficial effect of this provision. It secures the presence in these bodies of a more educated class than it would perhaps be practicable to attract thither on any other terms; and while the limitation in number of the ex officio members precludes them from acquiring predominance by mere numerical strength, they, as a virtual representation of another class, having sometimes a different interest from the rest, are a check upon the class interests of the farmers or petty shopkeepers who form the bulk of the elected guardians. A similar commendation can not be given to the constitution of the only provincial boards we possess, the Quarter Sessions, consisting of the justices of peace alone, on whom, over and above their judicial duties, {{some of the most important}} parts of the administrative business of the country depend for their performance. The mode of formation of these bodies is most anomalous, they being neither elected, nor, in any proper sense of the term, nominated, but holding their important functions, like the feudal lords to whom they succeeded, virtually by right of their acres; the appointment vested in the crown (or, speaking practically, in one of themselves, the lord lieutenant) being made use of only as a means of excluding any one who it is thought would do discredit to the body, or, now and then, one who is on the wrong side in politics. The institution is the most aristocratic in principle which now remains in England; far more so than the House of Lords, for it grants public money and disposes of important public interests, not in conjunction with a popular assembly, but alone. It is clung to with proportionate tenacity by our aristocratic classes, but is obviously at variance with all the principles which are the foundation of representative government. In a County Board there is not the same justification as in Boards of Guardians for even an admixture of ex officio with elected members, since the business of a county being on a sufficiently large scale to be an object of interest and attraction to country gentlemen, they would have no more difficulty in getting themselves elected to the Board <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> being returned to Parliament as county members.|$|E
