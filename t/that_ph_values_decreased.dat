The wood flour was conditioned to different initial MCs and heated for 24 h at a constant temperature of 120 ºC in either oxygen or nitrogen atmosphere. The <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> and chromaticity indexes were examined. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis (DRUV) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were used to characterize the changes of chromophores upon heating. The study demonstrated <b>that</b> the <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> <b>decreased</b> after heat treatment, and it was lower when the heat treated was in oxygen than in nitrogen. The L* decreased significantly, while a* and b* increased. The total color difference ΔE* increased with increasing initial MC until a plateau was reached after 30 % MC. The color change was greater in oxygen than in nitrogen. The hydroxyl groups decreased after heat treatment. The releases of acid and formation of quinoid compounds and carboxylic groups during heat treatment were confirmed. Discoloration of wood is due mainly to the condensation and oxidation reactions, which are accelerated by oxygen.

40|$|This {{report is}} written in Swedish {{and focus on the}} Port of Gothenburg’s and the trade {{association}} Ports of Sweden’s views on future handling of scrubber generated wastes. This report has been fulfilled because of the new rules from IMO, concerning maximum sulphur content in the marine fuels, which will come into force in SECA during 2015. Many of the petroleum based marine fuels contain high levels of sulphur that can be harmful for both human and the environment. e. g. acidification and secondary particulate matter. Acidification means <b>that</b> the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> <b>decreases</b> in soils and lakes, which affect the ecosystem. Secondary particulate matter can cause human health issues such as early death. IMO MARPOL Annex VI was introduces in 1997 and revised in 2008 with amendments that entered into force in 2010. Annex VI contains the permissible limits of sulphur in marine fuels and emission into the air. Due to the revision of Annex VI in 2008 the European commission presented a proposal of amendment of the sulphur directive. The revised Annex VI from 2008 and the proposal of amendment states that all equivalent substitutes for low sulphur fuel that can provide the same positive environment impact is allowed to be used in SECA. One of the substitutes recommended by European Union is the use of an exhaust gas cleaning technology, i. e. scrubber. There are different types of scrubbers; wet and dry. To reduce the sulphur dioxide from the exhaust the wet scrubber uses either untreated seawater in an open system or caustic soda treated freshwater in a closed system. The open system is dependent on the oceans alkalinity. A closed system can be used in all kinds of waters, however, waste are generated and has to be taking care of in port. A dry scrubber uses pellets and generates a solid waste that also has to be handled in port. A semi-structured interview with the Port of Gothenburg and Ports of Sweden has been performed to fulfil the purpose of the report. The conclusion of the report is that the Port of Gothenburg, the industry and employers' organization Ports of Sweden believes that they have the possibility to receive waste from scrubbers. However, today they have not made any investigations to support this statement. Also both organizations have incomplete knowledge concerning the current amount of waste generated by using different scrubbers and the characteristics of the waste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 31 P nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor changes of cytoplasmic and vacuolar <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> in leaf tissues from young pea plants which had been grown in hydroponic culture with either nitrate or ammonium salts as sources of nitrogen. When acid stress was applied {{by the addition of}} 15 % CO 2 to air (5. 1 mM CO 2 in solution), cytoplasmic <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> <b>decreased</b> fast by 0. 5 pH units and then increased slowly without reaching the initial pH, while vacuolar <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> <b>decreased</b> by 0. 1 pH units. Under anaerobic conditions, the cytoplasmic pH decreased by one pH unit and the vacuolar pH increased by almost 0. 4 pH units. These changes were rapidly reversed when CO 2 was removed from air or, after anaerobiosis, by aeration. However, with mannose present during and after anaerobiosis, aeration failed to bring <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> back to the levels observed before anaerobiosis. Simultaneously, mannose phosphates accumulated and cytoplasmic phosphate disappeared. Since loss of phosphate decreases ATP levels, the observations suggest that ATP-dependent pumping of protons into the vacuole restored the cytoplasmic pH partially during acidification by CO 2 and fully after anaerobiosis. Photosynthesis was initially inhibited by high CO 2 and then restored indicating that protons are exported not only across the tonoplast into the vacuole but also across the chloroplast envelope into the cytosol. No large differences in pH regulation were observed in leaves of pea plants which were grown with either nitrate or ammonium salts. Apparently, retarded growth of ammonium-fertilized plants cannot be attributed to ineffective pH regulation...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{influence}} of <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> on the antibacterial action of subtilin A {{has been demonstrated}} by survivor counts, inhibition of respiration, and pH gradient plates. Staphylococcus aureus is more sensitive to subtilin as the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> increases; Eschmichia coli is more sensitive as the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> <b>decreases.</b> The results are analogous to those obtained by other investigators working with cationic detergents, and {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that the basic surface-active antibiotics kill bacteria by the same general mechanism as do the quaternary ammonium germicides. A sur-vey of the growth inhibition of other organisms on pH gradient plates indicates that Bacillus cereus behaves like S. aureus, while B. wgaterium, Corpebactem'um poin-settiae, and Streptococcus faecalis behave like E. coli. A pH/rnobility curve for subtilin A, obtained by paper electrophoretic studies, indicates no striking changes in the charge of the molecule over the pH range 4 ~ 9, although the presence of at least one free a-amino group is indicated by inflexion points in the range of pH 6 - 7. The isoelectric point of subtilin A at ionic strength 0. 1 is approximately 6 - 7. The use of sectored, square-shaped Petri dishes for pH-gradient plate studies with germicides is described. The effect of <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> on the germicidal action of cationic detergents is complex: some organisms, including Staphylococcus aurm, are more suscep-tible as the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> increases, others, including Escherichiu coli, are more sensitive as the <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> <b>decreases</b> (Salton, 1950). No explanation has been offered to account for this behaviour. Since the discovery by Dubos & Hotch-kiss (1942) that tyrocidine shares many of the antibacterial properties of the cationic detergents, a number of surface-active polypeptide antibiotics have been shown to belong to this group of germicides (Newton, 1953; Anderson...|$|R

Uniform CdS thin films were obtained when pH= 11. 6. There are obvious diffraction peaks at 26. 04 ° when pH is 11. 6. The transmittance increases as the <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> increase. The experiment show <b>that</b> <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> {{play a vital role}} in the properties of the CdS thin films...|$|R
40|$|Abtract. Strains of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (At. f) were {{separated}} and purified from water sample collected from a hot spring and bioleaching a low grade phosphate ore. The {{results indicated that}} bioleaching phosphorus rate increasing sharply was starting at the ending of <b>pH</b> <b>value</b> <b>decreasing,</b> and ascend velocity had slowed down after linear regression of pH was at its second peak. In the environment of ultraviolet mutagenesis, the initial growth of At. f (r) was decreased by illumination time increased, but the maximum rate of bioleaching phosphate ore (ηm) was increased. In the condition of ultrasonic vibration, r was increased by vibration time added, and ηm was almost increased, except 20 min, owing to the modificatory coefficient was large enough. In circumstances of low temperature treatment, r was decreased by treatment time raised; ηm was more increase than the sample of un-treatment (CK) ...|$|R
40|$|Electrolysis {{was shown}} to play a {{significant}} role in electromembrane extraction (EME) performance. Alkaline acceptors, prepared as 1 – 10 mM CsOH solutions, suffered from electrolytic reactions during EMEs of substituted phenols and their <b>pH</b> <b>values</b> <b>decreased</b> by more than 8 units after 40 min of EMEs at 50 V. As a consequence, serious deterioration of EME performance was observed for weak and medium-strong acidic phenols due to their compromised ionization and their subsequent back-extraction into organic phase and donor solution. Application of acceptor solutions consisting of high concentrations of weak bases (e. g. 500 mM ethanolamine) ensured similar initial pH conditions as for the alkali-metal hydroxide based solutions, moreover, significantly better tolerance to electrolysis-induced effects was obtained. Stable pH of acceptor solutions was achieved as well as an improved EME performance for all analytes over the entire extraction period...|$|R
