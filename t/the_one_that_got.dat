5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} Black and Blue, Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E

However, he has had small roles {{in a number of}} high-profile American films like The Three Musketeers and Alien 3. His role in Alien 3 was originally larger, but much of it was edited out of the final print. The cut footage {{can be seen in the}} extended version of the film.|$|E

This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films.|$|E

25|$|Sato's {{next move}} is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> {{him the most}} media {{attention}} as he signed with the World Wrestling Federation {{for the first time}} in his career. In early 1990 Sato along with former rival Pat Tanaka were introduced to the WWF as The Orient Express by manager Mr. Fuji. During this run, Sato introduced the Sitout Powerbomb to mainstream American wrestling for the first time. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud because Mr. Fuji managed both teams. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express took on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom’s massive size advantage.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Quatermass and the Pit finally entered {{production}} Val Guest was occupied on Casino Royale (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) {{and he was}} best known for <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away (1957) and A Night to Remember (1958). Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963–64), The Saint (1962–69) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as A Night to Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as A Night to Remember and <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism {{it needed to be}} convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was [...] "taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it." [...] He was also impressed with Hammer Films’ lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he {{was surprised to find that}} Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as “Roy Ward Baker”, having previously been credited as “Roy Baker”. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.|$|E

500|$|After {{training}} {{under his}} father, and his uncle the luchador known as [...] "El Gallo Giro", {{he made his}} debut as [...] "Kahoz Jr.", {{as a tribute to}} his father's final wrestling character. From 1988 until 1993 he wrestled as Kahoz Jr. for various promotions in Mexico. His father, however, urged him to change gimmicks to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> his father the most fame [...] "Astro Rey Jr.". As Astro Rey Jr. or simply [...] "Astro Jr." [...] he travelled the world and wrestled extensively in Mexico and Japan. On March 22, 1999 Astro Rey Jr. won the Mexican National Welterweight Championship from Arkangel de la Muerte and defended it several times during his 19-month reign. Astro Rey Jr. finally lost the title to Karloff Lagarde Jr. on October 23, 2000.|$|E
500|$|Rumors had {{surfaced}} {{during the}} 1996 season that manager Terry Collins {{did not get}} along well with Bagwell and Biggio, largely contributing to his dismissal. [...] The Astros hired team color commentator Larry Dierker after the season to replace him. [...] According to his autobiography, This Ain't Brain Surgery, Dierker was asked during the interview how he would handle the players. [...] His response: [...] "'Look, I'm tired of this Bagwell and Biggio s---,' I said. 'Bagwell and Biggio {{will not be a}} problem, believe me.' [...] I now believe that this statement is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>got</b> me the job." [...] The Astros won division titles in four of five seasons with Dierker as manager; however, in each instance, they did not advance past {{the first round of the}} playoffs, and 2001 was Dierker's last season as the club's manager.|$|E
500|$|According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, {{the public}} fascination with war films became an [...] "obsession", with over 200 war films {{produced}} in each {{decade of the}} 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s. [...] Its popularity in the United Kingdom was {{brought on by the}} critical and commercial success of [...] Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an [...] "exclusively British [...] ", it failed to break into the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955-58 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By {{the end of the decade}} the [...] " [...] sense of shared achievement" [...] which had been common in war films [...] "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.|$|E

Michael Bauer, who had originally played DeMille, replaced Benzali as Max, a role he played {{until the end of}} the London run (and subsequently on the UK tour and in the BBC concert).

His stories were included in two annual anthologies of short fiction, Edward O'Brien's The Best American Short Stories and the O. Henry Prize Stories, in 1930, 1931, and 1932. In all, he published some twenty stories; four of them were vignettes that were to be included in his first novel.|$|E

I tell you that 'are was like runnin' through the drops in a thunder-shower. He got chased by the British ships pretty consid'able, but he was too spry for 'em.
