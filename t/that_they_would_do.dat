With Alec Bedser having to miss {{the first half of}} the season through pneumonia, Gibson had more opportunities. In 14 matches he took 37 wickets at 19.75. He also made his first fifty with the bat.|$|E

He hoped that the curia would {{deal with the issue}} for the situation was headed for a famine. When the curia did nothing, he spoke to the city's leading citizens, trying to persuade them to take action. Thinking <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the job, he turned his attention to religious matters.|$|E
25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} gone to war to defend Finland, there was no way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it for Norway.|$|E

A Google {{executive}} promised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{their best to}} avoid security concerns. However, on June 20, 2011, Street View was blocked in Bangalore due to security concerns from the police in Bangalore. Google officials and leaders from BJP, the ruling party in Karnataka, organized a meeting on July 19, 2011, to continue Street View in Bangalore.

25|$|Mansell's {{return to}} Williams was not straightforward. He {{would agree to}} return only if a list of demands were met, {{including}} undisputed number one status over Riccardo Patrese (who had also been his teammate in 1988), guarantees of support {{in a wide variety}} of areas with each guarantee in writing, and assurances from suppliers such as Renault and Elf <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> everything necessary to help him win. Frank Williams said the demands were 'impossible'; Mansell concluded that if that were the case he would be happy to retire. Three weeks later the impossible had happened and Mansell was a Williams driver.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his high}} profile, Furtwängler's public {{opposition}} prompted a mixed reaction from the Nazi leadership. Heinrich Himmler wished to send Furtwängler to a concentration camp. Goebbels and Göring ordered their administration to listen to Furtwängler's requests and {{to give him the}} impression <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what he asked. This led him to believe that he had some positive influence to stop the racial policy. He subsequently invited several Jewish and anti-fascist artists (such as Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Schnabel, and Pablo Casals) to perform as soloists in his 1933/34 season, but they refused to come to Nazi Germany. Furtwängler subsequently invited Jewish musicians from his orchestra such as Szymon Goldberg to play as soloists.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{official}} results were published shortly after midnight 28 December {{and it was}} clear the two candidates to face in a runoff would be Josipović and Bandić all the major candidates gave their speeches. Josipović called for voters to vote for the light, not for the dark, while Bandić insulted Josipović saying he was a pawn of Zoran Milanović and nothing more than his remote-control. The following morning the official campaign for the second round began. Josipović denied being an SDP project calling himself independent and accusing Bandić of being a remote-control of Ivo Sanader, referring among other things to claims by Dragan Primorac that Bandić was the favorite of the former prime minister. Bandić denied the rumors, however the following day the media published a story claiming that Bandić and Sanader had a secret lunch that very day in a Zagreb restaurant. Bandić denied the rumors calling the journalists who published the story liars, saying the media's favorite is Josipović and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> anything to discredit him.|$|E

500|$|Pheidippides' run to Sparta {{to bring}} aid has other legends {{associated}} with it. Herodotus mentions that Pheidippides was visited by the god Pan {{on his way}} to Sparta (or perhaps on his return journey). Pan asked why the Athenians did not honor him and the awed Pheidippides promised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so from then on. The god apparently felt that the promise would be kept, so he appeared in battle and at the crucial moment he instilled the Persians with his own brand of fear, the mindless, frenzied fear that bore his name: [...] "panic". After the battle, a sacred precinct was established for Pan in a grotto on the north slope of the Acropolis, and a sacrifice was annually offered.|$|E
500|$|Philip {{was known}} to be in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts that winter, and New Englanders accused Andros of {{sheltering}} him. [...] Historian John Fiske suggests that Philip's purpose was not to draw the Iroquois into the conflict, but instead to draw the Mahicans into the conflict with a view toward attacking Albany. [...] An offer by Andros to send New York troops into Massachusetts to attack Philip was rebuffed, {{based on the idea that}} it was covert ploy to again assert authority to the Connecticut River. [...] Instead, Mohawks from the Albany area did battle with Philip, driving him eastward. [...] When Connecticut authorities later appealed to Andros for assistance, Andros replied that it was [...] "strange" [...] <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so, considering their previous behavior, and refused to help.|$|E
500|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. In addition, Spee sought to counter British press reports that attempted to minimize their losses and exaggerate German casualties. A reception followed at the German Club of Valparaiso, though Spee insisted that the event be restrained in tone. He received a bouquet of flowers to celebrate the victory at Coronel; Spee replied <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> nicely for his grave. He stated that, ...|$|E

50|$|However, the MPA took {{no legal}} action at that time, only warning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> begin <b>doing</b> so in 2006.

500|$|In 1865, Olympia brewer Isaac Wood {{imported}} some hop roots {{from the}} United Kingdom, hopeful <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{well in the}} Pacific Northwest. As hops, used to flavor beer, were not then grown locally, the cost of transport from Britain or New York made his beer expensive, and he hoped Puget Sound-area farmers would grow hops and supply him. [...] He {{was a friend of}} Jacob Meeker, and gave him the roots to grow. Jacob passed some of them on to Ezra. The plants grew extremely well, {{and at the end of}} the season, the Meekers earned $185 from selling Wood the crop. Such a sum was rarely seen in the Puyallup Valley at that time, and a hop-growing boom promptly began. Ezra Meeker, with his head start, was able to repeatedly expand operations, he eventually had [...] of hop-growing lands. He also built one of the first hop-drying kilns in the valley. For years Meeker supplied Portland brewer Henry Weinhard.|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
500|$|Martínez {{contacted}} Garza, {{who knew}} two hitmen from Matamoros who could {{carry out the}} job. Cisneros then gave Martínez photo of Fischer, who {{passed it on to}} Garza. Garza contacted Israel Olivarez Cepeda and Heriberto [...] "Eddie" [...] Puentes Pizaña to carry out the murder. Garza had met them in Brownsville at Olivarez' uncle's house. During the last week of January, Garza met them again at a restaurant in Grand Prairie, Texas while he was working with Cuellar and Moya. Garza told Olivarez that there was a woman in Brownsville willing to pay someone to kill Fischer. Olivarez said he was interested in the job and stayed in contact with Garza. Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña were part of a cross-border drug trafficking and car theft ring that stretched from Mexico to Chicago. This organization was headed by Cuellar, the same man whose bond application was investigated by the Brownsville police after the business card was discovered at Fischer's house. Garza met the two again in Dallas on February 14 to describe the murder plans. They were given Fischer's photo, a map with the address, and promised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as they had been told on their next trip to Brownsville. On March 2, the night before the murder, Garza was traveling from San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to San Antonio and bumped into the two at a motel in Brownsville. Olivarez asserted that he was ready to carry out the plan.|$|E

500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E
