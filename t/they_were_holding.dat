5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>holding</b> council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too much water, which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E

25|$|The {{final stages}} of warfare were {{initiated}} in October 1945 when, {{in accordance with the}} terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they relinquished to Indonesians in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican pemuda in Pekalongan (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican pemuda out of Bandung in West Java and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>holding.</b> Five hundred Japanese and 2000 Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some of the}} Penal Laws restricting Catholic {{access to}} landed {{property}} were repealed between 1778 and 1782 this did not end anti-Catholic agitation and violence. Catholic competition with Protestants in County Armagh for leases intensified, driving up prices and provoking resentment of Anglicans and Protestants alike. Then in 1793, the Roman Catholic Relief Act enfranchised forty shilling freeholders in the counties, thus increasing the political value of Catholic tenants to landlords. In addition, Catholics began to enter the linen weaving trade, thus depressing Protestant wage rates. From the 1780s the Protestant Peep O'Day Boys grouping began attacking Catholic homes and smashing their looms. In addition, the Peep O'Day Boys disarmed Catholics of any weapons <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>holding.</b> A Catholic group called the Defenders was formed {{in response to these}} attacks. This climaxed in the Battle of the Diamond on 21 September 1795 outside the small village of Loughgall between Peep O' Day boys and the Defenders. Roughly 30 Catholic Defenders, but none of the better armed Peep O'Day Boys were killed in the fight. Hundreds of Catholic homes and at least one Church were burnt out {{in the aftermath of the}} skirmish. After the battle Daniel Winter, James Wilson and James Sloan changed the name of the Peep O' Day Boys to the Orange Order devoted to maintaining the Protestant ascendency.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism in {{the reign of}} David I {{had a profound impact}} on the development of Scots law, establishing feudal land tenure over many parts of the south and east, which eventually spread northward. Sheriffs—originally appointed by the King as royal administrators and tax collectors—developed legal functions, and as early as 1214, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>holding</b> court to hear a variety of cases. Feudal lords were also normally permitted to hold court where disputes between their tenants, including criminal matters, were adjudicated. By the fourteenth century, some of these feudal courts had developed into [...] "petty kingdoms" [...] where the King's courts did not have authority, except for cases of treason. Burghs, towns which had been given this special status usually by the King, also had their own set of local laws dealing mostly with commercial and trade matters and may have become similar in function to sheriff's courts.|$|E
