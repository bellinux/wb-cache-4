At the same time, Duke Svatopluk of Bohemia, who also {{supported}} Álmos, made an incursion into the regions {{north of the}} Danube. Coloman's ally BoleslawIII invaded Bohemia, forcing the Czech duke to withdraw. The emperor's attempt to take Pressburg was a <b>total</b> <b>failure,</b> but he persuaded Coloman to forgive Álmos, who was {{allowed to return to}} Hungary.|$|E
5|$|By August {{the plan}} was already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} of stores and wages slowed work at the Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in <b>total</b> <b>failure,</b> as the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E

40|$|Background: The intracytoplasmic sperm {{injection}} procedure {{ending with}} <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> is very distressfull event for both the clinician and the patient. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify independent factors which could be used to identify <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> before the day of {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}}. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 232 patients who were admitted to a tertiary-care hospital IVF Unit and showed <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> during intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles. To sort out the interwined effects of female age, basal FSH, sperm quality, antral follicle count, starting dose of gonadotrophine, sperm extraction technique, cycle length, > 14 mm follicle number, oocyte number after oocyte pick up, estradiol and progesterone level on the day of hCG and the MI, MII and GV oocyte number on the fertilization, multiple logistic regression analysis was used. Results: The <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> rate was 6 % and the recurrance rate was 23 %. The original model illustrated that the presence of GV oocytes, total oocyte number less than six, < 2000 pg/mL E 2 concentration on the day of hCG and testicular sperm extraction increases the <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> risk. Conclusion: It is very difficult to predict <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure.</b> Sometimes even with one good quality oocyte and sperm and in the case of globozoospermia fertilization can be achieved. Not only azoospermia but also low oocyte numbers increase the chance of <b>total</b> fertilization <b>failure</b> even after intracytoplasmic sperm injectio...|$|R
5|$|The French {{attempt to}} invade Ireland had ended in <b>total</b> <b>failure.</b> With the {{exception}} of a handful of prisoners of war, not one French soldier had successfully landed in Ireland, despite some ships remaining off the coast for almost two weeks. Twelve ships had been lost and over two thousand soldiers and sailors drowned. The invasion was abandoned, Hoche and his remaining men were returned to the army for service in Germany, and the general died nine months later from natural causes. The French Navy, although criticised for failing to land the expeditionary force, was also praised for successfully reaching Ireland and returning without encountering {{the main body of the}} British fleet. This achievement encouraged further invasion attempts, including a landing at Fishguard in Wales in February 1797 and a second invasion of Ireland in mid-1798.|$|E
5|$|With {{domestic}} opposition largely neutralised, {{the king}} {{turned his attention}} to Scotland. A major campaign was organised in August, but the effort ended in <b>total</b> <b>failure</b> when the English were routed by the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322. Edward II himself had to flee the battlefield to avoid capture, and Edmund was with him as the royal army retreated to York. The king's inability to handle the Scottish situation was becoming apparent. Andrew Harclay, who had defeated Lancaster at Boroughbridge, and for this had been created Earl of Carlisle and appointed Warden of the Marches to Scotland, signed a peace treaty with the Scots without royal sanction in January 1323. When the king found out, he ordered Harclay's arrest. Edmund was one of the judges who passed judgement on Harclay, who was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason. With Harclay gone, Edmund was given responsibilities for the defence of the northern border, but the situation remained untenable. On 30 May 1323, Edmund was on the council that agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.|$|E

Penile dimensions did not influence slippage, but penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{screening}} {{programs that}} have attempted to preclude soldiers exhibiting personality traits thought to predispose them to CSR have been a <b>total</b> <b>failure.</b> Part of this failure stems from the inability to base CSR morbidity on {{of one or two}} personality traits.

In addition, studies conducted following WWII screening programs showed that psychological disorders present during military training did not accurately predict stress disorders during combat.|$|E
