All of this was of little concern to TVR director and financier Fred Thomas, as he had apparently intended to close TVR and use the failure as a <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> to benefit his own engineering firm. In actuality, the directors decided on 30 October that the company would be dissolved and re-formed as Layton Sports Cars Ltd. When the new company began trading in December 1958, the directors voted to immediately inject £15,000 to expand the workforce and build stocks of car components. In February 1959, a sister company was formed under the name Grantura Engineering Ltd. to avoid incurring the UK's Purchase Tax on sales of the cars (which were then still being offered as kits); Purchase Tax would not be applied to kit cars that were purchased from a different company than that which supplied the mechanical components.|$|E

40|$|In the {{economic}} analysis of fiscal policies the elasticity of business capital {{with respect to}} changes in its user cost is of central interest. As a major component, the user cost of capital includes a firm’s marginal tax rate, which for some firms can deviate strongly from the statutory tax rate due to the asymmetric treatment of <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> and profits. In previous studies <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> and loss carry-over have either been roughly approximated by accounting losses or, most of the time, fully been ignored. Disregarding taxable status of a firm, however, does not only result in a loss in efficiency but also leads to persistent measurement error in the firm-specific marginal tax rate and user cost of capital. This invalidates its lagged values as instrumental variables, {{as they have been}} used in previous research, and does not solve attenuation bias. We use a novel firm-level panel data set including official corporate income tax returns to overcome these problems.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{structuring}} categorical-conceptual apparatus of the of the <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> phenomenon in the state budgetary resources, namely clarification of the concepts of “tax gap”, “tax expenditures”, “tax losses”, {{as well as the}} quantification of <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine. Methodology. Most modern scholars interpret the tax gaps as the amount of taxes that were not received with the budget as a result of shadow economy, tax evasion and the existence of tax debt. However, considerable asymmetry of the tax component of the state budgetary resources also arises due to budget losses of all levels as a result of providing tax exemptions. In modern economic literature such losses are considered as tax expenditures. We consider <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> a generalizing concept including potential amounts of tax revenues that the state and local budgets have not received {{as a result of the}} existence of the phenomenon of “tax gaps” and “tax expenditures”, and the amount of losses of the state budgetary resources in terms of their tax component is equal to the sum total of tax exemptions provided, unsettled tax debt of economic agents and the <b>loss</b> of <b>tax</b> revenue due to the operation of shadow economy. The study is based on the analysis of <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> of budgetary resources of Ukraine during the period of time from 2004 to 2014. The results of the study showed enormous losses of budgetary resources in Ukraine due to the imperfection of the tax system, spread of undisclosed operations, tax evasion, and inefficient fiscal policy implementation. The Consolidated budget loses the amounts of monetary funds, equal to an average of 53. 30 % of actual revenue over the period studied. Total <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> of the state budgetary resources in 2014 are equivalent to the total actual expenditures of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine on social protection and social security, defense, public order, security and judicial authorities. Even taking into account the point of view of foreign economists that only 1 / 3 of the tax gap can be converted into actual tax revenues in case of implementing measures of legalization of the economy, additional budgetary resources of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine obtained due to the elimination of tax gaps would be significant. It was determined that the effective management of tax gaps and tax expenditures and, consequently, a decrease in <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> of budgetary resources will ensure the correction of fiscal asymmetries and imbalances, will contribute to achieving fiscal equilibrium, will cause a synchronization of fiscal and monetary policy, and as a result, will reduce the need of Ukraine in loan financing and its debt bondage. Practical implications. Justification of the conclusion that the major reserves to increase the tax component of budgetary resources of the state with preventing <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> lie exactly in the plane of fiscal policy optimization and legalization of assets of business entities, allows to develop areas of improvement tax forms of financing public spending.
