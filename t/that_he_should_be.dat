5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon Snow House Mormont's ancestral Valyrian steel sword Longclaw, {{which was}} {{originally}} meant {{for his son}} Ser Jorah before Jorah's exile, {{as a reward for}} saving his life from the undead ranger. Jon is upset, however, when Sam tells him about Robb's war against the Lannisters, feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> there to help Robb.|$|E
5|$|Sella confessed his doping to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) {{and named}} {{teammate}} Matteo Priamo, also a stage winner in this Giro, as his supplier. Though Priamo never {{tested positive for}} anything, and though the Italian National Anti-Doping tribunal originally exonerated him, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled, upon appeal by CONI, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> suspended for four years.|$|E

5|$|At a {{drive-in}} restaurant, Vinnie and Crazy {{make out}} with their girls. When Roz spots a car that she thinks Boogaloo is in, Crazy is quick to drive off after it. Crazy ends up shooting two of the black gang members in an alley, much to Vinnie's shock. Solly investigates {{the death of the}} two black gang members. He questions Boogaloo, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> looking for the Stompers.|$|E
5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, a Florida {{judge ordered}} Jack to stop selling nude {{photographs}} of Runnels. Runnels filed suit, accusing Jack of making libelous comments {{about her and}} requested that a court ban him from distributing sexually-explicit photographs of her. Jack said that he took the photos, that they belonged to him and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free to pass them on to whoever he pleases. A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|The median is {{the halfway}} point, {{which means that}} 50% of people will die before eight months, but the other half will live longer, {{potentially}} much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in the favorable half of the upper statistical range. After an experimental treatment of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, Gould made a full recovery, and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing for}} Liechtenstein against England in a 2004 European Championships {{qualifying}} match at Old Trafford in 2003, Burgmeier was spotted by Max Houghton. Although Liechtenstein lost 2–0, Houghton {{was impressed by}} Burgmeier's stamina and effort. When Burgmeier was released by Basel in 2008, Houghton, then 12years old, suggested to his grandfather, George Houghton, who was chairman of English side Darlington <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a trial. Following a successful trial, Burgmeier, who was keen to move abroad, was signed by the League Two-side on a one-year contract {{at the end of}} August 2008 to become the first Liechtensteiner to play in England.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Cadet Instructional Staff of the Australian Military Forces, Blamey saw a new opportunity. He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia. After correspondence with the military authorities he persuaded the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Major Julius Bruche, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given the option of taking up an appointment for one of the vacancies in another state. He was appointed to a position in Victoria with the rank of lieutenant, commencing duty in November 1906 with responsibility for school cadets in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, but finally decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great Sun to view.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate. Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.|$|E

5|$|In 1241, the barons in Poitou, {{including}} Henry's step-father Hugh de Lusignan, {{rebelled against}} {{the rule of}} Louis of France. The rebels had counted on aid from Henry, but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army, not arriving in France until the next summer. Henry's campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by Hugh switching sides and returning to support Louis. On 20 May Henry's army was surrounded by the French at Taillebourg; Henry's brother Richard persuaded the French to delay their attack and the King {{took the opportunity to}} escape to Bordeaux. Simon de Montfort, who fought a successful rearguard action during the withdrawal, was furious with the King's incompetence and told Henry <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> locked up like the 10th-century Carolingian king Charles the Simple. The Poitou rebellion collapsed and Henry entered into a fresh five-year truce; his campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over £80,000.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> ranked {{just after the}} great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E
5|$|Teuruarii IV {{left behind}} several notable descendents. In 1923, {{one of his}} sons, Rooteatauira a Teuruarii, was {{involved}} in a controversial embezzlement case that called into question the jurisdiction of French law over native inhabitants of its territories. Rooteatauira, along with his accomplice Tinorrua a Hurahtia, had embezzled various goods to the detriment of Sum-You, a Chinese merchant. In the case, Rooteatauira argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted by native law rather than French law and that the annexation was illegal since it was done without the sanctioned of the King of Rurutu or the approval of the French Parliament. However, the French colonial court ruled that the annexation was valid and that he would be prosecuted by French law since the offense was committed against a non-native. Rooteatauira was sentenced to two years in prison and fined fifty francs. In 1934, Rooteatauira was appointed chief of Moerai and given an annual pension of seven hundred and twenty francs.|$|E
