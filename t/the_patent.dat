5|$|<b>The</b> <b>patent</b> {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to <b>the</b> <b>patent.</b> <b>The</b> <b>patent</b> also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind <b>the</b> <b>patent.</b> Although the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him {{in response to the}} third and fourth letters.|$|E

5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged on until <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> expired in 1917. A German court ruled <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights {{made an agreement}} with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat. Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights.|$|E

5|$|This {{letter is}} seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing <b>the</b> <b>patent.</b> It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{essential}} elements of <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> invention are established, determining {{whether there is an}} infringement is simply an exercise in comparison between the allegedly infringing thing and <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> invention.

5|$|In Elizabethan England, music {{printing}} was {{regulated by}} two royal patents {{issued by the}} queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer John Day's death in 1584, <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, {{who were members of}} the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> producing works with his assignee, Thomas East. The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley {{to take advantage of the}} resulting power vacuum.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{tradition}} in the town that a local man, Thomas Highs, was the inventor of a spinning jenny and the water frame in the 1760s, the latter invention being pirated by Richard Arkwright, who subsequently made a fortune from <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> royalties.|$|E

5|$|Losh, Wilson & Bell's first {{ironworks}} {{was founded}} in 1809 at Walker, beside the alkali works, carrying out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines.

5|$|Much of {{his work}} at <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> office related to {{questions}} about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions {{about the nature of}} light and the fundamental connection between space and time.|$|E
5|$|The Drapier's last letter, An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament, was {{completed}} in June 1725.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of this article we analyse the {{complete}} set of patent cases filed at <b>the</b> <b>Patents</b> Court in England and Wales during the period 2000 – 2008.

5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. <b>The</b> <b>patent</b> dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a patent held by Sanders Associates; <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt.

50|$|The {{wording of}} <b>the</b> <b>Patents</b> Act is {{slightly}} different from Article 52 EPC, but the UK Courts {{have taken the}} view that since the purpose of Section 1 of <b>the</b> <b>Patents</b> Act was to transpose the requirements of Article 52 EPC into UK law, any differences between the EPC and <b>the</b> <b>Patents</b> Act should be ignored. The text of the EPC itself should therefore be regarded as definitive.|$|R
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished <b>the</b> <b>patent,</b> and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
5|$|Bowman then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.|$|E
