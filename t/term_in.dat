40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} important terms o f the consumer law i. e. standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts, which in Polish civil law is functioning as “wzorzec umowy konsumenckiej”. In order to propose its definition, the author analysed the civil code provisions regulating the institution of standard terms (art. 384), the unfair <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts (art. and the provisions of the Council Directive 93 / 13 /EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts. Based on the institution of standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts, three major issues have been flagged out: 1) the content of standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts; 2) the manner of their edition; 3) the medium of transfer. It has been concluded that only the content of the standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts is controlled by the institution of unfair <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts (art. 385 '- 3853 k. c.). In the author’s opinion the Civil Code has introduced the principle of freedom in regard to the way both of edition (art. 384) and the type of the transfer media (art. 60). Further, the author states that the <b>term</b> “standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts” is a declaration of will made by the entrepreneur, or the enterprise, regulating mass goods within the scope of his specific, professional business activity. Standard <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts are formulated in order to make an unlimited number of contracts with an unlimited number of consumers and that is why they do not contain provisions defining an individual consumer or the subject of a given contract...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article aims {{to explain}} how is the address terms (how to say hello) in Indonesian language, and how to explain its use for {{students}} in schools. The use of address term is very important subject to discuss, {{due to the fact}} that many students’ errors are still found in the use of address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> schools ranging from elementary to college. The data used in this article are address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> Indonesian language (there are some address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> Indonesian language). The analysis was done by describing the address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> a dialogue, both in the planned meeting and unplanned. The uses of address <b>terms</b> are described <b>in</b> a context (the use of address terms may depend on the status of a person: age, social status, etc.). This description is expected to be a reference when the teacher explains the address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> Indonesian language teaching. To achieve the maximum teaching Indonesian language, one that can be taken is to teach the intensive use of address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> Indonesian sentences by using the mthode ‘role play’ and the media ‘audio visuel’. Educating the student with address <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> schools, not only will create students who have the ability to speak Indonesian, but also create their attitudes to behave in the social life politely...|$|R

The longest-serving governor was Moore, who served for three terms over twelve years. The state's first governor, Arthur I.
