5|$|From the 1986–87 season, {{the club}} {{finishing}} {{bottom of the}} Football League's basement division was relegated to the Conference National (now National League), {{the highest level of}} non-League football, depending on the ability of the Conference champions to meet FA requirements. Before this, clubs would lose their League status by failing to gain re-election after finishing in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> four of <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> division. Since the 2002–03 season, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> two clubs of League Two face relegation to the Conference/National League.|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach all the way to <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> An open-ocean downline is weighted at <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> half of the field, including many in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> fifth.|$|E
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of coal-fired magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{power can be}} viewed as consisting of two parts; the topping cycle and <b>the</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle. <b>The</b> topping cycle consists of the coal combustor, MHD generator and associated components. <b>The</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle consists of the heat recovery, steam generation, seed recovery/regeneration, emissions control (gas and particulate), ash handling and deposition, and materials evaluation. The report concentrates on <b>the</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle, for which much of the technology was developed at the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI). Because of the complexity of the required technology, a number of issues required investigation. Of specific concern regarding <b>the</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle, was <b>the</b> design of the steam cycle components and emissions control. First, the high combustion temperatures and the use of large quantities of potassium in the MHD combustor results in a difference in the composition of the gases entering <b>the</b> <b>bottoming</b> cycle compared to conventional systems. Secondly, a major goal of the UTSI effort was to use a variety of coals in the MHD system, especially the large reserves of high-sulfur coals available in the United States...|$|R
