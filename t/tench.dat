5|$|The south London {{shipbroker}} William Richards contracted Prince of Wales in 1787 for the First Fleet voyage. Richards selected {{her after}} consultation with Royal Marine officers Watkin <b>Tench</b> and David Collins. Both officers would sail with the Fleet to Australia, <b>Tench</b> as a captain of marines, and Collins as judge-advocate {{for the new}} colony. She was the second-smallest of the First Fleet transports after Friendship, and the last to be contracted to join the voyage.|$|E

5|$|Clatworthy Reservoir is an {{important}} wildlife habitat managed by Wessex Water, and offers facilities for fishing and walking. The river and its tributaries support populations of European water vole (Arvicola amphibius). There may also be populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus). The fish species in the river include: chub, carp, grayling, roach, <b>tench,</b> rudd, perch and pike.|$|E
5|$|Rowing {{is popular}} on the River Weaver, with {{competitive}} clubs in Runcorn, Northwich, and Acton Bridge (The Grange School). Fishing is another pastime {{which takes place}} along the river. Several clubs lease fishing rights for {{different parts of the}} river from British Waterways, as it holds populations of bream, three types of carp, chub, dace, eels, perch, pike, roach, rudd and <b>tench.</b> Fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends.|$|E
5|$|Anglers {{will find}} pike {{in excess of}} , with good stocks of chub, dace, roach, bream, <b>tench,</b> perch, rudd, and gudgeon. There are trout in the upper reaches. There are several access points along the river {{suitable}} for canoeing, and the river has been paddled as far up as Bruton, but above West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the river that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} {{from the first}} Report on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas of a national bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary <b>Tench</b> Coxe.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, <b>tench</b> and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John <b>Tench),</b> demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E

5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, <b>tench,</b> bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E

40|$|The Authors {{describe}} {{two small}} and apparently asymptomatic epidemics of Opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis felineus, which {{were observed in}} provence of Perugia, Umbrie region, Italy. The first one was observed {{in a couple of}} young adults during 2003 because both ones ate pickled (at 2 - 8 °C) <b>tenches</b> fished in Trasimeno Lake in province of Perugia. The second episode was observed during 2006 among eight young adults that ate pickled fishes (<b>tenches,</b> carps and perches, always at 2 - 8 °C); source of these fishes was the same lake. The request for a coproparasitological examination of stools in one of the two subjects of the first episode and in one of the eight subjects of the second episode was the casual observation of an increased count of periferical eosinophils. During January 2006, ten faecal samples of cats, living on “Isola Maggiore” of the Trasimeno Lake, were collected for a parasitological test; 40 % was positive for ova of O. felineus. The Authors describe the diagnostical items for this parasitosis, relate the epidemiological features of this trematode infection, and suggest the importance of a good approach to this zoonotic parasitosis, which interest public health too and never were before observed in Italy among humans...|$|R
5000|$|Van Morrison in Ireland is {{the first}} {{official}} video by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1981 of a concert Morrison recorded in Northern Ireland two years earlier. The video also shows footage of the band whilst touring in Ireland and images of Belfast, including Hyndford Street and Cyprus Avenue. Tony Stewart of the NME states [...] "The band display a range of textures reminiscent of The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, first with the dark resonance of Toni Marcus' violin, then Pat Kyle's bright sharp tenor sax and finally Bobby <b>Tench's</b> prickly electric guitar".|$|R
50|$|Early on 3 April, {{an enemy}} bomber {{forced her to}} dive, and she ran {{submerged}} {{for the remainder of}} the day. That evening, she surfaced once again and soon made radar contact with a good-sized target. The fact the enemy ship carried radar, coupled with the appearance of a second target larger than the first, indicated she was some type of warship escorting a merchantman. Darkness and fog dictated a surface attack. <b>Tench’s</b> report claims the target, the large cargoman, took one torpedo hit and erupted in a splendid pyrotechnic display. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to confirm the kill.|$|R

2500|$|Historian Judy Campbell {{argues that}} it is highly {{improbable}} that the First Fleet {{was the source of}} the epidemic as [...] "smallpox had not occurred in any members of the First Fleet"; the only possible source of infection from the Fleet being <b>Tench’s</b> “bottles”. She points to regular contact between fishing fleets from the Indonesia archipelago, where smallpox was endemic, and Aboriginal people in Australia's North as a far more likely source for the introduction of smallpox. Other historians have argued that {{it is likely that the}} outbreak came from First Fleet sources. [...] This area has been highly contentious, but in the 2014 review by Christopher Warren, in Journal of Australian Studies it was argued that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox without the knowledge of Governor Phillip.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1972 The Jeff Beck Group {{travelled}} to United States to join Beck at TMI {{studios in}} Memphis, Tennessee, where they recorded the album Jeff Beck Group (1972) with Steve Cropper as producer. The promotional tour which followed included {{an appearance on}} the BBC In Concert series, which was recorded on 29 June 1972 at the Paris Theatre, London. During this session <b>Tench's</b> guitar playing was featured on [...] "Definitely Maybe", a rare occasion whilst he was associated with Beck. On 24 July 1972 The second Jeff Beck Group was officially disbanded and Beck's management released this statement: [...] "The fusion of the musical styles of the various members has been successful within the terms of individual musicians, but they didn't feel it had {{led to the creation}} of a new musical style with the strength they had originally sought".|$|R
25|$|Author and First Fleet officer Watkin <b>Tench,</b> whose {{accounts}} are primary sources {{about the early}} years of the colony, suggested that the epidemic may have been caused by Aborigines disturbing the grave of a French sailor who died shortly after arrival in Australia and had been buried at Botany Bay. However, in his memoir A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales", <b>Tench</b> wrote that he had never heard of the existence of smallpox among the French sailors. Another intriguing possibility mentioned by <b>Tench</b> was that, as the colony's physicians had brought bottles of smallpox-infected material with them from England for use in inoculation against smallpox.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau found <b>Tench's</b> singing pretentious and the songs tedious: [...] "Despite some superb textures, {{this is as}} sloppy and self-indulgent as ever." [...] Roy Carr, writing in NME, felt that the album [...] "falls into that trap whereby the performance far exceeds the material. Beck hasn't lost any of his fire as he rips off solo after solo with flashy confidence". On the other hand, Rolling Stone magazine's Stephen Davis said that Rough and Ready is [...] "a surprisingly, fine piece of work {{from a man who}} wasn't really expected to come back. Beck is back, and in pretty good shape too." [...] Derek Johnson of NME reviewed the single [...] "Got the feeling" [...] positively and called it [...] "an excellent disc combining a strong commercial element with an altogether more progressive approach".|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Beck Group was {{not well}} {{received}} by contemporary music critics. OZ magazine's Charles Shaar Murray gave it a negative review, while Billy Walker of Sounds found it inferior to Rough and Ready, and NMEs Roy Carr felt {{that the quality of}} the performances [...] "far exceeds that of the material". In his review for Rolling Stone, John Mendelsohn was highly impressed by Beck's [...] "genius" [...] playing, but found it hampered {{by the rest of the}} band: [...] "When either Bob <b>Tench's</b> vocals or Max Middleton's usually pleasant but seldom arresting and never-smoothly-integrated jazz piano are basking therein, Jeff Beck Group's music is mostly just dull — commonplace and predictable." [...] Rob Mackie from the Record Mirror expressed a similar sentiment and said that listeners would not be able to tell whether they are [...] "listening to the band led by one of Britain's best ever guitarists".|$|R
5000|$|Ten of the 29 Tench-class {{submarines}} {{were completed}} {{in time to}} conduct war patrols in World War II, entering service beginning in late 1944. They finished what the previous classes had largely accomplished: the near-destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet. Another significant contribution was the rescue of downed aviators near Okinawa and Japan. Two additional boats (Cutlass and Diablo) entered Japanese waters on their first war patrols immediately after the 13 August 1945 cease-fire. Construction on the last four of the class was suspended, and they were completed 1948-1951. Postwar, 24 of the 29 <b>Tenches</b> were modernized under the Fleet Snorkel and Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) programs, with most continuing in US service into the early 1970s.
