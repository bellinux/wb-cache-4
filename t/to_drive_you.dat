6000|$|... "It {{would please}} me <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> {{straight}} {{through to the}} settlement, but there's a load of things I want at Calhoun's up yonder," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "One feels diffident about intruding on {{this great}} quietness," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I fancy {{you had a}} purpose in asking me <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Deuce take me if I {{would have}} asked her, then, if I had known 'twas going <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>thee</b> out of the house! Now, come, Bob, I'll {{find a way of}} {{arranging}} it and sobering it down, so that it shall be as melancholy as you can require--in short, just like a funeral, if thou'lt promise to stay?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It is {{the secret}} society which has planned the great rising which is <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> out of Germany, just as you have been driven out of Russia.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is my business, signore. I am very {{attentive}} to my duties. If you permit me <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> to our splendide--our magnifico hotel--you will confer a favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall have}} to leave you, Mrs Drassilis,' she said. 'Tell Jarvis <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> {{wherever}} you want to go. I am going with my husband to see my boy Oggie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{admitted}} Lane good-humoredly. [...] "I'm sure {{no good at}} dogs. If you're going <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> them, <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> speak Karalit or French. Plain English cussin's no blame use." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sweet girl! {{though only}} once we met, [...] That meeting I shall ne'er forget; [...] And though we ne'er may meet again, [...] Remembrance will thy form retain; [...] I would not say, [...] "I love" [...] but still [...] My senses {{struggle}} with my will; [...] In vain <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>thee</b> from my breast, [...] My thoughts {{are more and}} more represt, [...] In vain, I check the rising sighs, [...] Another to the last replies; [...] Perhaps this is not love, but yet [...] Our meeting I can ne'er forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you still}} to learn, darling--I can't help again putting it to you--that I {{get on with}} everybody? That's just what I don't seem able <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> into <b>you.</b> Only see how I get on with YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't {{mean to say}} {{you walked}} here!' said Mrs Griffith, as she shut the front door. 'Fancy that, when you could have all the {{carriages}} in Blackstable <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> about!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{appeared}} thoughtful. [...] "Does it?" [...] she said. [...] "Still, do you know, I fancy that if {{they had}} tried <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> out, you would have stayed in spite of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do. I dote on thee!" [...] {{answered}} the Gardener earnestly; [...] "but no true man will neglect his duty {{for the sake}} of love. My duty is <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> out, so--out you go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, monsieur. Yet this I {{would ask}} you to {{remember}} after I am gone. I have not come to you as one seeking assistance, as one <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by need. I am no returning prodigal, as I have said. I am one who, needing nothing, asking nothing, master of his own destinies, has come <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>driven</b> by affection only, urged by the love and gratitude he bears you {{and will continue to}} bear you." ...|$|R

60|$|I know thou wilt be {{afflicted with}} a {{thousand}} temptations <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> despair, that thy faith may be faint, &c. But against all them set thou the word of God, the promise of grace, the blood of Christ, and the examples of God's goodness to the great backsliders that are for thy encouragement recorded in the scriptures of truth; and remember, that turning to God after backsliding, is the greatest piece of service thou canst do for him, and the greatest honour thou canst bring to the blood of Christ; and know farther, that God, to show his willing reception of so unworthy a creature, saith, there shall be joy in heaven at thy conversion to him again (Luke 15:7, 10).|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> too hard, but I'm only stating {{an obvious}} fact," [...] he concluded. [...] "Now I'll leave {{you to think}} it over while I {{interview}} the porter of the sleeping-car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are, citizen," [...] Harry {{said in a}} rough voice, [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come, for it's no joke waiting about on such nights as this. Where am I <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But when am I to see you?" [...] cried Mr. Crewe, as near genuine alarm as he ever got. [...] "You {{never let}} me see you. I was going <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> home in the motor by moonlight." ...|$|E

Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being allowed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> with <b>you.</b> Of course I'm not accustomed to associating with society people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted circles!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no--not if I am {{on hand to}} {{keep the}} races apart. Now I'm going <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> hard, and <b>you</b> must all hang on. I want to pull into the agency before dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know the}} man I dealt with then. You {{warranted}} the brute good-tempered and easy <b>to</b> <b>drive.</b> I'll give <b>you</b> five dollars if you'll take {{him out of the}} stable and harness him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, besides, {{if you do}} get lost, it is of no consequence. You {{can always}} ask the way back; or, if worst comes to worst, you can take a cab, and tell the man <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} hurry; or, rather, as I hate hurry in all things, I {{would say that}} there is ground for despatch. Mind, I do not wish <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you.</b> If you do not like your cousin, say so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{grinned and}} {{looked a little}} foolish, but he didn't resent it. You see he was quite used to that sort of thing. [...] "Aren't you afraid that Bully will try <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> out of that house?" [...] he ventured.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] replied Joshua, {{with more}} of alacrity than one would have {{believed}} him capable. [...] "I'll tell Susan <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> on, and <b>you</b> and I will walk home across the fields, if you like." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Lt. Garber says of {{the subway}} hijackers, [...] "Someone down there knows how <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a train. <b>You</b> don't pick that up {{watching}} Sesame Street".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps not--perhaps not," [...] sighed the minister. [...] "At any rate, we {{must not}} let him be <b>driven</b> <b>to</b> despair. <b>You</b> must help me, Lucy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't, Nie. I {{promise you}} that. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> to anything. And I guess you know {{ten times as}} well {{what you want to}} do, as I do, anyway. I ain't going to worry you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! but I {{want you}} to be prepared," [...] said she; [...] "or rather, perhaps, to tell the truth, I want <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> to an answer without preparation. Is it not true that you made her an offer, and that she {{accepted}} it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Answ. So far {{forth as}} such wickedness was in thy heart, so far did {{the devil and}} thine own heart seek <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> despair, and drown thee there; but thou hast forgot the {{question}}; {{the question is not}} whether then thou wast troubled with such iniquities, but whether thy fears of damnation at that time were not just and good, because grounded upon thy present condition, which was, for that thou wast out of Christ, in thy sins, and under the curse of the law; and whether now, since the spirit of adoption is come unto thee, and hath thee, and hath done that for thee as hath been mentioned; I say, whether thou oughtest for anything whatsoever to give way to the same fear, from the same ground of damnation; it is evident thou oughtest not, because the ground, the cause, is removed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better be}} {{prepared}} for one, if <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> her as <b>you</b> have been doing." [...] He flung back the saloon scuttle. [...] "You'd have swamped her in another hour or two--the cabin floorings are all awash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take the {{left-hand}} {{road at the}} end of town," [...] replied the man, more calmly. [...] "Ten miles down you'll come to a fork. There's where the I.W.W.'s will turn off to go up into the foot-hills. Anderson just 'phoned. You can head off his car if it's on the hill road.
