5|$|At 18, Davidson {{tried out}} for the United States {{eventing}} team and was accepted. He won his first medal {{as a member of}} the silver-medal-winning US team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that, Davidson went to win gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics and silver in 1996, participating unsuccessfully in 1988. He has also competed repeatedly at both the World Equestrian Games and the Pan American Games, winning medals at both, as well as winning repeatedly at the <b>top-level</b> Badminton Horse Trials and Rolex Kentucky Three Day events. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Davidson was a consistently <b>top-level</b> rider on both the American and international eventing scenes. He is also known for his horse breeding and training abilities.|$|E
5|$|Mayo and Piepoli {{would both}} test {{positive}} for erythropoietin later {{in their careers}} at the Tour de France, and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, all leading to lengthy suspensions, while Petacchi made a successful return to <b>top-level</b> cycling and to the Giro in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Men's {{football}} {{has been}} included in every Summer Olympic Games except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's football tournament at the Olympics is not a <b>top-level</b> tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players. Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996.|$|E

5|$|A {{standout}} junior {{track and}} field athlete and footballer, Selwood entered <b>top-level</b> football early, joining the TAC Cup competition as a bottom-aged player. His accomplishments as a junior included Most Valuable Player awards at state and international levels, captaining Australia in the International Rules Series, and selection in the All-Australian and TAC Cup Team of the Year sides. Despite a serious knee injury during his final year of junior football, Selwood was selected with Geelong's first pick, and seventh overall, in the 2006 AFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. Thousands of police and Carabinieri with {{helicopters}} and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by <b>top-level</b> forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. When using these systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in <b>top-level</b> competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{thirteen}} nations {{took part}} and were {{split into two}} groups. The top seven teams (Pool A) played for the World Championship. The other six (Pool B) played for ranking purposes. Generally eight teams played in the <b>top-level</b> Championship, although the number varied over the years, going as low as three (in 1953) and as high as twelve (in 1959). The same format was used until 1992. The format was criticized because often the gold medal winner was decided before the final game was played, such as at the 1988 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Miller's form {{mirrored}} {{the rest of}} the Hibs team as it went into a slump in 2010, leading to the departure of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a <b>top-level</b> player. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E
5|$|Ronald Perelman's solely owned MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings (Mafco) {{acquired}} a majority interest in Panavision in 1998, via a Mafco subsidiary. After aborted attempts {{to create a}} film-style video camera in the 1970s and 1980s, Panavision joined the digital revolution in July 2000, establishing DHD Ventures in partnership with Sony.

Goldberger was {{able to return to}} <b>top-level</b> competition within less than a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{history of}} the Roman military describes the major chronological transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces. The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than {{they tend to be}} in modern defence forces. Within the <b>top-level</b> branches of army and navy, structural changes occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic structural evolution.|$|E
5|$|A bitter union strike {{began in}} May 1941, which was {{resolved}} without the angered Walt Disney's involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt Disney Productions was {{being set up}} as a union shop, Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the US government on a Good Neighbor policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from <b>top-level</b> animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a <b>top-level</b> party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{introduced}} {{players with}} <b>top-level</b> experience such as Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce. In {{his second season}} the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position, followed by three years of play-off semifinal defeats. They also reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shootout which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis's position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent, replaced two months later by Steve Bruce. Bruce shook up a stale team, taking them from mid-table into the play-offs where they beat Norwich City on penalties to win promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was dropped}} after two matches in 195657, ending his {{first-class}} career. After his playing career was over, Harvey took up umpiring, {{and made his}} first-class debut in 197475. He became a regular official {{over the next few}} seasons and then broke into international umpiring in 197879. In that summer, Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Test. The following season he made his final appearances at international level, presiding over another Test and four ODIs. His last season of <b>top-level</b> domestic umpiring was in 198182 during which he officiated in two matches. He finished his career having presided over 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E
5|$|In rugby league, Wigan Warriors, Salford Red Devils and Leigh Centurions {{compete in}} the Super League, the <b>top-level</b> {{professional}} rugby league football club competition in Europe. Wigan have won the Super League/Rugby Football League Championship twenty–one times, the Challenge Cup nineteen times, and the World Club Challenge three times. Swinton Lions, Oldham Roughyeds and Rochdale Hornets play in the second tier Championship. There is also a large network of junior/community rugby league clubs across the metropolitan area which act as feeder teams to the elite sides, the most notable being Manchester Rangers. In rugby union, Stockport's Sale Sharks {{compete in the}} Guinness Premiership, and won the league in 2006. Whitefield based Sedgley Park RUFC compete in National Division One, Manchester RUFC in National Division Two and Wigan side Orrell R.U.F.C. in National Division Three North.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City won the 2015–16 Premier League, {{their first}} <b>top-level</b> {{football}} championship. They {{are one of}} only six clubs to have won the Premier League {{since its inception in}} 1992. A number of newspapers described their title win as the greatest sporting upset ever, considering {{at the start of the}} season they were favourites to face relegation. Multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. The club's previous highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as Division One. Throughout Leicester's history, they have spent all but one season within the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship).|$|E
5|$|Merv Harvey {{broke into}} the Victorian state team during the 1940–41 season and played in three {{first-class}} matches. The highlight of {{the first phase of}} his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of <b>top-level</b> cricket and halted Harvey’s progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter, losing his best cricketing years to the war.|$|E
5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in <b>top-level</b> racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted her head {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{refused to}} turn professional, and {{continued}} running as amateur in Finland. In 1933, {{he ran his}} first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds {{in violation of the}} IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi's suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year <b>top-level</b> career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.|$|E
5|$|Robinson started {{competing}} in her childhood and, {{after graduating from}} high school in 1983, she began racing in semi-tractors. She achieved early success with 30 victories, and moved into the GATR Truck Series becoming the championship's rookie of the year for 1984. Four years later, Robinson started {{competing in}} stock car racing where she became the first woman to win a <b>top-level</b> NASCAR- sanctioned race that same year, finishing a career-high third place in the points standings. The following season, Robinson won two races and battled for the Charlotte/Daytona Dash Series championship in which she finished third overall. She was twice voted the Charlotte/Daytona Dash Series Most Popular Driver.|$|E
5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a <b>top-level</b> domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Clinton {{took office}} as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name. She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven <b>top-level</b> positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one before they even existed. This did not guarantee the team a <b>top-level</b> license, it simply qualified them for it, but they were later announced as having received a four-year World Tour license. Whether intentionally or incidentally, this corresponded to the initial financial guarantee Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work. This afforded the team automatic invitations to all World Tour events, including the season's three Grand Tours.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m {{backstroke}}, 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in <b>top-level</b> swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.|$|E
5|$|Mired in this {{theoretical}} crisis, the Modern Benoni remained unpopular in the 1990s. Veselin Topalov was {{the only}} <b>top-level</b> player to play it regularly, and he too generally preferred the 2...e6 3.Nf3 c5 move order. At {{the beginning of the}} new millennium, the theoretician John Watson published a well-regarded survey of the opening that {{may have contributed to the}} opening's revival. Many of the ideas he recommended, such as 9...Qh4+ versus the Taimanov Attack and 9...Nh5 in the Modern Main Line, grew in popularity after its publication. The opening regained some more of its former respectability when Vladimir Kramnik, needing a win with Black against Peter Leko, played it in the second to last game of the 2004 World Championship. While he did achieve a winning position at one point, the game ended in a draw. Nevertheless, Étienne Bacrot, Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk have all since used the Modern Benoni at the highest levels of competition, while Vugar Gashimov became the opening's most notable proponent. He was the strongest player willing to use the original 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 move order and defend Black's cause in both the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line.|$|E
