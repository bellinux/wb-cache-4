5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
