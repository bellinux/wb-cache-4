50|$|Although {{portions}} 608 and 609, {{on which}} St Brigid's Convent was erected {{in the early}} 1900s, were subdivided almost immediately after purchase from the crown in 1865, and changed tenure from 1866, {{it is possible that}} the first development of the site only took place after all six subdivisions of portion 608, with frontages to both Upper and Lower Clifton Terrace, were acquired in 1873 by Lydia Pigott, widow of Gayndah grazier Peter John Pigott. In December 1874 Mrs Pigott married Brisbane broker and merchant, William Horsley, and they appear to have been resident at Kenilworth, on Mrs Horsley's property on Clifton Terrace, by 1876. Extensive <b>terracing</b> on <b>portion</b> 608, still evident on the ground, is likely to have been developed as part of the grounds of Kenilworth. In 1889 Lydia Horsley acquired title to an adjacent block, subdivision 11 of portion 609. The Horsleys resided at Kenilworth until , and the house appears to have been rented out for several years prior to its acquisition by the Sisters of Mercy in May 1902, for the sum of Â£1610.|$|R

Gardens were created in 1818 by {{demolishing}} the house's riding-house and stables, and the main floor-level <b>terrace</b> (including the <b>portion</b> over the water-gate) was retained. The lease was repeatedly renewed (passing to the Earl of Harrington) until in or around 1853, when the land and house became crown freehold (housing the Ministry of Transport c.1930, and later parts of what would become the Ministry of Defence). It was demolished to build the current MOD building in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|... 1934: An {{addition}} to the East Wing added surgical suites, occupational and therapy rooms, and classrooms. This building was the second to be financed by the Citizens' Aid Society. Former offices in the other buildings were converted to patient rooms and the final capacity of Glen Lake Sanatorium was 680 patients.1936: The peak of the tuberculosis epidemic in Hennepin County occurred. The Glen Lake Sanatorium's population exceeded 700, with patients in hallways on gurneys and porches enclosed and transformed into wards. In 1936, the average stay by a patient at Glen Lake was 538 days.1961: Chemotherapy had all but eliminated the need for extended stays in a sanatorium. Hennepin County leased the Glen Lake Sanatorium campus to the State of Minnesota. The state's Department of Public Welfare converted the sanatorium to a psycho-geriatric nursing home to serve aging residents of its state hospital system. It was named Oak Terrace Nursing Home {{in reference to the}} original post office address of Glen Lake Sanatorium, which was Oak <b>Terrace,</b> MN. A <b>portion</b> of the main building continued to house tuberculosis patients and operated as the Minnesota State Sanatorium.1976: The last tuberculosis patient was discharged and the sanatorium officially closed.1990: The state closed the nursing home when the Department of Human Services (formerly DPW) moved to a decentralized system of care. 1993: The entire campus, excepting the children's camp which is located in Eden Prairie, was razed. The Glen Lake Golf and Practice Center operated by Three Rivers Park District now occupies the site.|$|R
5000|$|Slates Hot Springs is {{the southernmost}} {{of the four}} groups of hot springs in coastal Monterey County. In 1918, J. A. Little owned the site. The water there issued at ten {{principal}} points in a distance of , halfway up {{the face of the}} bluffs that here border the ocean. A small private bathhouse has been built near the easternmost spring. The waters range in temperature from [...] to , are mildly sulphuretted, and the run-off streams are lined with abundant green algous growth. Small deposits of alum, gypsum, and carbonate of lime or magnesia were noted at the edge of one spring. The waters taste distinctly sweetish.About [...] northwest of the main group, on the left bank of Hot Creek, is another spring, [...] in temperature. This spring yields perhaps [...] a minute and was in 1918 used for laundering clothes.It is said that the location of the springs was described by an Indian to Thomas B. Slate, who made his way southward with difficulty along the steep, brushy slopes, and succeeded in finding only the warm spring beside the creek. Later, however, he came down the coast in a boat, found the springs on the bluff, and settled near them in 1868. The locality is occasionally made a camping place by deer hunters, but as of 1918, it is about [...] by trail beyond {{the southern end of the}} wagon road, it was not often visited.The formation exposed along the bluffs is of slates that have been described as being probably of Jurassic age. They are overlain by [...] of gravel that is deposited on an ocean <b>terrace</b> along this <b>portion</b> of the coast. The heated water apparently emerges at the base of the gravel, though small warm flows also issue from the slate, close to the surf. It is said that when garden land on the terrace back of the springs has been irrigated for several weeks by a mountain stream the seepage water has so reduced the temperature of the hot springs that they are only tepid.|$|R
