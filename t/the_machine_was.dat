5|$|On 10 November 2015, Microsoft {{released}} a security update to mitigate a security vulnerability in BitLocker that allowed authentication to be bypassed by employing a malicious Kerberos key distribution center, if the attacker had physical {{access to the}} machine, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> part of domain and had no PIN or USB protection.|$|E
5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens {{to build a}} similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E
30|$|Machines have a {{predetermined}} orientation (i.e., <b>machines</b> may <b>be</b> located either horizontally or vertically). <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> horizontally located if the longer side of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> parallel to <b>the</b> x-axis. On <b>the</b> contrary, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> vertically located if the longer side {{is parallel to}} the y-axis.|$|R
5000|$|Availability = {{run time}} / total time, by {{definition}} {{this is the}} percentage of the actual amount of production time <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> running to <b>the</b> production time <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> available.|$|R
5000|$|Power-Button Light will flash On/Off {{constantly}} when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> powered off. This {{is due to}} the BIOS that {{expects to}} be connected to the Aurora ALX R1 chassis lighting to [...] "pulsate" [...] on/off when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> off.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{built with}} {{drawings}} from the Danish living history museum Middelaldercentret, who, in 1989, {{were the first}} to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet. It was built in Wiltshire with expertise from the Danish museum.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have invented a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|II (Sturm)./JG 4 {{took off}} for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they {{stumbled}} upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two twin-engine aircraft damaged, {{as well as two}} trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> probably a Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E
5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building {{his own version}} of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E

25|$|Set-up reduction: {{typically}} {{necessary to}} achieve mixed model production, a key distinction can be made between internal and external setup. Internal setups (e.g. removing a die) refers to tasks when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> not working, while external setups can <b>be</b> completed while <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> running (ex:transporting dies).|$|R
50|$|A {{model of}} <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> {{exhibited}} at <b>the</b> London Science Museum. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> {{made of wood}} and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop.|$|R
5|$|On 13 January 2013, {{the band}} {{announced}} that the album would be released in June under the title 13. Brad Wilk of Rage Against <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>was</b> chosen as the drummer, and Rick Rubin {{was chosen as the}} producer. Mixing of the album commenced in February. On 12 April 2013, the band released the album's track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|Redheffer {{moved to}} New York City {{and set up}} a similar scam after {{rebuilding}} his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. He discovered that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Mark 1 was {{to provide}} a {{computing}} resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical use of computers, but it very quickly also became a prototype on which the design of Ferranti's commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, the Philco 2000 Model 212 {{computer}} {{was chosen for}} use in the North American Aerospace Defense Command's famous Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

5|$|The Turk {{made its}} debut in 1770 at SchÃ¶nbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen {{addressed}} the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing {{members of the audience}} to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> ready for a challenger.|$|E
5|$|The launch customer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{cancelled}} {{their order}} in 1991 {{and a number}} of company executives left shortly thereafter. The first machine was finally ready in 1993, but with no launch customer, it was instead loaned as a demonstration unit to the nearby National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. The company went bankrupt in May 1995, and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> officially decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{simultaneously}} {{presented for}} the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of Â£179.95. No external keypad was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself remained.|$|E

5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|Louche: The louche (è€¬è»Š) was {{a mobile}} animal-drawn {{agricultural}} seed drill invented by the Chinese agronomist Zhao Guo, a Han official {{in charge of}} agricultural production {{during the reign of}} Han Wudi in the Han dynasty. According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three ditch diggers under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|E
