5|$|Analysis of <b>the</b> <b>flawed</b> images {{showed that}} the cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had gone wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed <b>the</b> <b>flawed</b> tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E

5|$|Until late 1939, A/S {{work had}} largely been ignored. In the opening {{months of the}} trade defence war, September 1939 to early 1940, three main points arose in this respect.

Thirdly, despite the first two points, losses to Allied shipping from U-boat attack was enough for importance of A/S to increase.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{ultrasonic}} {{method for}} evaluating axial flaw depth in pipes is proposed with circumferential shear vertical, SV, wave. When a conventional {{ultrasonic flaw detection}} technique with pipe transducers is applied to sizing of inner axial <b>flaws</b> in pipes, <b>the</b> wave amplitude reflected at <b>the</b> axial <b>flaw</b> or that transmitted through <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> is not proportional to <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depth. Moreover, <b>the</b> received amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depends on circumferential position. The {{reason is that the}} shear wave beams in the pipe are not parallel, e. g., the refraction angle into steel pipes varies with the circumference position. To improve this, a special shear wave transducer of equi-refraction angle was designed. With this transducer, the wave energy distribution along the wall thickness is nearly uniform, therefore, the transmitted wave amplitude through <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> is expected to be proportional to <b>the</b> <b>flaw</b> depth. To confirm this, we measured the wave amplitude transmitted through an axial slot in a pipe of thickness of 3 mm and diameter of 60 mm. The depths of the axial slot are 33, 50 and 67 % of the thickness. The amplitude transmitted through the slots is found to be nearly proportional to the slot depth...|$|R
