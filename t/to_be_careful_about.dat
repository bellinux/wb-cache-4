5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka {{who had been a}} police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E

25|$|O'Brien, {{alarmed at}} the {{increased}} activity of Sinn Féin in 1915, predicted {{the danger of}} a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB 1916 Rebellion, in which however Sinn Féin were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's {{home until}} {{the last week of}} June 1934; that on some {{occasions}} they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived {{on the north side of}} Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.|$|E
500|$|When the Pam {{character}} discusses her impressive volleyball ability, {{she says}} she played volleyball in junior high, senior high, college and went to volleyball camps most summers. However, in the episode [...] "Job Fair", she said her high school gym brings back memories of her faking PMS {{to get out of}} playing basketball and volleyball. Writer Jen Celotta acknowledged this was a continuity error: [...] "Yeah, we screwed up. I didn't remember that she said that, specifically about volleyball. And we really do try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> those things." ...|$|E

[...] Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight {{breeding}} seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108started races, and 77won, earning a total of $476,949. The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately $ as of [...] ).|$|E
500|$|McCartney, Harrison, and Best {{were under}} 21, and {{therefore}} needed {{the consent of}} their parents {{to enter into a}} contract. Best and his mother— Mona Best, owner of the Casbah Coffee Club— were impressed with Epstein's professional image, as were the other Beatles, because he was a businessman, wore expensive suits, and owned a large car. Best's mother said that Epstein [...] "could be good for them [...] ". McCartney's father was sceptical about a Jewish manager and warned his son <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> finances. Lennon's aunt and guardian Mimi Smith was against the idea, believing that Epstein would lose interest when something else would attract his interest, but Lennon had just turned twenty-one and he ignored his aunt's advice.|$|E
500|$|According to Caballero, SpongeBob was {{the most}} {{challenging}} character to translate to stop motion. It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} {{behavior}} can change. One type is the risky behavior itself, {{resulting in a}} before the event moral hazard. In this case, insured parties behave in a more risky manner, resulting in more negative consequences that the insurer must pay for. For example, after purchasing automobile insurance, some may tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> locking the automobile or choose to drive more, thereby increasing the risk of theft or an accident for the insurer. After purchasing fire insurance, some may tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> preventing fires (say, by smoking in bed or neglecting to replace the batteries in fire alarms). A further example has been identified in flood risk management where it is proposed that the possession of insurance undermines efforts {{to encourage people to}} integrate flood protection and resilience measures in properties exposed to flooding.|$|R
5000|$|If you are {{recruiting}} {{somebody who}} has demonstrated some sort of antisocial behavior and then you are a putting a gun in their hands, you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awfully <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what you <b>are</b> doing.

500|$|McCain {{played an}} {{important}} part in the expansion of U.S. involvement in Cambodia. [...] In April 1970, McCain gave personal briefings to Nixon in Honolulu, and to Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in San Clemente, where he highlighted the threat from North Vietnamese operations in Cambodia and Laos. [...] In particular, he said that Lon Nol's government in Cambodia would soon collapse unless North Vietnamese operations there were stopped, and that with a secure base there, North Vietnam could then launch attacks on South Vietnam which would cause the failure of Vietnamization. [...] McCain additionally said that the schedule for the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Vietnam had to be flexible. [...] McCain's views, which had the support of his subordinate, MACV commander General Creighton Abrams, helped persuade Nixon {{to go ahead with the}} Cambodian Incursion later that month. [...] Kissinger would subsequently tell another admiral, [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> having McCain around the president too much, because he fires up the president." ...|$|E
500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her {{from a sense of}} weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E

MSNBC and National Post journalists interpreted Cosby's joke as a reference to the drugging and sexual assault allegations against him.|$|E

The next day, Papa calls the children into the barn, whips them and tells them never to go to the Wallace store again.|$|E
2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E
