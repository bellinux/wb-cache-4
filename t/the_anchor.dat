5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> line during the decompression stop.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{distribution}} of shear stress along <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section of prestressed bolt was presented. The distribution of shear stress along <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section of prestressed bolt was analyzed with the plane elastic theory. The analytical solution of shear stress along <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section was deduced. Several cases of shear stresses were analyzed with the analytical solution. The results show that shear stress of prestressed bolt are not uniform distribution along <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section; it is has no relations with the prestress value where the shear stress peak value is; the shear stress is at a certain range along <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section; <b>the</b> shear stress peak value increases {{with the increase of}} prestress value;the larger the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> section is, <b>the</b> less of shear stress peak value is...|$|R
40|$|A {{limitation}} {{in research}} on bolt <b>anchoring</b> is <b>the</b> unknown relationship between dynamic perturbation and mechanical characteristics. This paper divides dynamic impulse loads into engineering loads and blasting loads and then employs numerical calculation software FLAC 3 D to analyze the stability of an anchoring system perturbed by an impulse load. The evolution of the dynamic response of the axial force/shear stress in <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system is thus obtained. It is revealed that the corners and middle of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system are strongly affected by the dynamic load, and the dynamic response of shear stress is distinctly stronger {{than that of the}} axial force in <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system. Additionally, <b>the</b> perturbation of the impulse load reduces stress in <b>the</b> <b>anchored</b> rock mass and induces repeated tension and loosening of the rods in <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system, thus reducing the stability of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system. <b>The</b> oscillation amplitude of the axial force in <b>the</b> <b>anchored</b> segment is mitigated far more than that in the free segment, demonstrating that extended/full-length anchoring is extremely stable and surpasses simple anchors with free ends...|$|R

5|$|The {{first port}} of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which Endeavour reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. While in port, an {{accident}} cost the life of master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> cable and was dragged overboard when <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> was released. To replace him, Cook shanghaied a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin}} and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the ionic adsorption on <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> energy of a nematic liquid crystal sample is investigated. We determine the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> energy {{as a function of}} the thickness of the sample, and {{as a function of the}} adsorption energy of ions. We show that the contribution to <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> energy, due to ionic adsorption, can be of the same order of magnitude of <b>the</b> bare <b>anchoring</b> strength. Our analysis generalizes similar calculations previously published by incorporating the effect of adsorbed charges on the potential and field profiles in the sample...|$|R
5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E

He was <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> figure in Beyond Our Ken, which also featured Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee. When the programme {{came to an end}} in 1964, the same cast recorded four series of the comedy Round the Horne.|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
50|$|A {{cytotrophoblast}} cap penetrates {{through the}} fetus' syncytiotrophoblasts and reaches the maternal decidua, forming <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> villus. <b>The</b> cytotrophoblast layer spreads and contacts the cytotrophoblast layers of neighboring anchoring villi, creating a continuous layer called the cytotrophoblastic shell. The cytotrophoblast structures of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> villi that spread out are called cytotrophoblastic columns. Once formation is complete, the cytotrophoblast layer from <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> villi disappears, {{leaving behind a}} mesoderm core surrounded by syncytial cells.|$|R

50|$|In 1911, {{the company}} {{manufactured}} <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> and chain for the ocean liner RMS Titanic. The largest of <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> weighed 15.5 tons and on completion was drawn {{through the streets}} of Netherton on a wagon drawn by 20 shire horses.|$|R
5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|Starting in June 2013 Jon Stewart took a twelve-week {{break to}} direct Rosewater, a {{drama about a}} {{journalist}} jailed by Iran for four months. John Oliver replaced Stewart at <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> desk for two months, {{to be followed by}} one month of reruns. Oliver received positive reviews for his hosting, leading to his departure from the show in December 2013 for his own show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which debuted April 27, 2014 on HBO.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
30|$|The well {{confined}} {{concrete core}} with <b>the</b> proposed <b>anchor</b> reinforcement allowed <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> to develop improved shear behavior, even though concrete in plastic hinge zone experienced substantial damage. However, <b>the</b> observed <b>anchor</b> shear behavior {{may not be}} desirable for the seismic performance of diagonal braces because <b>the</b> full <b>anchor</b> capacity would be achieved at a very large displacement. <b>The</b> proposed <b>anchor</b> shear reinforcement protected well the core concrete while {{further research is needed}} to protect cover concrete.|$|R

This paper compares two methodological approaches to test for <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> effect experimentally: a hypothetical one (subjects answering what-if questions) and a real situation (subjects making decisions involving their own real money). Although previous studies have examined anchoring {{in each of these}} settings separately, no direct comparison is available to date. In this paper, we conduct an experiment to compare anchoring in a hypothetical and a real-purchase setting. As hypothesized, <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> effect is more prevalent in the hypothetical than in the real-purchase condition.

5|$|Al Jaffe, ESPN's vice {{president}} for talent, brought Scott to ESPN2 because {{they were looking for}} sportscasters who might appeal to a younger audience. Scott became one of the few African-American personalities who was not a former professional athlete. His first ESPN assignments were for SportsSmash, a short sportscast twice an hour on ESPN2's SportsNight program. After Keith Olbermann left SportsNight for ESPN's SportsCenter, Scott took his place in <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> chair at SportsNight. After this, Scott was a regular on SportsCenter. At SportsCenter, Scott was frequently teamed with fellow anchors Steve Levy, Kenny Mayne, Dan Patrick, and most notably, Rich Eisen. Scott was a regular in the This is SportsCenter commercials.|$|E
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern {{to be given}} by the engines. However, as the ship backed off the rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|E
5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by the length of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E

50|$|As soon as {{the news}} of the {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> two <b>anchors</b> was announced, a dispute erupted over who was the owner of these artefacts. The protagonists were the governments of Australia, South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Government argued that it was in the national interest for it to own <b>the</b> <b>anchors,</b> South Australia argued the significance of <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> {{as a part of the}} sloop that charted most of its coastline, while Western Australia argued that <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> were found in its waters.

Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden.
