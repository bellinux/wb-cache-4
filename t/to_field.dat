5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability <b>to</b> <b>field</b> a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable <b>to</b> <b>field</b> their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be {{promoted to the}} rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted <b>to</b> <b>field</b> marshal because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted <b>to</b> <b>field</b> marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics {{were the}} last Winter Games to be run before the {{introduction}} of more strenuous qualification standards.

The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft's fuel, armament and radio systems, but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it passed its manufacturer's trials the following day.|$|E

After a short stay in the Coldstream Guards, Adolphus entered the Anglican Church, having the living of Swillington from 1847–1872.

5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and <b>to</b> <b>field</b> {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability <b>to</b> <b>field</b> an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E
5|$|At the {{inception}} of the Premier League in 1992–93, just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland. By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36percent of the total. In the 2004–05 season the figure had increased to 45percent. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side <b>to</b> <b>field</b> an entirely foreign starting line-up, and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.

Moreover, the Army had <b>to</b> <b>field</b> and maintain part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan.

5|$|Australia {{competed in}} Pool D—along with Dominican Republic, Italy and Venezuela—in {{the first round}} at Cracker Jack Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The other three teams were able <b>to</b> <b>field</b> {{a large number of}} Major League players. Of players born outside the United States on 2006 Major League Opening Day rosters, the Dominican Republic (85) and Venezuela (43) had more than all other {{countries}} and between them accounted for more than 57% of foreign-born players in the leagues. Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.|$|E
5|$|Australia opted <b>to</b> <b>field</b> an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 in {{the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings {{in the middle}}-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
