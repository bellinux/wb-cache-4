Population decreased, and 15,000 people moved out between 1985 and 1992. Fortunately, in 1987, the Romanian factory ceased the pollution, under pressure from environmental organizations on Bulgarian and Romanian communist leadership. Organizations such as Ekoglasnost provoked the first nationwide demonstrations and strongly influenced the change to democracy.|$|E

25|$|The virus spreads {{by direct}} contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an {{infected}} human or other animals. This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids. Spread of the disease through <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions. Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months. Fruit bats {{are believed to be}} the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 had {{destroyed}} the VVS Western Front by early July. Over 1,000 air victories were filed by German pilots, while another 1,700 were claimed on the ground. Soviet sources admit to 1,669 losses in <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>between</b> the 22 and 30 June. In {{the same period}} the Soviets claimed 662 German aircraft (613 {{in the air and}} 49 on the ground). German losses were 699 aircraft. Some 480 were due to enemy action (276 destroyed and 208 damaged). After only slightly more than a week of fighting, the Luftflotten at the front saw their strength drop to 960 aircraft. In total the VVS suffered 4,614 destroyed (1,438 in the air and 3,176 on the ground) by 30 June. By the end of the fighting in the border areas on 12 July, the Soviet casualties had risen to 6,857 aircraft destroyed against 550 German losses, plus another 336 damaged.|$|E
25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN Single Aviation Market policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.|$|E

25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E
500|$|In 1827, when giving {{evidence}} {{to a government}} select committee on emigration, {{an agent of the}} laird was asked [...] "And were the people willing to go?"; [...] "Some of them", came the reply, [...] "Others were not very willing, they did not like to leave the land of their ancestors". Years later an eyewitness, a local shepherd, was more florid in his description of the events: [...] "The people of the island were carried off in one mass, for ever, from the sea-girt spot where they were born and bred... The wild outcries of the men and heart-breaking wails of the women and children filled all <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the mountainous shore of the bay" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{late as the}} 1960s, glowbugs {{were part}} of many {{beginner}} ham stations, and the ARRL Radio Amateur Handbook for those years exhibited a number of such simple, tube-based designs. Today, glowbug operators are enjoying a resurgence of interest among QRP enthusiasts and others {{with a penchant for}} constructing their own equipment. Many hams are assembling [...] "glowbug rigs" [...] on improvised chassis such as tin cakepans and wooden boards, and putting them on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> 7040 – 7050kHz and 7114 – 7125kHz. Amateur radio Glowbug enthusiasts can often be heard communicating on the shortwave bands via CW using Morse code. Popular frequencies to hear glowbug contacts are around 3560kHz and also 3579.5kHz, chosen because crystals for this frequency can be salvaged from discarded color TV sets, along with other transmitter components.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{favorable}} {{conditions for the}} formation of the rolls occur when the lowermost layer of air is unstable, but is capped by an inversion-by a stable layer of air. There must be a moderate wind. [...] This often occurs when upper air is subsiding, such as under anticyclonic conditions, and is also frequently found when radiation fog has formed overnight. Convection occurs below the inversion, with air rising in thermals below the clouds and sinking in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the streets.|$|E
2500|$|Drag: Having the {{cylinders}} {{exposed to the}} airflow increases drag considerably. The answer was the addition of specially designed cowlings with baffles to force <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> {{the cylinders}}. The first effective drag reducing cowling that didn't impair engine cooling was the British Townend ring or [...] "drag ring" [...] which formed a narrow band around the engine covering the cylinder heads, reducing drag. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics studied the problem, developing the NACA cowling which further reduced drag and improved cooling. Nearly all aircraft radial engines since have used NACA-type cowlings. Because radial engines are often wider than similar inlines or vees, {{it is more difficult}} to design an aircraft to minimize cross sectional area, a major cause of drag, although {{by the beginning of the}} Second World War, this disadvantage had largely disappeared as aircraft sizes increased, and multi-row radials increased the power produced in relation to the cross sectional area.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1990s, Shatner made {{numerous}} attempts to reconcile with Doohan, but was unsuccessful for some time, Doohan {{being the only}} former Star Trek co-star refusing {{to be interviewed by}} Shatner for his 1993 memoir Star Trek Memories and its 1994 follow-up, Star Trek Movie Memories. However, an Associated Press article published at the time of Doohan's final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan, already suffering from severe health problems, had forgiven Shatner and they had mended their relationship. At a convention directly preceding Doohan's last one, Sky Conway, the convention's head, stated, [...] "At our show: 'The Great Bird of the Galaxy' in El Paso Texas in November 2003, a celebration of Gene Roddenberry and Star Trek, Bill and Jimmy went on stage together.

2500|$|In January 1952, ADC {{was ordered}} to deploy the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the 25th Air Division at Larson AFB, Washington to Japan, and to relieve the 68th FIS at Itazuke. [...] A {{detachment}} of the ADC squadron was sent to Misawa AB to fly air defense missions over Northern Honshu and Hokkaido against any intruding Soviet aircraft from Sakhalin Island or the Vladivostok area. [...] At Suwon, the 68th had a total of fifty-eight interceptions during February during nighttime hours. [...] It was in February 1952 that the first F-94 was lost in a night interception while pursuing an unknown aircraft over the Yellow Sea. [...] The cause of the loss was unknown. However, a B-26 pilot observed an explosion in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the island of Taeyonp'yong-do {{and the city of}} Haeju in North Korea. [...] A search was made for the aircraft and crew, [...] which continued for almost three months.

2500|$|One {{frequently}} cited text is the Syrian-Greek writer Lucian's 2nd-century satire True History, {{which uses a}} voyage to outer space and conversations with alien life forms {{to comment on the}} use of exaggeration within travel literature and debates. Typical science fiction themes and topoi in True History include: travel to outer space, encounter with alien life-forms (including the experience of a first encounter event), interplanetary warfare and planetary imperialism, motif of giganticism, creatures as products of human technology, worlds working by a set of alternate physical laws, and an explicit desire of the protagonist for exploration and adventure. In witnessing one interplanetary battle between the People of the Moon and the People of the Sun as the fight for the right to colonize the Morning Star, Lucian describes giant space spiders who were [...] "appointed to spin a web in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>between</b> the Moon and the Morning Star, which was done in an instant, and made a plain campaign upon which the foot forces were planted..."
