40|$|ABSTRACT: The tongue {{moves in}} a narrow space which {{influences}} the speech planning process and affects the kinematic properties of the movement. In order to study the possible role of tongue-palate interaction we investigated tongue tip movement together with tonguepalatal contact patterns by means of simultaneous EMA and EPG recordings. Articulatory data for four German speakers were analyzed. Speech material consisted of VC and VC@ sequences with C being /t/ or /s/ and V being stressed tense /a/ or /u/. The relation between the kinematics of the tongue <b>tip</b> <b>closing</b> gesture and changes in tongue-palatal contact patterns in the anterior, posterior and lateral region were studied. Results for /t/ show a large movement amplitude and a short closing gesture duration whereas in /s/ production the movement amplitude is smaller and the duration longer than in /t/. We conclude that in /t/ the tongue tip hits the palate and this impact stops the movement. In /s/ production we suppose that a precise positioning of the tongue tip is achieved. Speaker dependent tongue-palatal contact patterns can be {{explained in terms of}} differences in the palatal shape...|$|E

50|$|Understanding {{the first}} deformational element is well recognized, and, despite limited {{attention}} to the second element, once seen, it is easily understood. Therefore, understanding the third element leads to understanding the surgical-technical approach to correcting the isolated lower-pole and lobule prominence. The latter feature of conchal shape, while not the sole cause of lobular prominence, appears to play a key role. As the cartilage angle, between the concha cavum and the antitragus, becomes more acute (i.e. as the antitragus <b>tips</b> <b>closer</b> towards the concha), this supporting structure outwardly projects the lobule and the lower-third of the ear. This feature has a greater influence upon the lobule position than does the commonly described helical tail.|$|R

As a result, a gate invariance feature emerges: the Fano profile of the transmittance rises as an invariant quantity depending upon the STM tips Fermi energy, due to the symmetric swap in the gate potential of the AFM tip.

40|$|Individual {{molecules}} at {{the edges}} of self-assembled islands grown on Ag(111) can be deliberately switched in their charge state with the electric field from a scanning-probe <b>tip.</b> <b>Close</b> to the threshold voltage for a charge state transition, periodic switching of the charge is directly driven by the cantilever motion in frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (AFM), as can be deduced from the signature in the measured frequency shift. In this regime, the integrated frequency shift yields the tip-sample force that is due to a single additional electron. Further, the signature of the dynamic charging response provides information on the electronic coupling of the molecule to the substrate. In analogy to previous experiments on quantum dots, this may also be used in the future to access excited state properties of single molecules from AFM experiments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Complications of solitary or {{multiple}} osteochondromas are rare {{but have been}} reported in recent literature. Most reported complications arose in patients with multiple and/or sizable osteochondromas. Case presentation: A 22 -year-old, female, Caucasian patient with obesity presented with intermittent knee pain and hematoma of the right calf. The MRI depicted a small, sharp exostosis tip of the dorsal distal femur with a surrounding soft-tissue mass. After profuse bleeding occurred during biopsy of the soft tissue mass, angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the right popliteal artery. In a second-stage surgery the exostosis tip and pseudoaneurysm were resected. Conclusion: Complications can also arise in small, seemingly harmless osteochondromas.

50|$|For {{measurements}} of chemical forces {{the effect of}} the long range van der Waals forces must be subtracted from the frequency shift data. Originally this was done by fitting a power law to the long range 'tail' of the spectrum (when the tip is far from the surface) and extrapolating this over the short range interaction (<b>tip</b> <b>close</b> to the surface). This fitting, however, is very sensitive to where the cut-off between long and short range forces is chosen, causing results of questionable accuracy. Usually the most appropriate method is to perform two spectroscopy measurements, one over any molecule under study, and a second above a lower section of the clean surface, then to directly subtract the second from the first. This method is not applicable to features under study on a flat surface as no lower section may exist.|$|R
