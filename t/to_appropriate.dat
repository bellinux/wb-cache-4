5|$|Interest in the {{monument}} grew after the Civil War. Engineers studied the foundation {{several times to}} determine if it was strong enough. In 1876, the Centennial of the Declaration of Independence, Congress agreed <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> another $200,000 to resume construction.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{successful}} surprise attack, the Polish army in Vilnius managed <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> sizable stocks of supplies and take hundreds of prisoners. When Piłsudski entered the city, a victory parade was held in his honour. The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city were immediately sent to the Paris Peace Conference, and the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E

5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit {{and that of his}} family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E
5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to lack of access <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E

A person is not freed of samsara (the cycle of birth-death-rebirth) and must take birth again after his prescribed pleasure in Svarga or punishment in Naraka is over.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A double ring peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} election, Dunstan {{travelled}} to Canberra {{for the annual}} Premiers' Conference as the sole Labor premier. His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister John Gorton, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded {{more than he had}} hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs in order <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> their kills. They will {{typically}} inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously {{and attempt to}} take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium tax credits designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium tax credits. A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E
5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session <b>to</b> <b>appropriate</b> emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E
