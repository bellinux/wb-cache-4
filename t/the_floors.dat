5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>floor</b> {{vibration}} which {{character was}} overwhelming might interrupt {{the convenience of}} the building users due to the the human activity, it can be controlled by increasing <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> stiffness. One {{of the ways to}} increase <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> stiffness was using the stiffeners (queen post hanger) that should be installed under the plate of <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> According to ISO 2361 - 1 / 2 the criteria of limits for <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency was 4 - 8 Hz. Above the limit, people would experience higher vibration acceleration, the statement implied that if the building users would like to be more convenient with <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> vibration, then <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency should be in the limit that had been determined. There were two ways for predicting <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency namely by means of design guideline that had been developed by Murray et al. (1997) and by means of time history analysis by using ETABS. An appropriate approach for predicting the size of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency had been developed and one of the ways was the method of beam equivalent for composite <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> results of analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency without the stiffeners was 0. 45 Hz with the design guideline; on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency as measured by means of ETABS was 0. 49 Hz. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> natural frequency was above the limit that had been determined. For <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> that had been installed with <b>the</b> stiffeners, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> frequency was 5. 56 Hz by means of design guideline and was 5. 26 by means of ETABS. Due to the dynamic load that was taken from the heel impact, the displacement of vertical maximum direction occured in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> extend namely 1. 18 cm before the stiffeners was installed and was 0. 36 cm after the stiffeners was installed.

5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15–50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. <b>The</b> <b>floors</b> of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1–2km. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its closure, the stadium {{consisted}} of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field.

The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its marble halls (though <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> were actually terrazzo) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium, and the facade that faces onto Avenell Road.

The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
