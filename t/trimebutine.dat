40|$|Curing {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) in mammals is a {{daunting}} task {{because of the lack}} of permissive mechanisms and strong inhibitory responses at and around the lesion. The neural cell adhesion molecule L 1 CAM (L 1) has been shown to favor axonal regrowth and enhance neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity but delivery of full-length L 1 or its extracellular domain could encounter difficulties in translation to therapy in humans. We have, therefore, identified several small organic compounds that bind to L 1 and stimulate neuronal survival, neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth in an L 1 -dependent manner. Here, we assessed the functions of two L 1 mimetics, <b>trimebutine</b> and honokiol, in regeneration following SCI in young adult mice. Using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) score, we found that ground locomotion in trimebutine-treated mice recovered better than honokiol-treated or vehicle-receiving mice.

The study was aimed at examining peculiarities of the course of chronic pancreatitis in children and determine effectiveness of comprehensive treatment using <b>trimebutine</b> maleate. Patients and methods. 100 children aged 7 – 18 years with chronic pancreatitis were examined. The control group was comprised of 30 virtually healthy children of the similar age. Results. According to the anamnestic data, eating disorder (68. 0 %), pancreatic exacerbation of chronic noncalculolis cholecystitis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (65. 0 and 50. 0 %, respectively) are significant risk factors of chronic pancreatitis in children; obesity (40. 0 %) and hypodynamia (35. 0 %) are less common risk factors. The main clinical manifestations of chronic pancreatitis are “girth half” spastic abdominal pain attacks (78. 0 %), nausea regardless of food intake (65. 0 %) and bile emesis not attenuating the patient’s condition (45. 0 %). The study established moderate manifestations of exocrine pancreatic failure. The vasointestinal polypeptide level was low at erosive lesion of gastroduodenal zone’s mucosa (2. 15 ± 0. 3 ng/l) and cardiac esophageal sphincter failure (2. 29 ± 0. 2 ng/l).

This study aimed to manage some lower GI-NMS {{in a group of}} patients with PD. A total of 40 patients (17 males, 23 females; mean age 76. 05 ± 2. 09 years) were randomly selected for this study. Patients were confirmed to have PD (modified Hoehn–Yars scale: 2. 075 ± 0. 4) who had undergone levodopa or dopamine agonist treatment. In the non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-Quest), regarding GI complaints, the following were recorded: abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation of mild-to-moderate severity. Laboratory studies, abdominal ultrasound, and upper and lower digestive endoscopies were performed to rule out organic issues. All patients increased their water intake to 2 L/d and alimentary fiber to 20 – 25 g/d. Twenty patients received <b>trimebutine</b> 200 mg three times daily half an hour before meals. The other 20 patients received probiotics (60 mg per-tablet of two lactic bacteria: Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis), 2 ×/d, 1 hour after meals for 3 months along with the reassessment of GI complaints. Our results demonstrated that there were significant statistical differences in all assessed symptoms in the first group: 1. 55 ± 0. 51 vs 0. 6 ± 0. 5 (P< 0. 0001) for abdominal pain; 1. 6 ± 0. 5 vs 0. 45 ± 0. 51 (P< 0. 0001) for bloating; and 1. 5 ± 0. 51 vs 0. 85 ± 0. 67 (P= 0. 0014) for constipation with incomplete defecation. The second group displayed statistical differences only for abdominal pain 1. 45 ± 0. 51 vs 1. 05 ± 0. 69 (P= 0. 00432) and bloating 1. 4 ± 0. 5 vs 0. 3 ± 0. 47 (P< 0. 0001). For constipation with incomplete defecation, there was a slight improvement. Thus, there was no significant statistical difference: 1. 35 ± 0. 49 vs 1. 15 ± 0. 49 (P= 0. 2040).

SUMMARY This paper reviews evidence {{relating to the}} site and mechanism of action of “centrally acting” agents which may affect visceral sensitivity. Anti-depressant drugs such as amitriptyline as well as the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are thought to act at the level of the cen-tral nervous system (CNS). There is increasing evidence that the peripheral effects of these drugs may contribute to their ability to attenuate somatic pain but there is no evidence that these compounds affect visceral sensitivity per se. Opiates, including morphine and drugs such as <b>trimebutine</b> and fedotozine, are effective at reducing visceral nociception, and recent data suggest that this occurs as a result of a peripheral action at the level of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). One possibility is that visceral stimulation induces long term alterations in the CNS. Cytokines in the CNS are known to be involved in the modulation of pain and there is also evidence to suggest that centrally acting cytokines may play a role in the production of visceral hypersen-sitivity.

40|$|Objective: Drug-induced {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (DIEPS) often substantially compromise {{quality of}} life (QOL) of patients receiving drugs with central antidopaminergic activities. A lack of comprehensive screening method based upon patients ' subjective symptoms for detecting DIEPS appears to have prevented pharmacists from delivering satisfactory pharmaceutical care for these patients. Thus, we have attempted to develop a comprehensive questionnaire for screening patients having higher risks of developing DIEPS. Methods: One hundred fourteen outpatients taking gastroprokinetic drugs (itopride, cisapride, <b>trimebutine,</b> domperi-done and metoclopramide) at least 2 weeks participated in the study. One patient with familial Parkinson disease served as a positive reference. They undertook a questionnaire consisting of 9 comprehensive questions written in non-technical words that were aimed to detect typical symptoms of Parkinsonism including akathisia and dyskinesia. Each symptom was scored in a semiquantitative scale [i. e., from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) ] by the patients.

40|$|SUMMARY Current {{approaches}} to treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) aim to normalise disturbed intestinal physiology. The most effective centrally acting drugs are tricyclic antidepressants. Alosetron, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist {{is effective in}} women with diarrhea-predominant IBS whilst tegaserod and prucalopride are 5 -HT 4 agonists enhancing bowel motility in constipation-predominant IBS. Serotonergic receptor modulation has been the first targeted pharmacological intervention. The development of new drugs constitutes a major challenge as there are many targets along the brain-gut axis and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Newer tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects and corticotrophin releasing factor- 1 (CRF- 1) antagonists are examples of future centrally acting drugs. Agents that alter visceral sensitivity include kappa-opioid agonists (fedotozine, <b>trimebutine,</b> asimadoline), alpha- 2 adrenoreceptor agonists (clonidine, lidamidine), tachykinin receptor antagonists (neurokinin A, substance P) and other experimental anti-nociceptive drugs (GABA-B receptor agonists). COX- 2 inhibitors may be effective for postinfectious IBS. Drugs potentially useful in controlling intestinal motility and secretion other than serotonergic receptors modulators, include muscarinic receptors antagonists (derifenacin, zamenifenacin), octreotide and CCK- 1 receptor antagonists (dexloglumide). Neurotrophins (NT- 3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor) are promising factors {{for the treatment of}} IBS patients with constipation. The development of new and effective drugs for IBS requires a more detailed understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, a fact that will allow us a more targeted intervention.

The mechanism of the oxidation process was discussed. A simple, precise, inexpensive and sensitive voltammetric method has been developed for {{the determination of the}} cited drug (TB). According to the linear relation between the peak current and the concentration, DPV and SWV methods were used for the quantitative determination of the cited drug in pharmaceutical dosage forms and urine samples. These two voltammetric techniques allow quantitation of TB over the concentration range from 1. 0 × 10 - 6 to 1. 1 × 10 - 5 and 1. 0 × 10 - 6 to 1. 9 × 10 - 5 mol L- 1, respectively, using DPV and SWV methods.

40|$|Endogenous opioid {{peptides}} – enkephalins, beta-endorphin and dynorphins – {{are located}} in specific sites of the brain, the spinal cord, the autonomic ganglia and the enteric nervous system. Endogenous opioids participate in the regulation of nervous visceral afference and sensitivity {{as well as of}} several visceral motor function induced by the central nervous system and through the enteroenteric and the myoenteric reflexes. Their final effect on gut physiology is the net and harmonically balanced result of their binding to mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor subtypes. Exogenous opioid receptor ligands with different affinities for the opioid receptor subtypes have been effectively used to modify and normalize altered gut functions. Themureceptor agonists – morphine and, to a greater extent, the meperidine congeners diphenoxylate and loperamide – have been shown to slow gastrointestinal transit by their effects on the circular and longitudinal muscle of the intestine. Diphenoxylate and, more efficiently, loperamide, for the lack of any effect on the central nervous system, have been usefully employed in the treatment of diarrhea in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Unlike the mu receptor agonists morphine and loperamide, which invariably stimulate colonic motility, <b>trimebutine,</b> which has almost equal affinity for mu, delta and kappa receptors, has no effect on normal colonic activity but reduces the abnormal increase in postprandial motor activity in IBS patients and accelerates slow large bowel transit in constipated patients. Opioid ligands can be usefully employed to normalize altered visceral sensitivity in IBS patients. The kappa receptor agonist fedotozine exerts its antinociceptive effect by acting on peripheral nerve endings of sensory vagal and nonvagal afferent pathways.

Case report We report {{the case of a}} 23 year old female patient, who has a medical history of mildly active ulcerative colitis treated with mesalamine (Pentasa ®). She had no relevant past surgical history. The patient was evaluated in allergy consultation for a recent generalized facial maculo-papular exanthema associated with dysphonia, dysphagia and mild dyspnea that occurred 6 months ago. In fact, this systemic reaction appeared half an hour after taking Spasfon ®, paracetamol, loperamide and a cough syrup containing codeine (Polery ®), during an influenza-like illness with gastroenteritis. She then presented to the emergency department where she was given intravenous H 1 antihistamine plus a single intravenous corticosteroid dose (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg). Dysphonia, dysphagia and dyspnea improved successfully and she was discharged on oral antihistamine and corticosteroid for 5 days. The facial skin eruption disappeared slowly over 3 e 4 days. All drugs that have been taken are known to cause allergic reactions as side effects. Also, children and adult can commonly develop urticaria as a result of viral respiratory infections. 2 As this systemic reaction can evoke an immunological IgE mediated mechanism, we decided to test all drugs that were taken on that day. An allergic food reaction is unlikely, given the absence of food intake for at least 6 h before the reaction, and the absence of ingestion of unusual foods within the 24 h before the reaction.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a common, costly, {{and difficult}} to treat disorder that impairs health-related {{quality of life and}} work productivity. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have been unable to provide guidance on the effects of acupuncture for IBS because the only previous systematic review included only small, heterogeneous and methodologically unsound trials. The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for treating IBS. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and the Chinese databases Sino-Med, CNKI, and VIP were searched through November 2011. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, other active treatments, or no (specific) treatment, and RCTs that evaluated acupuncture as an adjuvant to another treatment, in adults with IBS were included. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We extracted data for the outcomes overall IBS symptom severity and health-related quality of life. For dichotomous data (e. g. the IBS Adequate Relief Question), we calculated a pooled relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for substantial improvement in symptom severity after treatment. For continuous data (e. g. the IBS Severity Scoring System), we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95 % CI in post-treatment scores between groups. Seventeen RCTs (1806 participants) were included. Five RCTs compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. The risk of bias in these studies was low. We found no evidence of an improvement with acupuncture relative to sham (placebo) acupuncture for symptom severity (SMD - 0. 11, 95 % CI - 0. 35 to 0. 13; 4 RCTs; 281 patients) or quality of life (SMD = - 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 27 to 0. 22; 3 RCTs; 253 patients). Sensitivity analyses based on study quality did not change the results. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes in the sham controlled trials was moderate due to sparse data. The risk of bias in the four Chinese language comparative effectiveness trials that compared acupuncture with drug treatment was high due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias in the other studies that did not use a sham control was high due to lack of blinding or inadequate methods used for randomization and allocation concealment or both. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than pharmacological therapy and no specific treatment. Eighty-four per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 63 % of patients in the pharmacological treatment group (RR 1. 28, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 45; 5 studies, 449 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to a high risk of bias (no blinding) and sparse data. Sixty-three per cent of patients in the acupuncture group had improvement in symptom severity compared to 34 % of patients in the no specific therapy group (RR 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 3. 79; 2 studies, 181 patients). There was no statistically significant difference between acupuncture and Bifidobacterium (RR 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 90 to 1. 27; 2 studies; 181 patients) or between acupuncture and psychotherapy (RR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 87 to 1. 26; 1 study; 100 patients). Acupuncture as an adjuvant to another Chinese medicine treatment was significantly better than the other treatment alone. Ninety-three per cent of patients in the adjuvant acupuncture group improved compared to 79 % of patients who received Chinese medicine alone (RR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 33; 4 studies; 466 patients). There was one adverse event (i. e. acupuncture syncope) associated with acupuncture in the 9 trials that reported this outcome, although relatively small sample sizes limit the usefulness of these safety data. Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of acupuncture relative to a credible sham acupuncture control for IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life. In comparative effectiveness Chinese trials, patients reported greater benefits from acupuncture than from two antispasmodic drugs (pinaverium bromide and <b>trimebutine</b> maleate), both of which have been shown to provide a modest benefit for IBS. Future trials may help clarify whether or not these reportedly greater benefits of acupuncture relative to pharmacological therapies are due entirely to patients' preferences for acupuncture or greater expectations of improvement on acupuncture relative to drug therapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
