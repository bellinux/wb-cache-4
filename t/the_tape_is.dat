5|$|Raj asks Chauthrani to {{take his}} case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer (Paresh Rawal). Initially, {{the bulk of the}} {{evidence}} is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice mail to the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power and status, but when he could not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.|$|E

25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

Snake asks {{how he feels about}} the people who died saving him, but the President only offers half-hearted regret. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers Snake a job, which he refuses. The President's speech commences, and he offers the contents of the cassette; to his embarrassment, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> Cabbie's cassette of the swing song [...] "Bandstand Boogie". As Snake walks away, he intentionally tears the magnetic tape out of the cassette reel with the actual message that was intended to be delivered by the President.|$|E

500|$|Most horses {{only need}} quality forage, water, and a salt or mineral block. Grain or other {{concentrates}} {{are often not}} necessary. [...] But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume. [...] For example, [...] of oats has a different volume than [...] of corn. When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead {{of one or two}} large ones. [...] However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one. To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight. [...] The tape measures the circumference of the horse's barrel, just behind the withers and elbows, and <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight.|$|E

500|$|Carpenter was {{interested}} in creating two distinct looks for the movie. [...] "One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England". Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, {{who was at the}} time a special effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Cameron {{was also one of the}} directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, there are three screens on his control panel displaying wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> visible and appears to be a 3D wireframe animation.|$|E
500|$|Rachel (Lea Michele) confides in Jesse (Jonathan Groff) of her lifelong {{dream to}} {{discover}} the identity of her mother. While they are searching through boxes of records from her basement, Jesse takes a cassette tape from his jacket and pretends that {{it came from the}} box. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> labeled as a message from mother to daughter. Rachel refuses to listen to the tape, stating that she is not ready. Jesse later meets with Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, who reveals that she is Rachel's biological mother, but a contractual agreement with Rachel's two fathers prevents her from meeting with Rachel until Rachel is 18. Jesse reveals that though he had [...] "befriended" [...] Rachel just to get more acting practice, he had actually started liking her. She implores Jesse to convince Rachel to listen to the tape. Back at Rachel's house, Jesse starts the tape playing as Rachel enters her bedroom, then leaves her to listen to it. On the tape, Shelby sings [...] "I Dreamed a Dream", leading to a duet with Rachel in a dream sequence, ending with Rachel back in her room in tears.|$|E
500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E
5000|$|There were several, I am remembering about 6, <b>tape</b> drives. But <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> not on reels. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> itself <b>was</b> {{two inches}} wide and a drive (by engaging/disengaging two {{different}} pressure rollers on capstans) could fairly quickly start <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> moving in either direction. I think there were 12 tracks on <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> and something like 50 feet of tape on each drive. <b>The</b> <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> pulled from a glass-walled vacuum column on one side to a similar column on the other, and just piled up in the column: Thus {{there was very little}} mass to accelerate or decelerate, mostly <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> itself at <b>the</b> head and for a few feet on either side.

500|$|The Mellotron has {{a similar}} {{behaviour}} to a sampler, but generates its sound via audio tape. When a key is pressed, a tape connected to it is pushed against a playback head, like a tape recorder. While the key remains depressed, <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> drawn over the head, and a sound is played. When the key is released, a spring pulls the tape back to its original position. A variety of sounds {{are available on the}} instrument. On earlier models, the instrument is split into [...] "lead" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] sections. There is a choice of six [...] "stations" [...] of rhythm sounds, each containing three rhythm tracks and three fill tracks. The fill tracks can also be mixed together. Similarly, there is a choice of six lead stations, each containing three lead instruments which can be mixed. In the centre of the Mellotron, there is a tuning button that allows a variation in both pitch and tempo. Later models do not have the concept of stations and have a single knob to select a sound, along with the tuning control. However, the frame containing the tapes is designed to be removed, and replaced with one with different sounds.|$|E
500|$|Shelby Corcoran is {{introduced}} in the fourteenth episode of the series as the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. New Directions' director, Will (Matthew Morrison), {{on a visit to}} Carmel High School, meets Shelby and they end up at his apartment making out, but Will is unable to continue and tells her about his relationship problems. Shelby suggests that as Will had been with Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) since he was fifteen and has immediately moved on to a new relationship, he ought to take some time out for himself. She later observes as New Directions' star singer, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and Vocal Adrenaline's Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) kiss, and exchanges knowing looks with Jesse. In [...] "Dream On", Rachel confides in Jesse of her lifelong dream to discover the identity of her mother.
