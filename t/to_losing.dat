25|$|The desire <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> {{weight is}} highly {{correlated}} with poor body image, with {{more women than men}} wanting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight.

5|$|In May or June 1820, Anna Cooke, an {{unmarried}} planter's daughter {{in her early}} 30s, claimed that Sharp {{was the father of}} her illegitimate child; Sharp denied her claim. The stillborn child was rumored to have dark skin, and some speculated that it was a mulatto, with a black father. After her father's death and the sale of their plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, Cooke had moved with her mother and siblings to Warren County between 1805 and 1810, when she may have met Sharp. In addition <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> the child, Cooke suffered the deaths of three of her five brothers between 1818 and 1821.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> {{all of its}} Torah scrolls, Beth Israel {{lost all}} its furniture, and over 3,000 siddurs and mahzors, {{and almost all of}} its members' homes were flooded, forcing them to move. The congregation did, however, receive assistance in replacing some of its assets; the Orthodox Union immediately sent Beth Israel 50 ArtScroll siddurs, and Brith Shalom Beth Israel Congregation of Charleston, South Carolina, and Congregation Shaare Zedek Sons of Abraham of Providence, Rhode Island each donated Torahs. Hayley Fields, a 14-year-old from Los Angeles, heard of Beth Israel's difficult circumstances, and with the support of her mother, spearheaded a fund-raising drive, selling 3,500 watches. $18,000 was ultimately raised to buy a Torah, which was dedicated in August, 2006, two days before {{the first anniversary of the}} hurricane. At that ceremony the National Council of Young Israel also donated 150 new Artscoll mahzors, in time for the High Holy Days.|$|E

In August 2012, she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms, set by celebrities. She was criticized in blogs and social media for criticizing an aspect of popular culture she helped establish. Min said the magazine was responding to reader interests, not creating them.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} {{finding of}} this study was that level of education was found to be associated to ever trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and engaging in exercise <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Interestingly, those having low level of education were more likely than those having high level of education to report ever trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and participating in exercise <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight. Contrary findings {{have been reported in the}} general population in which the perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight increased with increasing level of education (Bish et al. 2005; Kruger et al. 2004; Serdula et al. 1999). Inconsistent associations between level of education and perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and adopting weight management behaviours have been reported in diabetes populations. While some studies have reported the perception of trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight and participation in weight management behaviours, to increase with increasing educational levels (Agborsangaya et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2009), others have either reported findings similar to ours (Gurka et al. 2006) or have found no association at all (Dorsey and Songer 2011).|$|R

5|$|Morris was rested for the {{following}} match against Leicestershire, so Barnes partnered Brown {{at the top of}} the order. The pair put on 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a leg before wicket (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a clear error. Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from spinners, and bowled four overs without success in the second innings. The Australians proceeded to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and Barnes as Australia came closest <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> a match for the whole tour. The tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory—effectively seven wickets down with one injured player—before scraping home to win by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, London and Kendrick made an {{appearance}} in Dragon Gate USA, where Kendrick had already appeared in singles competition.

5|$|Overclaiming of aerial {{victories}} was not uncommon, {{and both}} sides claimed more aircraft shot down than was the case. For the 18 August action, British propaganda claimed 144 German aircraft destroyed, which was over twice the actual figure. In response, the Germans claimed they had only lost 36, a figure which has since been proven to be half the actual figure (69 to 71). The German propaganda elements claimed to have destroyed 147 British aircraft, which was over twice the actual figure. Again, the British admitted <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> only 23, when the actual figure was around 68. Other sources between them insist the RAF's losses were 27–34 fighters destroyed, and 29 aircraft destroyed on the ground, including only eight fighters.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{nutrition}} and ingredients information, included in the food labels, as useful tools for individuals who are trying <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{examined}} whether {{factors associated}} with attempting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight in a hospital-based employee workforce varied by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 6 hospitals in a health system in central Massachusetts. The stratified random sample included 813 employees; men and and non-White employees were oversampled. The primary outcome measure was current evidence-based weight loss attempts. RESULTS: Factors positively associated with attempting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight among non-Hispanic Blacks included self-perceived overweight, female sex, higher education, physician recommendation <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight, and having a chronic medical condition. Among Hispanics, body mass index and self-perceived overweight were associated with attempts <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight, while working full time and second or third shift were associated with lower likelihood of weight loss attempts. Among non-Hispanic Whites, self-perceived overweight, female sex, higher education, and physician recommendation <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight were positively associated with attempting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight, while working full time and working third shift were negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of overweight and obesity were high among hospital employees. Findings suggest that {{factors associated with}} attempting <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight vary across racial and ethnic groups. Workplace-based interventions for weight control should include strategies tailored to these differences...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the competition, Jenny Roesler of Cricinfo {{suggested}} England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition. The final was a repeat of the 1993 final, when England won at Lord's. Both sides had won the World Cup previously, but only when hosting the tournament. New Zealand achieved the feat in 2000, while England were winners in both 1973 and 1993. In addition <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> the 1993 final to England, New Zealand were also finalists in 1997, losing to Australia in India. England had contested five previous finals; losing to Australia in subsequent tournaments in 1978, 1982 and 1988. England all-rounder Gunn aggravated a calf-strain during the warm-up, and was replaced by the team's vice-captain Nicky Shaw, who had previously been omitted from the side. Huw Richards, writing for the International Herald Tribune, described both England and New Zealand as worthy finalists, and noted that he was disappointed with the performance of Australia, who finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Rovers were {{admitted}} to the Football League in 1920 and have played there ever since, apart from spending the 2014–15 season in the Conference Premier.

5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Loxton bowled only one over, which was a maiden, before pulling his groin while trying to attain more pace, as the hosts were bowled out for 71. He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory. Australia came closest <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat, before scraping home without further loss, although both batsmen at the crease survived chances. Due to his injury, Loxton was rested {{for the next two}} matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University. Australia won both matches by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Bola {{created some}} of the {{heaviest}} rainfall totals for a single storm {{in the history of}} New Zealand, with some locations receiving more than half of their annual rainfall totals from the storm. While the cyclone passed north of the island, a strong easterly flow over the North Island contained the interaction between moist air from Bola and drier air from the ridge to its southeast. In the Gisborne region, the flow resulted in the heaviest rainfall totals, when the moisture ascended over the region's western mountainous areas and condensed into precipitation. One station recorded 419mm (16.5in) in a 24‑hour period. The maximum rainfall total attributed to the storm was 917mm (36.1in), reported at a station near Tolaga Bay. Heavy rainfall totals of up to and over 300mm (12in) were observed in the regions of Auckland and Northland. The cyclone is the largest to be recorded in 93years of rainfall records. As such, it had a large and lasting effect on the rivers of the area when it deposited a large amount of sediment, as recorded in the sedimentary record of Lake Tūtira. Shortly prior <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> its identity, the remnants of Bola also dropped 100–200mm (4–8in) of precipitation on the South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
