40|$|We {{present some}} {{results on the}} effect of initial buffer layer on the {{crystalline}} quality of Cubic GaN epitaxial layers grown on GaAs(100) substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Photoluminescence and Hall measurements were performed to characterize the electrical and optical properties of cubic GaN. The crystalline quality subsequently grown high-temperature (HT) cubic GaN layers strongly depended on thermal effects during the <b>temperature</b> <b>ramping</b> process after low temperature (LT) growth of the buffer layers. Atomic force microscope (AFM) and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) were employed to investigate this <b>temperature</b> <b>ramping</b> process. Furthermore, the role of thermal treatment during the <b>temperature</b> <b>ramping</b> process was identified. Using the optimum buffer layer, the full width at half maxim (FWHM) at room temperature photoluminescence 5. 6 nm was achieved. To our knowledge, this is the best FWHM value for cubic GaN to date.

In this work, the effect of <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate on flip-chip anisotropically conductive adhesive joint quality and reliability has been studied. The experiments were performed on bumped and unbumped die. They were assembled onto bare ITO-glass and FR- 4 substrates. The reason for using the transparent glass substrate is that the particle deformation and settlement can be visualised without destroying the assembled module. The <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rates studied ranged between 8. 1 and 65. 7 °C/s. The experiments show that the best joint quality is obtained when a slow <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate is applied to unbumped dies. A good joint is achieved when many particles have been entrapped on the die pad and when there is a significant degree of particle deformation. A large degree of deformation of particles results in a large contact area for the electrical conduction path. When a high <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate is applied, there is a risk that the adhesive is already cured before full compression is reached. This will prevent the particles in the adhesive from contacting the bonding surface. When assembling bumped die, the <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate {{does not seem to have}} a significant influence on the result. The joint quality evaluation has been performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Microscopy (OM). Furthermore, temperature cycling between - 40 to + 125 °C, 1000 cycles, has been performed to characterise the joint reliability under the optimum <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate conditions. The electrical resistance has been measured continuously. A theoretical simulation of the influence of the <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate on the adhesive joint quality has been performed using the same test module conditions as for the experimental work. The results coincide with the experimental results, particularly in the range of low bonding pressure value...|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{compounds}} {{of interest}} for peaks in data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) is a critical analytical task. Manually identifying compounds is tedious and time-consuming. An alternative is to use pattern matching. Pattern matching identifies compounds by matching previously observed patterns with known peaks to newly observed patterns with unidentified peaks. The fundamental difficulty of pattern matching comes from peak pattern distortions that are caused by differences in data acquisition conditions. This paper investigates peak pattern variations related to varying oven <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate and inlet gas pressure and evaluates two types of affine transformations for matching peak patterns. The experimental results suggest that, over the experimental ranges, the changes in <b>temperature</b> <b>ramp</b> rate generate non-linear pattern variations and changes in gas pressure generate nearly linear pattern variations.

40|$|The role of <b>temperature</b> <b>ramping</b> rate {{during the}} two-step growth of GaN-on-sapphire by metalorganic {{chemical}} vapor deposition is explored. The surface morphology and crystalline properties of the low-temperature-deposited GaN buffer layer annealed under various ramping rates (20 - 60 degreesC/min) to 1000 degreesC were investigated by atomic force microscopy and X-ray measurements. For lower ramping rates employed, a dramatic re-evaporation of the GaN buffer layer might occur. This makes the buffer layer thinner, yielding a GaN epilayer of hexagonal morphology. However, as the higher ramping rates are applied, the surface becomes rougher and exhibits hexagonal three-dimensional islands. It {{could be due to}} the fact that the grains of the GaN buffer layer do not have enough time to coarsen. Under a <b>temperature</b> <b>ramping</b> rate of 40 degreesC/min, a smooth buffer-layer surface can be maintained and results in a subsequent high-quality overlayer deposition. The mirror GaN epilayer shows a near-band-edge peak (25 K) centered at 3. 477 eV with a full-width at half-maximum as narrow as 13. 1 meV. The observed temperature-ramping-rate effects can be interpreted by the coalescence mechanism of the GaN buffer layer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
