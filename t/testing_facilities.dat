5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and <b>testing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did the ASO squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E

5|$|Toxicology testing, {{also known}} as safety testing, is {{conducted}} by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal <b>testing</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, {{on behalf of a}} wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} assists the National Small Wind Turbine Centre (NSWTC) in {{the development}} of a wind turbine <b>test</b> <b>facility</b> and in preparation for the development of a future turbine testing site. The <b>test</b> turbine <b>facility</b> will conduct <b>tests</b> in accordance with relevant national and international standards. Assistance was given {{in the development}} of the <b>test</b> <b>facility</b> by the identification of some of the key areas of the initial set up of the wind turbine <b>test</b> <b>facility.</b> The clarity and adequacy of portions of current national and international standards in application to the development of a small wind turbine <b>testing</b> <b>facility</b> was assessed. By the completion of this dissertation assistance was given, which contributed to the progression of the site development aspects in establishment of the <b>test</b> <b>facility.</b> This process gave insight into some of the important factors to consider {{in the development of}} a wind turbine <b>test</b> <b>facility.</b> Participation by author in two international tasks that assessed wind turbine test data to selected standards provided exposure to the current wind turbine standards that will be applied in the testing of wind turbines at the facility. This process highlighted the lack of clarity within one of the standards and illustrated the varied results that can be produced if the assessed standards are not understood as intended. Recommendations were given on how the NSWTC might improve the method of site development of the future <b>test</b> <b>facility.</b> The assessment allowed recommendations to be made on the use of the standards and outlines how errors in their application might be avoided...|$|R
