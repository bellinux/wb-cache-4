40|$|Vertical cavity surface {{emitting}} lasers (VCSELs) {{are today}} a commodity {{on the short}} wavelength laser market due to {{the ease with which}} they are manufactured. Much effort has in the last decade been directed towards making long wavelength VCSELs as successful in the marketplace. This has not been achieved due to the much more difficult fabrication technologies needed for realising high performance long wavelength VCSELs. At one point, GaInNAs quantum wells gain regions grown on GaAs substrates seemed to be the solution as it enabled all-epitaxial VCSELs that could make use of high contrast AlGaAs-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) as mirrors and lateral selective oxidation for optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>confinement,</b> thereby mimicking the successful design of short wavelength VCSELs. Although very good device results were achieved, reproducible and reliable epitaxial growth of GaInNAs quantum wells proved difficult and the technology has not made its way into high-volume production. Other approaches to the manufacturing and material problems have been to combine mature InP-based gain regions with high contrast AlGaAs-based DBRs by wafer fusion or with high contrast dielectric DBRs. Commonly, a patterned tunnel junction provides the <b>electrical</b> <b>confinement</b> in these VCSELs. Excellent performance has been achieved in this way but the fabrication process is difficult. In this work, we have employed high strain InGaAs quantum wells along with large detuning between the gain peak and the emission wavelength to realize GaAs-based long wavelength VCSELs. All-epitaxial VCSELs with AlGaAs-based DBRs and lateral oxidation confinement were fabricated and evaluated. The efficiency of these VCSELs was limited due to the optical absorption in the doped DBRs. To improve the efficiency and manufacturability, two novel optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>confinement</b> schemes based on epitaxial regrowth of current blocking layers were developed. The first scheme is based on a single regrowth step and requires very precise processing. This scheme was therefore not developed beyond the first generation but single mode power of 0. 3 mW at low temperature, - 10 ºC, was achieved. The second scheme is based on two epitaxial regrowth steps and does not require as precise processing. Several generations of this design were manufactured and resulted in record high power of 8 mW at low temperature, 5 ºC, and more than 3 mW at high temperature, 85 ºC. Single mode power was more modest with 1. 5 mW at low temperature and 0. 8 mW at high temperature, comparable to the performance of the single mode lateral oxidation confined VCSELs. The reason for the modest single mode power was found to be a non-optimal cavity shape after the second regrowth that leads to poor lateral overlap between the gain in the quantum wells and the intensity of the optical field.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to understand and improve optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>confinement</b> to achieve cost-effective high-efficiency thin p-type Si solar cells. Optical confinement is achieved by front surface texturing in conjunction with an internal reflective layer on the back surface. <b>Electrical</b> <b>confinement</b> is obtained {{through the use of}} a high-lifetime material coupled with high-quality passivation on both surfaces. This research is divided into five tasks. In the first task, Ga-doped Cz Si was investigated to achieve a high and stable lifetime. It was found that for 1 ohm-cm nominal-resistivity screen-printed Al-back surface filed (BSF) cells, the Ga-doped ingot gave ~ 1. 5 % higher absolute efficiency after light-soaking relative to the B-doped counterpart. The benefit of using Ga is therefore quite explicit. In the second task, the screen-printed Al-BSF was investigated to explore its potential and limitations for achieving high-efficiency cells. It was found that there exists a critical alloying temperature for a given Al-thickness, above which the Al-BSF becomes non-uniform and cell performance starts to degrade. This puts a limit on the quality of the Al-BSF that can be achieved. An alternative way of back passivation involving dielectric/metal layers was therefore explored. In Task three, two key requirements for achieving high-efficiency dielectric back-passivated cells were established through device modeling. These are (1) a formation of a high-quality BSF underneath the local back contact through vias in the dielectric and (2) a high-quality dielectric passivation with either a moderate positive charge density or a high negative charge density. Task four involved the development of a metallization technique through vias in the dielectric to achieve a high-quality contact and an efficient internal reflector in conjunction with a high-quality local BSF. Further, a novel dielectric system composed of a spin-on SiO 2 layer capped with SiN x was developed that exhibited excellent passivation and a moderate positive charge density. The final task involved fabrication and analysis of dielectric back-passivated cells. The new dielectric and process sequence developed in this thesis resulted in screen-printed solar cells with efficiency as high as 19 % with the potential for 20 % efficient cells on 100 -µm thick Si substrates.
