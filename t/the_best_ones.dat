5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

500|$|The {{changes to}} the story were mostly superficial, and the {{adaptation}} generally mirrors the novella's tone. The television critic Matthew Baylis observed that the film creates unease and horror through distortions of reality, and that The Turn of the Screw is not a [...] "screaming-banshees-and-horrible-corpses style of ghost story". The film utilises subtle horror, including details such as a broken doll on a window ledge, {{and the fact that}} viewers never discover certain elements of the story (for example, it is never revealed why the character Miles has been suspended from his boarding school). This, for Baylis, ties to the title of the film: [...] "it's the writer who puts the screw in the hole and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> ask the audience to turn it themselves".|$|E

Eurogamer's Tom Brawell agreed, calling Tidus' voice [...] "whiny" [...] and [...] "detestable". Despite his dislike of the voice acting, Chris Carter of Destructoid enjoyed playing as Tidus in the crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy and looked forward to its reboot. On the other hand, PSXextreme liked Taylor's work in voicing Tidus. In the book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century, the writers recalled that Tidus' characterization differs in the original Japanese release of Final Fantasy X and its English dub; the localized version failed to emulate the original Tidus. In a Final Fantasy X scene, Yuna tells Tidus to laugh (to cheer him up) and Tidus forces a laugh. Although fans criticised the laughter as too forced, Taylor {{said that it was}} supposed to sound like that and they should [...] "get over it".

Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want to look away, and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as [...] "a masterpiece of death and destruction" [...] even if he only watched the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the [...] "intense, impactful first episode" [...] despite his feeling that it has [...] "limited animation".

Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment highly praised Kenshin's characterization in the manga due to his seriousness as well how he intends to tell his friends his feelings contrasting some episodes from the anime where Kenshin is more comical. Lavey also highly praised the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime in the manga's seventh volume and Kenshin's killing intent displayed against his rival. Similarly, his first fight against Saito in the anime adaptation earned high praise by Anime News Network writer Mark A. Grey considering one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ones</b> from the series.

Anime Reviews website criticized Kenshin's super deformed appearance in comedy scenes claiming it does not suit the context of the character or the series. Mania.com remarks that Kenshin has a [...] "smartass" [...] attitude in a review of volume 8; while they noted that is a common attitude in the anime that makes him look out-of-character. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol praised Kenshin for being a character that all people enjoy watching due to his comedy scenes.

The character's ending in The King of Fighters '97 has been considered by 1UP.com as one of the strangest parts of the story. However, they considered his winning quotations and appearance as one of the best creations of SNK, commenting that the company had been unable to make such an appealing character until K′'s introduction. Lucke M. Albiges from Eurogamer praised Iori, along with Kyo, as having one of the most unpredictable appearances in the series, and considered him a veteran character. In the top ten fighting games from GameTrailers, Iori has been called one of the main innovative figures from the series, from his introduction in The King of Fighters '95 through his development in the following games. Some commentators found his recurring interactions with Kyo Kusanagi during fights d to be appealing, adding depth to the games, despite the fact English gamers are not able to understand them, and some lack a storyline. The character's new design from The King of Fighters XII has been well received by GameSpot writer Andrew Park who found such moves interesting. On the other hand, 1UP.com writer Richard Li; Li complained about the lack of Iori's signature moves such as his fireballs, and while some of them remained, Li noted that they now require a different input from the ones they normally require. Kevin S. from GameRevolution liked the interactions between Kyo and Iori in The King of Fighters XIV as it was one of the most famous parts from the series similarly to Feit. The Orochi form from Iori was listed as the sixth best altered video game character alongside Leona's based on the impact both have on the storyline by Den of Geek. The same site also listed him as the fourth best King of Fighters characters based on his moves, rivalry with Kyo as well as apparent character arc based on how he retakes his lost powers in KOF XIII and used them in KOF XIV to once again seal Orochi.|$|E
