5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{made in the}} Resolutions and the Report {{were later}} used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832, when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison rejected the concept of nullification {{and the notion that}} his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Dalton Ross {{named the}} episode {{as one of}} the season's best, commending the fact that [...] "most of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> were {{actually}} answered," [...] unlike the season finale of Lost. He praised the Bree storyline as well as the conclusion to the Mary Alice mystery, calling it [...] "both shocking and satisfying." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale, writing: [...] "'Desperate Housewives' is willing to answer some of its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure. 'Lost,' heading into its own two-hour finale this Wednesday, is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers." [...] Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that [...] "by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries, yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others, 'Desperate Housewives' has smartly set things up for its audience to return for its new season next fall." [...] Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale [...] "a smashing close" [...] to the first season. Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved, {{as well as in the}} Betty Applewhite character. He also theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: [...] "Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body. When has Desperate Housewives exercised restraint without an ulterior motive?" ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E
2500|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> in the lead-up {{to the war}} {{was whether}} the United Nations Security Council would authorize {{military}} intervention in Iraq. It became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections. Many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. Robin Cook, then {{the leader of the}} United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet in protest over the UK's decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: [...] "In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britain's interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} two rounds, a {{question}} with two choices was presented, usually about the children (e.g., [...] "Would you rather watch T.V. {{or go to the}} movies?" [...] or [...] "Do men or women make better drivers?"). The contestants secretly predicted how the majority of the children answered that question. The first contestant then selected one of the children, at which point Shriner read a just-for-fun <b>question</b> related to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>question,</b> {{which may or may not}} provide a clue to the child's answer of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> contestant then guessed the child's response to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> child's answer was then played, and if the contestant predicted correctly, he/she scored points.

2500|$|The obscure {{nature of}} the Organization's {{activities}} throughout Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II led reviewers to describe them as an [...] "ominous" [...] group that [...] "seems to be intent on guiding Sora and his friends to accomplish some dark purpose". Similarly, Rice Burner of GamePro emphasizes this plot when reviewing the group's debut, noting how the [...] "strange inhabitants of the castle trap our heroes" [...] and [...] "force Sora on a ponderous journey into his own memories to face his subconscious thoughts and fears". This mysterious perception is furthered {{by the fact that}} some members of Organization XIII present themselves as dark silhouettes with their faces covered, acting as an [...] "enigmatic robed and cowled figure speaking in riddles". The questions surrounding the groups motivation and purpose have created great curiosity among players; Andrew Reiner of Game Informer included [...] "What secret lies behind Organization XIII?" [...] as one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> that are answered and that serve as plot devices in Kingdom Hearts II, creating situations that [...] "certainly give you shivers and make your heart leap". Visually, the artwork of Organization XIII's members is based more on the styles of Final Fantasy rather than those of Disney. Bethany Massimilla of GameSpot referred to their models as [...] "very much cut from the Final Fantasy spiky-haired cloth".|$|E

Or were the unions of the sexes originally shifting and precarious, so that the wisest child was not expected to know his own father, and family ties were reckoned through the mother alone? Again (setting aside {{the question of what}} was 'primitive' and 'original'), did the needs and barbarous habits of early men lead to a scarcity of women, and hence to polyandry (that is, the marriage of one woman to several men), with the consequent uncertainty about male parentage?

To him all the mighty pomp and all the little squabbles of office were, he said, as nothing. He would never allow himself to regard {{the person of the}} Prime Minister. The measure before the House ever had been and ever should be all in all to him. If the public weal were more {{regarded}} in that House, and the quarrels of men less considered, he thought that the service of the country would be better done. He was answered by Mr. Monk, who was sitting near him, and who intended to support Mr. Gresham. Mr. Monk was rather happy in pulling his old friend, Mr. Turnbull, to pieces, expressing his opinion that a difference in men meant a difference in measures. The characters of men whose principles were known were guarantees for the measures they would advocate. To him,--Mr. Monk,--it was matter of very great moment who was Prime Minister of England. He was always selfish enough to wish for a Minister with whom he himself could agree on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions</b> of the day.

They do not tend much if at all to tables d'hôte, but the Italians and the French who do, serve you a better meal for a lower price than you would get in Paris, or Rome, or Naples. There the {{prevalent}} ideal is five francs, with neither wine nor coffee included. I'll allow that the cheap table d'hôte is mainly the affair of single men and women, and does not merit the consideration I've given it. If it helps a young couple to do with one maid, or with none, instead of two, it makes for cheapness of living. Service is costly and it is greedy, and except in large households its diet {{is the same as the}} family's, so that anything which reduces it is a great saving. But the table d'hôte which is cheap for one or two is not cheap for more, and it is not available if there are children. Housing and raw-provisioning and serving are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>questions,</b> and in Europe the first and last are apparently much less expensive. Marketing is undoubtedly cheaper with us, and if you count in what you get with the newness, the wholesomeness, and handiness of an American flat, the rent is not so much greater than that of a European flat, with its elementary bareness. You could not, here, unless you descended from the apartment to the tenement, hire any quarter where you would not be supplied with hot and cold water, with steam heating, with a bath-room, and all the rest of it." ...|$|E
