5|$|Though clearly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> whales of {{the genus}} Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus. More recently, though, DNA sequencing analysis has indicated the humpback is {{more closely related to}} certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly to the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to other rorquals such as the minke whales.|$|E
5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> planets, comets {{are subject to}} further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatch {{taxonomy}} is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted nuthatch has {{an appearance}} and contact call {{similar to those}} of the white-cheeked nuthatch, Sitta leucopsis, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> nuthatch (S. magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} {{have taken a}} lead in designating protected areas in South America. In 2004, Peru created {{one of the largest}} conservation areas in the world, Alto Purús National Park, with an area similar in size to Belgium.

Bolivia designated wetlands larger than the size of Switzerland as a freshwater protected area in 2001; these are also home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> otter.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System is home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region.

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{considered}} a living fossil and only distantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally {{more closely related to}} {{the other members of the}} superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been {{previously}} placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, {{which is part of}} the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> panda, which is a basal ursid.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant,</b> suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} members of the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna, {{diminutive}} in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> sauropods. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining gallery forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Othnielosaurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2-5.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> planets will be influenced {{in a different}} way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Ward helps Quatermass and Fowler gain {{entry to}} the plant and they find that Dillon has been {{discharged}} from the infirmary and has left. They then look around and discover that gases are pumped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> pressure domes from the pilot plant: ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, as opposed to oxygen as in Quatermass' moonbase pressure dome idea. Meanwhile, the guards intimidate and then murder a family who were having a picnic nearby. Back at the plant, Ward slips away to look inside a dome, and Quatermass and Fowler find him stumbling out of it dying and covered in black slime, which before his death Ward reveals was inside the dome instead of food. Fowler and Quatermass escape back to the Rocket Group and analyse Ward's tie with Leo and Paula, finding that the slime is a corrosive, poisonous substance, fatal to all forms of life on Earth. Meanwhile, the asteroid is approaching its near point.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{form of the}} Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD. The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>giant</b> metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, Uaxactun, Río Azul and ElZapote, all in the Petén Department of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king YaxNuunAyiinI, from there it spread to his vassal cities. In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by YaxNuunAyiinI's son SiyajChanK'awiilII, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands. Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example {{in the form of}} Teotihuacan war emblems. His Stela31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb. It depicts the crowning of SiyajChanK'awiilII, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style. On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican atlatl spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc. The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the Teotihuacan invasion that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.|$|E
