40|$|Web {{applications}} {{have become}} an integral part of the daily lives of millions of users. Unfortunately, web applications are also frequently targeted by attackers, and attacks such as XSS and SQL injection are still common. In this paper, we present an empirical study of more than 7000 input validation vulnerabilities with the aim of gaining deeper insights into how these common web vulnerabilities can be prevented. In particular, we focus on the relationship between the specific programming language used to develop web applications and the vulnerabilities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> commonly <b>reported.</b> <b>Our</b> findings suggest that most SQL injection and a significant number of XSS vulnerabilities can be prevented using straight-forward validation mechanisms based on common data types. We elaborate on these common data types, and discuss how support could be provided in web application frameworks.

40|$|Abstract Background Whole genome {{sequencing}} (WGS) {{is already being}} used in certain clinical and research settings, but its impact on patient well-being, health-care utilization, and clinical decision-making remains largely unstudied. It is also unknown how best to communicate sequencing results to physicians and patients to improve health. We describe {{the design of the}} MedSeq Project: the first randomized trials of WGS in clinical care. Methods/Design This pair of randomized controlled trials compares WGS to standard of care in two clinical contexts: (a) disease-specific genomic medicine in a cardiomyopathy clinic and (b) general genomic medicine in primary care. We are recruiting 8 to 12 cardiologists, 8 to 12 primary care physicians, and approximately 200 of their patients. Patient participants in both the cardiology and primary care trials are randomly assigned to receive a family history assessment with or without WGS. Our laboratory delivers a genome report to physician participants that balances the needs to enhance understandability of genomic information and to convey its complexity. We provide an educational curriculum for physician participants and offer them a hotline to genetics professionals for guidance in interpreting and managing their patients’ genome reports. Using varied data sources, including surveys, semi-structured interviews, and review of clinical data, we measure the attitudes, behaviors and outcomes of physician and patient participants at multiple time points before and after the disclosure of these results. Discussion The impact of emerging sequencing technologies on patient care is unclear. We have designed a process of interpreting WGS results and delivering them to physicians in a way that anticipates how we envision genomic medicine will evolve in the near future. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>our</b> WGS <b>report</b> provides clinically relevant information while communicating the complexity and uncertainty of WGS results to physicians and, through physicians, to their patients. This project will not only illuminate the impact of integrating genomic medicine into the clinical care of patients but also inform the design of future studies.

40|$|How do {{neuronal}} {{populations in}} the auditory cortex represent acoustic stimuli? Although sound-evoked neural responses in the anesthetized auditory cortex are mainly transient, recent experiments in the unanesthetized preparation have emphasized subpopulations with other response properties. To quantify the relative contributions of these different sub{{populations in the}} awake preparation, we have estimated the representation of sounds across the neuronal population using a representative ensemble of stimuli. We used cell-attached recording with a glass electrode, a method for which single-unit isolation {{does not depend on}} neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. We find that the population response is sparse, with stimuli typically eliciting high firing rates (. 20 spikes/second) in less than 5 % of neurons at any instant. Some neurons had very low spontaneous firing rates (, 0. 01 spikes/second). At the other extreme, some neurons had driven rates in excess of 50 spikes/second. Interestingly, the overall population response was well described by a lognormal distribution, rather than the exponential distribution <b>that</b> <b>is</b> often <b>reported.</b> <b>Our</b> results represent, to our knowledge, the first quantitative evidence for sparse representations of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex. <b>Our</b> results <b>are</b> compatible with a model in which most neurons are silent much of the time, and in which representations are composed of small dynamic subsets of highly active neurons...|$|R

In short, fiscal year 2005 was an exceptional year for GAO. For example, we received a clean opinion from independent auditors on our financial statements and met or exceeded targets for 10 of 14 key performance measures, while setting or matching all-time records for 3 measures. We documented $ 39. 6 billion in financial benefits [...] a return of $ 83 for every dollar we spent [...] and over 1, 400 nonfinancial benefits [...] a record for us. The work we did to produce these benefits helped to shape important legislation, such as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Pub. L.

40|$|Dennett argues <b>that</b> we can <b>be</b> mistaken about <b>our</b> own {{conscious}} experience. Despite this, {{he repeatedly}} asserts {{that we can}} or do have unchallengeable authority of some sort in <b>our</b> <b>reports</b> about that experience. This assertion takes three forms. First, Dennett compares our authority {{to the authority of}} an author over his fictional world. Unfortunately, that appears to involve denying <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> actual facts about experience <b>that</b> subjects may <b>be</b> truly or falsely reporting. Second, Dennett sometimes seems to say that even though we may be mistaken about what <b>our</b> conscious experience <b>is,</b> <b>our</b> <b>reports</b> about “what it’s like to be us ” must <b>be</b> correct. <b>That</b> view unfortunately requires a nonstandard and (by Dennett) unremarked distinction between facts about consciousness and facts about “what it’s like”. Third, Dennett says that reports about experience may <b>be</b> “incorrigible”.
