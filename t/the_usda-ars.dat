5000|$|Numerous highbush cultivars of {{blueberries}} are available, with {{diversity among}} them, each having individual qualities. A blueberry breeding {{program has been}} established by <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> breeding program at Beltsville, Maryland, and Chatsworth, New Jersey. This program began when Frederick Vernon Coville of <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> collaborated with Elizabeth Coleman White of New Jersey. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, White offered pineland residents cash for wild blueberry plants with unusually large fruit. [...] After 1910 Coville began to work on blueberry, and was the first to discover the importance of soil acidity (blueberries need highly acidic soil), that blueberries do not self-pollinate, and the effects of cold on blueberries and other plant. In 1911, he began a program of research in conjunction with White, daughter of the owner of the extensive cranberry bogs at Whitesbog in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. His work doubled the size of some strains' fruit, and by 1916, he had succeeded in cultivating blueberries, making them a valuable crop in the Northeastern United States. For this work he received the George Roberts White Medal of Honor from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.|$|E
50|$|Semi-erect, prickle-free {{blackberries}} {{were first}} {{developed at the}} John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK, and subsequently by <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> in Beltsville, Maryland.

Cultivars include 'Black Satin' 'Chester Thornless', 'Dirksen Thornless', 'Hull Thornless', 'Loch Maree', 'Loch Ness', 'Loch Tay', 'Merton Thornless', 'Smoothstem', and 'Triple Crown'. The cultivar 'Cacanska Bestrna' (also called 'Cacak Thornless') has been developed in Serbia and has been planted on many thousands of hectares there.|$|E

In 1995, he became the director of the Biological Control Laboratory USDA-ARS for Brisbane, Australia, where he led the fight against Melaleuca quinquenervia, an invasive plant in the Florida Everglades.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative {{was founded}} in 1998.

50|$|Twenty-five diverse corn {{lines were}} {{chosen as the}} parental lines for the NAM {{population}} in order to encompass the remarkable diversity of maize and preserve historic linkage disequilibrium. Each parental line was crossed to the B73 maize inbred (chosen as a reference line due to its use in the public maize sequencing project and wide deployment {{as one of the}} most successful commercial inbred lines) to create the F1 population. The F1 plants were then self-fertilized for six generations in order to create a total of 200 homozygous recombinant inbred lines (RILs) per family, for a total of 5000 RILs within the NAM population. The lines are publicly available through <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> Maize Stock Center.|$|E
50|$|The olallieberry (pronounced oh-la-leh, {{sometimes}} spelled ollalieberry, olallaberry, olalliberry, ollalaberry or ollaliberry) is {{the marketing}} {{name for the}} 'Olallie' blackberry released by <b>the</b> <b>USDA-ARS</b> (in collaboration with Ore. St. University) that was a selection from a cross between the 'Black Logan' (syn. 'Mammoth'), developed by Judge James Logan in California, and the youngberry, which was developed by Byrnes M. Young in Louisiana. According to Logan, 'Black Logan' was from a cross between the eastern blackberry 'Crandall' and the western dewberry 'Aughinbaugh'. 'Youngberry' was from a cross of 'Phenomenal' x 'Austin Mayes'. 'Phenomenal' in turn is a cross of the 'Aughinbaugh' western dewberry and 'Cuthbert' red raspberry and so has a very similar background to Logan's 'Loganberry' and shares a parent with his 'Black Logan'.|$|E
