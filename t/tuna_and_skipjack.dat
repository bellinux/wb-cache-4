40|$|Together with cost {{inflation}} and stagnant market prices, the new 200 -nautical-mile regime {{has hit the}} conventional <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> fishing industry very hard. Japanese countermeasures consist of domestic adjustments such as cost and risk-reducing devices, withdrawals of fishing vessels, employment of purse-seine fisheries, nearshore fishing ground adjustments, and demand expansion; and external strategies such as historical fishing rights, legal-Informal Composite Negotiating Text (ICNT), and bilateral arrangements. The Japanese claim on historical <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> fishing rights in the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific is based on 1) discovery of the fishing grounds by the Japanese, 2) risk-taking for development by the Japanese, 3) continuous and habitual Japanese fishing activities in the region, 4) long legal practices under the Japanese fisheries licensing system, and 5) {{the importance of the}} fishery. Although most coastal nations in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific treat <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> in their EEZs as their national properties, the position of the ICNT emphasizes that highly migratory species such as <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> are managed by cooperation among the countries concerned and international cooperation is essential to manage those fishery wisely. Bilateral arrangements such as fee fishing and joint-ventures, associated with overseas cooperation, have been successful in terms of fishing access to the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in the region, but current arrangements become increasingly difficult due to coastal nations' desires to increase fishing fees and take part in joint-ventures. Emergence of subregional management schemes will become more important for dealing with highly migratory species like <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack,</b> but Japan is not yet ready for such schemes. The legal, political, and economic constraints on each of the strategies are numerous and combine to aggravate the problem. Although the Japanese government has committed to easing the adjustment of Japanese fishermen to the new ocean regime, the job is not easy. The problem involves not only the Japanese, but also coastal, resource-owning nations as well. Joint arrangements have many advantages over attempts by any one nation to go it alone. However, in order to arrive at successful arrangements, it is essential for each party to understand the interests, capabilities, and limitations of the other.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to clarify issues {{concerning}} Japanese <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> fisheries in Southeast Asian seas and the South Pacific under the New Law of the Sea Regime from the International Marine Policy point of view. First, problems of the New Law of the Sea Regime are reviewed in relation to Japanese interests. These problems include geopolitical problems of the Southeast Asian seas and the South Pacific, priority, optimum allowable catch, traditional fishing right, archipelagic waters, and highly migratory species. Second, current problems of Japanese <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Skipjack</b> fisheries in the Southeast Asian seas and the South Pacific are reviewed and analyzed by using three criteria: national significance, reasons for governmental protection of special industry, and government's responsibility. Third, {{the future of the}} traditional <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> fisheries is explored in cooperation with the government's fisheries policy and overseas cooperation. Conclusions reveal that the most promising future form of traditional <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> fisheries will be the development of the industry with the development of developing countries because {{of the role of the}} industry in national security in addition to economic viability. The most important jobs of the government and other people concerned are at present: 1) adoption of a moratorum on entry into over-capitalized fisheries; 2) reconsideration of the rights to common property resources; 3) quality improvement of the Japanese people related to international fisheries; 4) marriage between natural science and social science in fisheries; 5) revision of laws related to fisheries; and 6) radical change in current overseas fisheries cooperation activites...|$|E

S. This pathogen may be introduced to pre-cooked tuna meat used for the production of canned tuna because significant manual handling occurs after cooking of the raw fish to separate the meat from the skin and bones. This study was conducted to investigate the growth and enterotoxin production of five enterotoxigenic S. aureus strains in pre-cooked albacore <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> <b>tuna</b> meat held at 37 and 27 °C, the survival of S. aureus in pre-cooked tuna meat stored at - 20 ± 2 °C for 4 weeks and its ability to grow and produce enterotoxins in the pre-cooked tuna meat at 37 °C after frozen storage, and thermal inactivation of enterotoxins in pre-cooked tuna meat at 111 and 121 °C. Frozen pre-cooked albacore <b>tuna</b> (loin, chunk <b>and</b> flake) <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> <b>tuna</b> (chunk <b>and</b> flake) obtained from a canned tuna producer were inoculated with five S. aureus strains or highly purified enterotoxins A (SEA), B (SEB), and D (SED) for this study. With an initial inoculation levels of 10 ²⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in inoculated albacore <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> <b>tuna</b> meat increased by > 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, respectively. On the other hand, more than 8 and 10 h of incubation at 27 °C were needed to yield the same increase of S. aureus counts (> 3 log CFU/g) in albacore <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> samples, respectively. However no enterotoxin was produced in any inoculated albacore or skipjack tuna samples exposed to 37 °C for 12 h or 27 °C for 16 h. S. aureus survived in pre-cooked tuna during frozen storage. With an initial inoculation level of 10 ³⁻⁴ CFU/g, populations of S. aureus in all pre-cooked tuna samples decreased slightly (< 0. 7 log CFU/g) after 4 weeks of storage at - 20 ± 2 °C. However, the populations increased rapidly once the samples were thawed and held at 37 °C. Total S. aureus counts in albacore <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> samples increased by greater than 3 log CFU/g after 6 and 8 h of exposure to 37 °C, respectively. However, no enterotoxin was detected in any samples after 10 h exposure to 37 °C. All the samples showed signs of spoilage before enterotoxin was detected. Studies of heat resistances of SEA, SEB, and SED inoculated to pre-cooked albacore <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> <b>tuna</b> meat revealed that the heat resistance of SED was stronger than SEA and SEB, particularly in albacore loin, flake <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> flake samples. When samples were inoculated with SEA, SEB and SED at levels of 500 ng/g, a thermal treatment at 121 °C for 15 min inactivated SEA and SEB in all samples and SED in albacore chunk <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> chunk but not in albacore loin, flake <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> flake samples. However, a process at 111 °C, for 60 min inactivated all SEA, SEB and SED in all tuna samples at levels of 500 ng/g.

The most representative flow of the product is such that the tuna is processed in a firm in the developing country of the tropical area where the canned material, namely <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>skipjack,</b> is caught and landed. Canned products furnish standardized features in their size, the way of cooking, added flavors and quality {{so as to be}} exported either to Europe or North America where they are used as one of the cooking material. In the end of 1990 ’s, however, a new stream of production and consumption pattern emerged in the Philippines and Thailand. Tunas are cooked by local ways with local flavors before they are canned. The products are sold in ready-to-eat styles and consumed in the produced countries. Moreover and more recently, producers started to open up a new market in China as they tries to cook tuna in Chinese way. Transnational Agribusinesses sometimes develops {{in such a way that}} a product, that used to be produced solely for the export, gradually disseminates locally as per-capita-income of the producing country increases. On the other hand, such a transformation of consumption pattern could be recognized as a result of the targeted business strategy of transnational firms: they start exploit the market of the less developed countries after the saturation of the market of developed countries. In this paper, we carefully examine the reason of the transformation of production and consumption pattern of canned tuna products referring to the Agribusiness development...|$|E
50|$|Although Australia {{is known}} for its black, and more {{recently}} blue, marlin fishery, striped marlin are often found in the subtropical waters of the vast island continent and are a popular target for Australian anglers. The country's largest interclub tournament is held at the Port Stephens area of New South Wales, and has produced several striped marlin records on ultralight and fly tackle. Larger striped marlin in the 250 to 300 lb-plus class often show up {{in the southern part of}} their range. Batemans Bay, Ulladulla and Bermagui are where fish of this class can be encountered. Live baiting, with such baits as slimy mackerel <b>and</b> <b>skipjack</b> <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> trolling artificial lures are the two most common techniques here, but many top crews have experienced success with fly-rod and light-tackle records using the bait-and-switch technique.|$|R

Total number of commercial longline vessels (larger than 10 GRT) was 533 in 2007 which is 47 vessels (8 %) less than that in 2006. Total number of pole-and-line vessels (larger than 20 GRT) was 116 in 2007 which is 7 vessels (6 %) less than that in 2006. The total WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin <b>and</b> <b>skipjack)</b> by the Japanese fishery in 2007 was 482, 840 mt that corresponds to 105 % of 459, 679 mt in 2006. In 2007, the catch of tunas by the purse seine fishery was 270, 997 mt (56 % of the total catch of tunas), with 128, 632 mt (27 %) by the pole-and-line, 69, 943 mt (15 %) by the longline, and the remaining 3 %was made by the other gears. With respect to the research activities for <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> billfishes, tagging studies for tropical <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> sharks, bluefin <b>tuna</b> larval sampling, longline fishing and collection of gonad samples for albacore were conducted. Currently, a research cruise to investigate behavioral characteristics of juvenile bigeye is being conducted in the western Pacific with the participation of a research boat of Fisheries Agency, FRA <b>tuna</b> purse seiner <b>and</b> commercial purse seiner. Starting in September, two research cruises are also scheduled to investigate swordfish and bigeye habitat {{in relation to the}} oceanographic features in the North Pacific...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to determine {{and analyze the}} factors affecting the value chain of tuna commodity in the Philippines. It also identifies the {{key players in the}} industry, and their roles and contributions in the value chain. The paper will utilize both primary and secondary data in the analysis. Secondary sources of data are mainly from the government institutions and private companies. Primary data consists of information obtained from personal interviews and observations covering the period 1999 <b>and</b> 2007. Four <b>tuna</b> canneries, out of six canneries, operating in the Philippines including other companies engaged in <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> tuna-related businesses were interviewed. The products involved in the study comprised of fresh, frozen <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> processed <b>tuna</b> products aimed at the export and domestic markets. Most of these products used primarily Yellowfin <b>and</b> <b>Skipjack,</b> which were caught in the Philippines and in the neighboring Southwest Pacific waters. An integrated framework that describes the commodity flow, process, and requirements in every phase of the value chain will be presented. Recent developments and future directions shall also be discussed given the economic, institutional, and environmental concerns faced by the tuna stakeholders. Cost efficiency, steady supply and global competitiveness are the major issues, among others, {{that need to be addressed}} to ensure the sustainability of the industry...|$|R

40|$|Examining {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> black marlin {{obtained in the}} south equatorial Pacific Ocean during three months from August to Octover 1957, the following results were obtained; 1) Food organisms obtained in the stomach were enumerated about 40. (c. f. Table 4) It seems that compositions of food resemble in equatorial regions. 2) I found the difference between yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> bigeye <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> also between the all species of <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> black marlin in respects of certain kinds of preys. I fonnd some species of the deep sea Pisces, such as Sternoptychidae, Myctophidae and Bramidae and, these Pisces were more abundant in the stomach of bigeye tuna than that of yellowfin tuna. These Pisces were not seen in Black Marlin. On the contrary, Megalopa and Alima, the planktonic larvae of the Decapoda and Stomatopoda in Crustacea, were found more abundant in the stomach of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> black marlin than that of bigeye tuna. I have rarely seen the reversed stomach in some individual of the bigeye tuna. As the result, it is presumed that bigeye tuna mostly swims in slightly deeper layer than yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> black marlin, {{and at the same}} time, black marlin mostly swims in shallower layer than tuna group. 3) Food organisms were composed of more than 10 % by the following preys, such as, Plagyodontidae, Sphyranenidae, Triacanthidae, Acinaceidae <b>and</b> Juvenile <b>Skipjack,</b> Decapoda in Crustacea and Decapoda in Cephalopoda. These preys are seemed {{to be the most important}} as food of <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> black marlin in the equatorial regions. 4) In the south equatorial Pacific Ocean, the stomachs were hardly seen empty, therefore, this area will be rich in food organisms. I presumed that the fishing ground for yellowfin tuna, the south equatorial Pacific Ocean is a considerably important situation for the Japanese tuna long-line. The species of the compositions of food in yellowfin tuna were richer than that of other species of tuna. (1) 東ソロモン海区で操業した 11 旭丸の資料から,食餌組成に就て検討して見た結果,現在迄マグロ類の餌の選択範囲は夫々非常に広く,その組成の傾向も相似であると云われてきた従来の見解と略々一致する. (2) 数種のpreyに就て,キハダ対メバチ,マグロ類対クロカヂキの食性に顕著な相異が見られた. これは全く渡辺(1958) の見解と一致する. 即,ムネエソ,ハダカイワシ,シマガツオの深海魚はキハダよりメバチの胃中に多く見られた. ムネエソ,ハダカイワシはクロカヂキの胃中に出現しなかつた. 且,クロカヂキの胃中に見られたシマガツオの出現率はメバチより低かつた. 次に表層性のトビウオがメバチの胃中に出現せず,且キハダに比してクロカヂキの胃中に多く出現した. 次に甲殻類中MegalopaやAlimaの如き浮遊性preyの出現率がメバチに比して,キハダ,クロカヂキに高い. 又,釣獲されたマグロ類中,胃が反転してpreyを吐出した状態で揚つてくる現象はメバチにのみ見られた. 以上の事から,メバチはキハダより深い層を遊泳している. 又,クロカヂキはマグロ類より棲息分布は浅い層にあると云う事が推察される. (3) 鮪類,梶木類に執つて出現率 10 %以上のpreyは餌料として最も重要であることは論を俟たないが,西部印度洋海域と南太平洋赤道海域に於て,共通に然も高い出現率を示したミズウオ,カマス,ギマ,クロタチカマス,カツオ若年魚の 6 種と甲殻類の,Decapoda,頭足類のDecapodaの餌生物は,マグロ,カヂキ類のpreyとして最も重要な位置を占めるものと思われる. (4) 南太平洋赤道海域と西部印度洋海域に共通して見られたことは,各魚種共空胃が極めて少い. 次にキハダは他の魚類に比して食餌組成の中が広いと云う事である. 以上の事から前者の理由に依り,両海区共preyが豊富で好漁場だと考えられ,後者の理由に依つて赤道海域はキハダの好漁場であることが推察される...|$|R
40|$|Morphometric {{data for}} {{tropical}} tunas caught with purse seine {{have been collected}} in the Indian Ocean over the last decades through routine sampling at processing factories and research projects.
