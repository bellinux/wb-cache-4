5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> as the Japanese one.|$|E

500|$|Reception to the miniseries varied. Reviewer Kevin Powers for Comics Bulletin and Richard George of IGN {{praised the}} action {{sequences}} and Maleev's visuals. The balance between action and story was also positively noted; Powers {{said that the}} first two sequences of the opening issue [...] "masterfully capture {{the spirit of the}} game". On the other hand, IGN's Jesse Schedeen, reviewing the second issue, stated the series' appeal was mostly superficial: [...] "try as they might to replicate [...] visceral moments, Bendis and Maleev just can't replicate <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> on the printed page." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's arena {{combat and}} racing levels were praised by Andrew Reiner of Game Informer, and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy {{similarly}} said that [...] "it's surprising how fun {{it can be}} to play interstellar gladiator." [...] GamePro praised the game's pacing, saying that the first game felt like it didn't [...] "really show its true colors until about halfway through", but that Going Commando had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> {{by the end of the}} second level. GameSpot mentioned that the [...] "great sense of humor" [...] of the original game is also noticeable in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, a statement echoed by GameZone when they said that the game's cut-scenes [...] "represent some of the most thought-out and gut-wrenchingly funny sequences ever witnessed in a platforming game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> you get when you look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E
500|$|Running {{throughout}} McNeile's {{books is}} {{the metaphor of}} warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., he writes, [...] "To bag {{a man with a}} gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> at all, even if they are Germans". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: The Third Round, The Final Count, Knock-Out and Challenge.|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told me {{that this}} story about a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. I had <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E

Seven months {{after the release of}} the standard edition, an expanded double-disc deluxe edition of the album was released in the United States on April 3,2007. In addition to the original track listing, the deluxe edition features five new songs, including [...] "Beautiful Liar", a duet with Colombian singer Shakira. The single made Billboard Hot 100 history when it moved ninety-one positions—from number ninety-four to number three—on April 7,2007. [...] "Amor Gitano" [...] ("Gypsy Love"), a Spanish-language flamenco-pop duet with Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández served as a soundtrack for Telemundo's [...] "El Zorro" [...] telenovela, was included in the deluxe edition, alongside Spanish re-recordings of [...] "Listen" [...] ("Oye"), [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] ("Irreemplazable") and [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] ("Bello Embustero"). The idea of recording songs in a foreign language emanated from her experience when Destiny's Child collaborated with Alejandro Sanz for [...] "Quisiera Ser" [...] (2000). Beyoncé worked with producer Rudy Perez for these recordings in order to retain <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> of the English version of the song into the Spanish translation.

500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody knew me, when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E

When I started playing music I got <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>feeling</b> from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together.

2500|$|Captain Jack, {{like most}} army officers, looked upon {{reservations}} as temporary reserves where Indians {{would begin to}} learn about the American way of life. [...] He believed that Indians were capable of great change and that private land ownership would lead to their ultimate assimilation into American society. [...] Captain Jack also believed Native Americans would observe modern life and different cultures, acquire new skills and customs, and change at their own pace and terms. Crawford was angry with the Indians about Custer and the Little Big Horn, and his early performances and poems portray the Indian as a dangerous but worthy opponent. [...] His later performances and poems are more sympathetic, and focus on shared universal emotions with whites. [...] Crawford held progressive views of Indians, including the sanctioning of interracial marriages, which he depicted in poetry and short stories. Captain Jack promoted Indian education and opposed off-reservation boarding schools.
