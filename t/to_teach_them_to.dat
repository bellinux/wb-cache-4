Sectional points are awarded for the stockman’s challenge for care and skill in catching the Brumby and their ability <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> lead. These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety, Tamworth and Murrurundi plus The Man From Snowy River Challenge in Corryong, Victoria. Several New South Wales show societies, including Walcha, Bellingen and Dorrigo, hold special classes for registered Brumbies at their annual agricultural shows.|$|E

She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture {{in order to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic plasticity. One study sought to teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted {{to determine if the}} same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for synaptic plasticity also applied to nonsynaptic plasticity affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity share common learning rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity synergistically form a coherent engram to store memory traces.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E
500|$|Controversy also {{arose from}} the YOG {{attendance}} policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, a local primary school. The school stated that a S$5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non-school day. The principal, Clifford Chua, {{said that it was}} to [...] "ensure that our children learn the value of responsibility and not take this rare opportunity for granted, by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance". Also, the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event. However, the move garnered mixed reactions from parents, who either supported the idea or felt it was not the right way to do things. Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School, Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) encouraged co-pay of $1 to $2 by the students <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> treasure their tickets.|$|E

500|$|Songbirds {{and their}} {{associated}} symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird {{is a key}} motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can [...] "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that [...] "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, [...] "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." [...] Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, [...] "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson." [...] Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when {{trying to make a}} moral point.|$|E

2500|$|Historically (prior to the 20th century) the {{relationship}} between a master craftsman and his apprentice was paternalistic. Apprentices were often very young when entrusted to a master craftsman by their parents. It was seen as the master's responsibility not only to teach the craft, but also to instill the virtues of a good craftsman. He was supposed to teach honour, loyalty, fair-mindedness, courtesy and compassion for the poor. He was also supposed to offer spiritual guidance, to ensure his apprentices fulfilled their religious duties and <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> [...] "honour the Lord" [...] (Jesus Christ) with their lives. The master craftsman who failed to do this would lose his reputation and would accordingly be dishonoured - a very bad fate in those days. The apprenticeship ended with the so-called Freisprechung (exculpation). The master announced in front of the trade heading that the apprentice had been virtuous and God-loving. The young person now had the right to call himself a [...] "Geselle" [...] (journeyman). He had two options: either to work for a master or to become a master himself. Working for another master had several disadvantages. One was that, in many cases, the journeyman who was not a master was not allowed to marry and found a family. Because the church disapproved of sex outside of marriage, he was obliged to become a master if {{he did not want to}} spend his life celibate. Accordingly, many of the so-called [...] "Geselle" [...] decided to go on a journey in order to become a master. This was called [...] "Waltz" [...] or Journeyman years.|$|E

2500|$|In 1675, the Iroquois {{made peace}} with the Machian while finally {{defeating}} the Susquenhannock. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, the Five Nations started to raid {{what is now the}} Midwest, battling the Miami and the Illinois while alternatively fighting against and attempting to make an alliance with the Ottawa. One Onondaga chief, Otreouti, whom the French called La Grande Gueule ("the big mouth"), announced in a speech in 1684 that the wars against the Illinois and Miami were justified because [...] "They came to hunt beavers on our lands...". Initially, the French took an ambivalent attitude towards the Iroquois push west. On one hand, having the Five Nations at war with other nations prevented those nations from trading with the English at Albany while on the other hand, the French did not want to the Iroquois become the only middlemen in the fur trade. But as the Iroquois continued to win against the other nations, prevented French and Algonquin fur traders from entering the Mississippi river valley, and the Ottawa showed signs of finally making an alliance with the Five Nations, in 1684 the French declared war on the Iroquois. Otreouti in an appeal for help correctly noted: [...] "The French will have all the beavers and are angry with us for bringing you any". Starting in 1684, the French repeatedly raided Kanienkeh, burning crops and villages as Louis gave orders to [...] "humble" [...] the Five Nations once and for all, and <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> respect the [...] "grandeur" [...] of France. The repeated French raids took their toll with the Mohawk who could field about 300 warriors in the 1670s to able to field only 170 warriors in the summer of 1691. The Iroquois struck back by making raids into New France with the most successful being a raid on Lachine in 1689 that killed 24 Frenchmen while taking 80 captives, but the superior resources of the French state proceeded to grind them down until they finally made peace in 1701.|$|E
