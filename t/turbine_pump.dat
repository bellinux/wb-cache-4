50|$|Boardman’s {{drainage}} windmill {{was built}} in 1897 by a local millwright Daniel England of Ludham. Trestle mills or Skeleton mills as they are sometimes described, were a later and less expensive alternative to a brick built windmill. As {{a result of their}} mainly timber construction very few have survived the ravages of the weather and of time. Boardman’s mill is one of only three Trestle mills left on the Broads. The others being at Horning (OS Map Ref: TG344175) and at St Olaves (OS Map Ref: TM459995). The mill was originally fitted with a scoopwheel but this was later replaced with a <b>turbine</b> <b>pump.</b> Boardman’s mill stopped pumping in 1938 when it was blown over in a Gale.|$|E
50|$|There {{are nine}} {{drainage}} mills situated {{along the banks}} of the river. Brograve Mill on the Waxham New Cut is an early nineteenth century, three-storey brick mill, which is derelict but retained parts of its sails and most of its internal machinery in 2003. West Somerton Mill was built in 1900 by Dan England, from the millwrights England's of Ludham, and is in better condition. Although it has no sails, its internal <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> and some of the other machinery are still extant. Horsey Mill is a four-storey structure which pumped water into Horsey Mere, and is owned by the National Trust. It was built in the mid-nineteenth century, and was modified in 1897 and again in 1912, when the work was carried out by Dan England. It originally powered a scoop wheel to raise the water into the mere, but this was replaced by a pumping engine in an outbuilding at the foot of the tower. It ceased to operate in 1943 after being struck by lightning, and was acquired by the National Trust five years later. It was restored in 1961, the work being carried out by the Norfolk Windmills Trust. Its fantail was destroyed during a gale in 1987, and during further restoration, which was completed in 2004, new sails were fitted, but with no shutters or the spider mechanism which operates them. Heigham Holmes Mill is a mid-nineteenth century four-storey brick tower which retains most of its machinery. It is grade II* listed. Like West Somerton, Martham Mill was also built by Dan England, but consists of four storeys and was completed in 1908. It drove a <b>turbine</b> <b>pump,</b> and has now been converted into a residence, as has High's Mill, another four-storey brick tower mill built in the mid-nineteenth century. The next mill downstream is the derelict Repp's Drainage Mill below Potter Heigham.|$|E

It has a maximum discharge capacity of [...] To the right of the spillway is the power house which contains one 150 MW Francis turbine generator and three 90 MW reversible Francis <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> generators.

It creates the lower reservoir with a storage capacity of [...] of which [...] can be used for pumped storage power generation. When the pumped storage capability is used, the Panjiakou Reservoir serves as the upper reservoir and water is released down to the three pump generators for power production. It is subsequently discharged into the lower reservoir. This occurs during periods of high peak power demand. When power demand is low, usually at night when electricity is cheaper, the turbines of the pump generators reverse and pump water back into the upper reservoir. This process repeats as needed. A small power plant on the lower reservoir dam contains two 5 MW Kaplan turbine bulb-generators.|$|E

5000|$|As late as 1923 Governments, British and foreign, {{continued}} to hold large war-surplus fleets of motor transport vehicles still dampening demand for Dennis commercial vehicles and demand for White & Poppe engines. The parent company developed a new multi stage <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> and turned to motor lawnmowers as well. By the end of 1923 the possibility of manufacture of London omnibuses had arisen. Poppe designed a new car but it was decided against putting it into production. He remained a director of Dennis Brothers until he resigned in 1923 though he continued the link {{as a consultant to}} Dennis Brothers. The Rover Company, their Clegg being obsolete, bought Peter Poppe and his completed car design making him their chief engineer and putting his car design into production as their Rover 14/45.Alfred White remained in charge of the White and Poppe Coventry operation. By the end of 1924 the stock of war surplus commercial vehicles ceased to be a factor and the group's export sales were at an all-time record. The following year group profits trebled and the Guildford extensions paused in 1920 were resumed but the chairman made no other comment than confirming the wisdom of Dennis Brothers' purchase of White and Poppe. The extraordinary prosperity of Dennis Brothers' core business was demonstrated the next year when instead of issuing yet more bonus shares to shareholders they repaid £250,000 capital to their shareholders because the company held too much cash (£467,000 at balance date) for its own requirements. The White and Poppe operation was self-financing and managed {{to keep pace with the}} expansion at Guildford. A new engine was brought to market during 1926 and proved [...] "an unqualified success [...] [...] [...] with large numbers of satisfied users". During the 1920s the rapid increase in turnover and profits was not due to increased prices but to higher sales volume. However White and Poppe's large factory was not yet at full capacity. Their principal product remained internal combustion engines.|$|E
