5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service.

5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for <b>the</b> <b>offering</b> of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through <b>the</b> <b>offering</b> of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E

5|$|William Wailes {{produced}} a {{design for the}} seven-light east window following a competition launched in 1846; however, delays in raising the money caused delays in its installation.

The tree design {{in the window of}} the south transept was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854. In the north transept is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853, designed and installed by the St Helens Crown Glass Company which later became Pilkington. Another Wailes design depicting <b>the</b> <b>Offering</b> of the Wise Men was installed in the Lady Chapel, alongside one designed by Arthur O'Connor.

5|$|A Late Preclassic tomb {{has been}} excavated, {{believed}} to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial1; it was found during excavations of Structure7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure7A. These ceramics date <b>the</b> <b>offering</b> {{to the end of the}} Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD100–200.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 52 urns were {{excavated}} from {{the ruins of}} Jilotepeque Viejo; 8 of these were destroyed by the 1976 earthquake leaving 44 available for study. Twelve of these were {{in the collection of}} the Musée de l'Homme in Paris for approximately thirty years; These urns, together with all other artefacts from Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo), were repatriated to Guatemala in 1998. Each urn contained the cremated remains of a single adult. All of these appeared to be mature or elderly adults; the remains of young adults were notably absent, indicating that elite warriors were buried in some other manner. The urns themselves represented a variety of highland ceramic types. Analysis of bone fragments in the cremated remains indicates that the entire body was burnt without any special treatment for the skull, although <b>the</b> <b>offering</b> of a skull was excavated from Pyramid C1. Surviving skull fragments indicated the practice of artificial skull deformation among the elite inhabitants of the city. The remains of animal bones were found mixed among a significant portion of the contents of the urns; where identifiable these included deer bones and those of a number of bird species, particularly parrots and birds of prey.|$|E

The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find {{the pieces of the}} Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus.

Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories restored and Medeus gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.|$|E
5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as <b>the</b> <b>offering</b> of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E
