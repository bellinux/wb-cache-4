25|$|The local {{authorities}} are endeavouring {{to prevent the}} effects of erosion. Hard defences {{in the form of}} a concrete seawall and <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> have given some protection. It has been suggested that a large underwater reef made of tyres could be built off the Holderness coast to mitigate this erosion but it would be costly to build.|$|R
40|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>groynes</b> {{have been}} used for centuries to retain and control beaches. They are found {{throughout}} Europe but little information is available about the design or detailing of the structures. During recent years alternatives such as beach renourishment, detached breakwaters and rock groynes {{have been used}} increasingly, however <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> can still offer advantages in terms of sustainability, cost and appearance. These include the relative ease with which the level and profile of the groyne may be adapted (by adding or removing planks) or maintained. Their appearance and small footprint are particularly advantageous on amenity beaches. Beaches constantly change as they respond to natural processes including waves, currents and the wind. These processes can result in material being transported from the beach, which if not replaced by material from adjacent areas, will result in erosion. Groynes are constructed more or less perpendicular to the shoreline to restrict the movement of sediment along the shore. They usually work in two ways, by providing a physical barrier to the movement of the beach material, which enables the beach to re-orientate approximately perpendicular to the incident wave direction, and by diverting longshore currents (which may be caused by tides or waves) away from the beach. In the past, groyne design was often limited to the slightly improved replacement of existing structures. As most local authorities in the United Kingdom are responsible for their own coastal protection, groyne design differs largely along the coastline. The performance and durability of <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> is highly dependent on the design and detailing of the structure. By comparing several schemes, various advantages and disadvantages of groyne design have been identified. Keeping a structure and its connections as simple as possible will benefit the ease of construction and maintenance. Design details such as attaching softwood or recycled timber rubbing pieces to the piles at critical levels, thus protecting them from abrasion, can considerably increase the lifetime of a groyne. In order to assure the sustainable use of timber, certified timber should be specified. Additionally, reuse and recycling of timber can substantially reduce the need for new timber, and should be incorporated in the design and maintenance of structures. If designed properly, <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> can be an effective and sustainable solution to retain a beach where the main erosion problem is caused by longshore sediment transport.

50|$|Barton on Sea has had {{for many}} years a problem with coastal erosion. In the past, the cliffs have eroded away {{at a rate of}} up to 1 metre a year, and several {{buildings}} have been lost. In the early 1900s the grassy promenade {{at the top of the}} cliffs was 100 metres wide, today it is around 20 metres at its furthest points. The erosion was encouraged by the sea-defences added to the west at Bournemouth, thus starving Barton of the sediment needed for protecting its cliffs. Some coastal protection measures at Barton were installed in the late 1930s but fell into disrepair during World War II. In 1964 a series of <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> and a cliff drainage system was installed along 300m of the sea-front. This was followed in 1965-8 by a timber revetment backed by large rocks; an extension to the drainage system; and some rock groynes. Later improvements have consisted of replacing the <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> with rock groynes; and replacing the timber revetment with a rock structure of dark grey limestone boulders to protect the toe of the cliff. Today's cliff slip problems are largely due to inland water seepage. There have been recent experiments with vegetation defences (planting shrubs, plants and trees on the cliff face) to prevent rotational cliff slump, and therefore slowing the retreat of the cliff towards land which is in use.|$|R
5000|$|Through {{the years}} Swanage has {{suffered}} from flooding, with severe flooding occurring as recently as 1990. In 1993 a large-scale flood alleviation scheme was completed, ending in the banjo-shaped 'new jetty' outletting rainwater. This in itself created a new problem, disturbing the natural northward drift of sand up the bay, with a buildup on the southern side and reduction of sand on the northern. This reduction of sand levels exposed the foundations of parts of the seawall threatening to damage it. As a result, the beach was improved in 2005-06 by construction of new greenheart <b>timber</b> <b>groynes</b> and the placement of [...] of sand as beach nourishment.|$|R
2500|$|Coastal erosion at Hampton-on-Sea {{has been}} {{estimated}} at [...] per annum between {{the construction of the}} old Hampton Pier in 1865 to 1959 when the Council built the sea wall. The direction and rate of influential currents is unknown, but it is calculated that [...] of coastal sediment per annum is scoured by the sea from the Hampton-on-Sea coast and deposited [...] to the west at Long Rock, Swalecliffe. This area with a defensive frontage of [...] is now known as the Hampton Flood Basin and Hampton Brook, now officially Westbrook, is still prone to floodlocking, as occurred in 2001. Although the 1959 sea wall and groynes were updated in 1983, and Hampton Pier Avenue's rock armour revetment was upgraded in 1994, it is thought that eventually the sea defences would need to be raised. Nevertheless, although sea-damage was done by the great 1953 and 1978 storms, the upgraded defences protected this coast from the severe 1996 storm. Costs of increasing flood defences here are estimated at £1–7million, especially as the work has to be modified because this area is a SSSI and SPA. Cost and limitations meant that a short-term solution of £635,000 capital works was recommended by the Council Steering Group on 29 June 2009 to be implemented from winter 2011 to spring 2011. The recommendation was to hold the line with replacement and improvement of six <b>timber</b> <b>groynes,</b> importing a new beach of [...] partly taken from Long Rock, raising and extending the rear wall and closing off openings with floodgates. [...] Beach replenishment and groyne replanking would continue at intervals.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 {{the station}} was {{allocated}} a new Mersey-class lifeboat. She was called Doris M. Mann of Ampthill and she became operational on 3 July of that year. To accommodate this new lifeboat the station once again had to be considerably enlarged and altered. The house had to be almost completely re-built whilst still retaining the historic integrity of the 1895 station. In the mid 1990s work was also carried out to the outside environment of the station. Work was carried out on the <b>timber</b> revetments and <b>groynes</b> to prevent further coastal erosion of the sandy headland on which the boat house is located. This was achieved by re-using the Greenheart timbers re-claimed after the demolishion of the Eastbourne slipway. Extra new groynes were also installed to retain the beach {{in front of the}} station, vital for the continued beach launching of the lifeboats.|$|R
40|$|Current {{government}} {{guidelines for}} the appraisal of coastal defence projects in the UK do not require that non-market amenity benefits to be considered. However, a new option in coastal defence, namely multi-purpose reefs, provides an opportunity to integrate coastal defence with significant amenity provision. This paper reports {{the findings of a}} choice experiment study that evaluated the amenity benefits of four alternative coastal defence systems currently being considered for Borth in west Wales. The results indicate that traditional coastal defence options such as <b>timber</b> and rock <b>groynes</b> do not generate amenity benefits, while a multipurpose reef would generate significant benefits in terms of improvements in the visual appeal of the beach, safer swimming opportunities and improved surfing conditions. Importantly, these benefits were found to be significant for all members of the local community and not just surf ers. Based on our findings, we recommend that {{guidelines for the}} appraisal of coastal defence projects should be amended to incorporate non-market amenity benefits.

5000|$|The {{northern}} frontage of Sheringham {{is protected}} by a concrete seawall which also serves as the promenade. It is {{a vital part of}} the protection of the town against the natural erosion that occurs along the North Norfolk coast. The storm surge of 1953 considerably damaged Sheringham's wooden sea defences. In front of the sea wall are groynes, armoured at their bases with large blocks of natural rock, which prevent long shore drift. There are numerous drains along the frontage. To the east towards West Runton the seawall ends just below Beeston Bump. From there a <b>timber</b> revetment and <b>groyne</b> system, designed and constructed in 1976, runs eastwards for 2 km (just over a mile) to West Runton Gap. The shoreline management plans of the Department for Environment include a policy of [...] "managed retreat" [...] along this stretch of coast. The revetment between Sheringham and West Runton is no longer being maintained and is thus in a poor state of repair. Sections that become hazardous will be removed. The coastline will then be left to evolve naturally.|$|R
