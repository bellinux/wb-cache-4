5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|Fort Tigné {{was one of}} the few fortifications that {{actively}} tried <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> invasion. On 10 June, the French {{attempted to}} capture it in a minor skirmish, but were successfully repelled. The fort also fired its guns in support of a counterattack by the Order's navy against the French, and it prevented French ships from entering Marsamxett.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} al-Qaeda {{can be traced}} to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden {{traveled}} to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Soviets. Under the guidance of Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden became more radical. In 1996, bin Laden issued his first fatwā, calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction to restructure {{the interior of the}} building. Etty was prominent in the effort <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> redesign and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward {{in order to receive}} a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, Luther {{had argued}} against <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> Turks, whom he {{presented}} as a scourge intentionally sent by God to sinning Christians, and that resisting {{it would have been}} equivalent <b>to</b> <b>resisting</b> <b>the</b> will of God. This position had been initially shared by Erasmus as well, but was strongly criticized by authors such as Thomas More: ...|$|R
5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, mainly {{because he did not}} want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
5|$|In Romanian historiography, the {{consensus}} describes Menumorut {{as one of}} the three Romanian rulers who attempted <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Magyar conquest of the intra-Carpathian regions of present-day Romania. According to the Gesta, the Magyars eventually besieged and seized Menumorut's fortress at Biharia, and forced him to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán, the son of Árpád, the Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The chronicle states that Menumorut died around 906 and was succeeded by his son-in-law.|$|E

5|$|Kartik {{then made}} {{sporadic}} {{appearances in the}} VB triangular ODI series, playing in four of India's ten matches, as he and Kumble were brought {{in and out of}} the team in an attempt to challenge the Australian superiority. He continued to be punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/178 from 26 overs, an economy rate of 6.84. However, he did manage <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|The Mewat {{region where}} TJ started around Delhi was {{inhabited}} by the Meos, a Rajput ethnic group, {{some of whom}} had allegedly converted to Islam, and then re-converted to Hinduism when Muslim political power declined in the region, lacking the necessary acumen (according to one author, Ballard) required <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> cultural and religious influence of Hindus, prior to the arrival of Tablighi Jamaat.|$|E
25|$|Around 25,000 {{troops were}} {{deployed}} {{to quell the}} rebellion.

However, remnants of the rebel forces continued <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> and <b>the</b> number of troops in the region was doubled.

5|$|The {{battle at}} Catraeth {{has been seen}} as an attempt <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> advance of the Angles, who had {{probably}} by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north-eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia. At some time after the battle, the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom, possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638, and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers {{have concluded that}} it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. <b>To</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} {{transmitted from}} British and French fishermen to natives {{on the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection). The plague killed between 90% and 95% of the local Wampanoag inhabitants. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site left their cornfields and cleared areas vacant for the Pilgrims to occupy; it also meant that the Native Americans were in no condition <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the colonists.|$|E

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado was {{attracted}} by reports of gold, and also wished {{to prevent the}} complete abandonment of the territory by the Spanish. He invaded Higueras in 1536, with 80 well-armed soldiers of mixed infantry and cavalry, accompanied by about 3000 indigenous Guatemalan auxiliaries; Many of the auxiliaries were Achi Maya warriors with a particularly fearsome reputation. He also brought Indian and African slaves to work the mines, as well as livestock to assist the colonisation effort. His route took him past a strong native fortress called the Peñol of Cerquín, where native warriors had amassed <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> Spanish. Alvarado, seeing {{the strength of the}} fortress and aware of the pressing need to relieve Buena Esperanza, decided not to storm the fortress and pushed onwards to assist his countrymen.|$|E
5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked <b>to</b> <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
