500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E

These words were chosen as they vaguely suggest some sort of existential crisis and for the lack of any published literature referencing them as psychotic symptoms. No other psychiatric symptoms were claimed. If admitted, the pseudopatients were instructed to [...] "act normally," [...] reporting that they felt fine and no longer heard voices. Hospital records obtained after the experiment indicate that all pseudopatients were characterized as friendly and cooperative by staff.|$|E

6000|$|When Romola paused, with cheeks glowing, {{and with}} quivering lips, there was dead silence. As she saw Fra Girolamo {{standing}} motionless before her, {{she seemed to}} herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> her own words over again; words that in this echo of consciousness were in strange, painful dissonance with the memories that made part of his presence to her. The moments of silence were expanded by gathering compunction and self-doubt. She had committed sacrilege in her passion. And even the sense that she could retract nothing of her plea, that her mind could not submit itself to Savonarola's negative, made it the more needful to her to satisfy those reverential memories.

60|$|Over the downs {{great numbers}} of larks were singing. It was warm April {{that year and}} early. All the cloud stuff in the sky was {{gathered}} into great towering slow-sailing masses, and the rest was blue of the intensest. The air was so clean that Benham felt it clean in the substance of his body. The chestnuts {{down the hill to}} the right were flowering, the beeches were luminously green, and the oaks in the valley foaming gold. And sometimes it was one lark filled his ears, and sometimes he seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> all the larks for miles about him.

He had been at several schools before coming to ours, but had been deemed by each {{successive}} schoolmaster a hopeless imbecile. And he was so mischievous that they advised his poor mother to take him away and try if she could not instil a little knowledge into him herself. The old lady was a meek, simple body, and quite as stupid as her hopeful son appeared <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Hearing</b> that our master was a sharp fellow, and somewhat noted as a good manager of obstreperous boys, she brought him to our school as a last resource, and having introduced him to the master, went her way.|$|E

5000|$|W.L. Brown, as the {{organizer}} of the regiment, was made colonel and fixed the date of July 4, 1861, as the date for all the companies to leave home and rendezvous at Lafayette. Gilbreath describes that [...] "almost every man, woman, and child was at Valparaiso" [...] {{and that the only}} music <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hear</b> <b>was</b> fife and drum, which were being played by the Sheriff and Blacksmith, both of whom <b>were</b> [...] "only <b>to</b> anxious to march us to the railroad station and to go with us to Lafayette". Their train did not make any stops, but rather rode straight through to Lafayette, where the Regiment was fully assembled. The 20th Indiana Volunteer Regiment was mustered into service with the United States on the 22nd of July, 1861, with Gilbreath's company being assigned as [...] "I" [...] company.|$|R

Every {{work is not}} to be done at {{the same}} time; every time not being {{convenient}} for such a work; There is a time for all things, and every thing is beautiful in its time (Eccl 3:11). There is a time to pray, a time to hear, a time to read, a time to confer, a time to meditate, a time to do, and a time to suffer. Now, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> when we should be preaching and doing, that is, yielding active obedience to that under which we ought to suffer, is not good. Christ was very wary, that both his doings and sufferings were rightly timed (John 2:3,4; 13:1,2). And herein we ought to follow his steps. To be at plough in the field, when I should be hearing the word, is not good; and to be talking abroad, when I should be instructing my family at home, is as bad: 'Whoso keepeth the commandment, shall feel no evil thing: 'and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment' (Eccl 8:5). Good things mistimed, are fruitless, unprofitable, and vain.|$|E

50|$|The {{last person}} seen with Elizabeth Short before her disappearance, Manley was the LAPD's top {{suspect in the}} first few days after the killing. After two {{polygraph}} tests and a sworn alibi, Manley was set free. He also identified Short's handbag purse and one of her shoes after they were discovered in a trashcan on January 25, 1947, several miles from the murder scene. Manley, who had been discharged from the army for mental disability, subsequently suffered a series of nervous breakdowns and claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> voices. As a result, he was committed to Patton State Hospital by his wife in 1954. He died on January 16, 1986. The coroner attributed his death to an accidental fall.|$|E
5000|$|Idolator's Rachel Sonis {{labeled the}} song [...] "endlessly infectious". Chris DeVille of Stereogum called it [...] "a {{gorgeous}} thing to behold: thumping acoustic guitar figures, a crisply minimal disco drum beat, eerie background noise, thunderous bass, and twinkling pianos, all topped off by Grimes-reminiscent high-end vocal work. You're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> {{this one for}} a long time." [...] Pastes Scott Russell dubbed it [...] "hauntingly beautiful". Alex Siber of Pigeons and Planes said [...] "what sounds like a soft-spoken soul begins to soar, liberated, as the record progresses. Rogers breathes the crisp air of glacial plains, fueling a voice that's at once as delicate and powerful as the nature she describes and samples in the track's backbone. Each component of 'Alaska' pulses with the same heartbeat, amplifying itself like an echo chamber in which dancing is required and sadness is left at the door. What remains is an ear worm as infectious as it is earnest, one that took time to crystalize." ...|$|E

The village {{followed}} their leader, “Tuvid,” and found the Spaniards warm and interesting and agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> baptized in 1773. “Tuvid” was given the first name Eugenio, so thus his name was Eugenio Agudo. Eugenio had one son. The Spanish chose to give his son the name Jose after St. Joseph, the patron saint of Ivana, because the Spanish were so pleased with Eugenio’s assistance and compliance. This is how the Agudo name was born (the story of Tuvid provided by former Batanes Gov. Silvino B. Agudo).|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Rob Hubbard of the St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote: It's a very {{engaging}} piece with a programmatic pulse, beginning with an opening theme that stutters, stops and restarts a few times, {{just like a}} faltering machine making its maiden voyage (a Silicon Valley startup of a different sort). But get going it does, the strings sometimes voicing the kind of melancholy layers found in Samuel Barber's harmonies. The work eventually becomes a driving foxtrot reminiscent of John Adams (another Bay Area product). Hubbard added, [...] "The work demonstrated Bates to be a composer with a vivid imagination. You're likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hearing</b> a lot from him in coming years." [...] Elaine Schmidt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called the piece [...] "effervescent" [...] and lauded, [...] "the piece began with short bursts of melodic and harmonic activity that eventually coalesced in an engaging work that's somehow full of positive energy." ...|$|E
