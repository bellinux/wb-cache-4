In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure.

If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

25|$|Like many Carlists Caylà {{welcomed the}} fall of Alfonsist monarchy, unlike most of them he did not {{demonstrate}} hostility to the Republic and – clearly against most Carlists – he hoped that it would produce a genuine democracy. In his Joventut editorials Caylà remained cautious and preferred not to jump to conclusions as to the new regime.

He called his fellow Carlists not to renounce their vision, suggesting to see whether the Republic would <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> orderly state or whether the project would fail. In his trademark style he warned that extremism was the key enemy of the new regime.|$|E

However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the rest of the afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E
