5|$|Martin's death largely took <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of {{the federal}} perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, {{on the day before}} jury {{selection}} in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Professor Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> to produce a vacuum, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

25|$|Crossflow is {{a design}} {{in which the}} air flow is {{directed}} perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material. Water flows (perpendicular to the air) through the fill by gravity. The air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume. Lastly, a fan forces <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the vacuum pump {{paved the way for}} the experiments of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke into the nature of vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Robert Hooke in 1658.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, in Elitloppet {{at their}} home track Solvalla, Johansson and Victory Tilly faced foreign stars like Italian Varenne and French Général du Pommeau, the reigning Prix d'Amérique champion. Victory Tilly and Johansson won their {{elimination}} despite starting from post seven. In the subsequent final, {{just as in the}} elimination, Victory Tilly went to the front out of the gate. Général du Pommeau was placed outside in first over. Meanwhile, favourite Varenne galloped shortly. The two horses in the front kept the pace up all through the race, and none of the other contenders posed a threat. Victory Tilly defeated his French opponent, and driver/trainer Johansson threw his whip into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of joy as the finish line was crossed and many of the 32,000 attending celebrated. Victory Tilly's 1:53.2 (1:10.5km rate) mark was a new all-age world record for geldings trotting on a five-eighths of a mile track. After the race, Johansson said that this possibly was the best race ever by a Swedish trotter and that Victory Tilly was the best trotter he had ever trained or driven.|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for endothermy {{is provided by}} the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to Carrier's constraint, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their undulated locomotion forces <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of the lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a gulp of fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier's constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the lower position of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.|$|E

500|$|On Thanksgiving Day 1976, Morrison {{performed}} at the farewell concert for the Band. It was his first live performance in several years, and he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, Harvey Goldsmith, said he [...] "literally kicked him out there." [...] Morrison was on good terms {{with the members of}} the Band as near-neighbours in Woodstock, and they had the shared experience of stage fright. At the concert, he performed two songs. His first was a rendition of the classic Irish song [...] "Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral". His second song was [...] "Caravan", from his 1970 album Moondance. Greil Marcus, in attendance at the concert, wrote: [...] "Van Morrison turned the show around...singing to the rafters and ...burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette.

2500|$|A 1908 {{paper by}} Geiger, On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter, {{describes}} the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two meters in length. [...] At {{one end of}} the tube was a quantity of [...] "radium emanation" [...] (R) that served as a source of alpha particles. [...] The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). [...] In the middle of the tube was a 0.9mm-wide slit. [...] The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. [...] A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. [...] Geiger pumped all <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>out</b> of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. [...] Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. [...] Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some gold foil over the slit at AA. [...] This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out. [...] This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. [...] The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection. [...] Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger angles—perhaps larger than 90°.|$|E
