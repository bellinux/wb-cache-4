50|$|Rabbit was a British location-specific (<b>Telepoint)</b> {{telephone}} service backed by Hutchison, which later created the Orange GSM mobile network, followed by 3. The Rabbit network was the best-known of four such services {{introduced in the}} 1980s, the others being Phonepoint, Mercury Callpoint and Zonephone. Although Hutchison had been issued a licence for Rabbit in 1989, the service was not launched until May 1992. <b>Telepoint</b> services such as Rabbit allowed subscribers to carry specially designed (CT2) home phone handsets with them and make outgoing calls whenever they were within 100 metres of a Rabbit transmitter.|$|E
50|$|CT2 is a {{cordless}} telephony standard {{that was used}} in the early 1990s to provide short-range proto-mobile phone service in some countries in Europe. It is considered the precursor to the more successful DECT system. CT2 was also referred to by its marketing name, <b>Telepoint.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Rabbit name, logo and {{advertising}} campaign idea was devised by Hook Advertising and specifically its chairman Chris Joseph. After pitching to and then signing with the Barclays Philips Shell consortium (BYPS) in 1989, when BYPS sold the <b>telepoint</b> network business to Hutchison in late 1990 Hook Advertising {{refused to sign}} over the copyright of the Rabbit logo. Hutchison had terminated the contracts of other BYPS suppliers and Hook Advertising believed both that {{they were about to}} have their own contract terminated too and that signing over the copyright was not part of their contract. Hutchison terminated the contract in September 1991 and sued Hook Advertising in the High Court for an assignment of the copyright. Hook Advertising replied by suing Barclays, Philips, Shell and Hutchinson for various breaches and severations of contract. Barclays in turn sued Hook Advertising. Litigation continued for four years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Computers {{are ever}} more thought of to support {{cooperative}} work over distances. Thus tele-cooperation tools and environments are needed which bring {{the meeting and}} joint-working onto everyoneâ€™s desktop. The following paper introduces a framework for such tele-cooperation. The required cooperation-awareness is achieved by a session model around which {{the building blocks of}} the entire service are configured. A session management service controls the underlying services application sharing and <b>telepointing...</b>|$|R
40|$|JVTOS (Joint Viewing and Tele-Operation Service) is an {{advanced}} teleservice to support cooperative work over distance which allows distributed users {{to work in}} a collaborative fashion with multimedia. JVTOS comprises facilities for session management, floor control, multimedia application sharing, <b>telepointing,</b> and audio/video communication. It provides generic support for cooperationaware multimedia applications.

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} success in strategic partnering between {{large and small}} organisations has received little research attention though it is becoming an increasingly common alternative to out-sourcing and sub-contracting in project management. This research sought to identify or confirm factors affecting the success of unequal partnerships in project management. It sought further to develop a practical model for strategic partnering in which identified factors were integrated to the mutual benefit of partners. Based on {{a case study of}} strategic partnering between a large organization, fictionally named <b>Telepoint,</b> and six of its smaller partners, this exploratory study engaged a focus group to identify key partnering success factors. The initial findings were confirmed from the literature and substantiated with semi-structured interviews involving senior and operations managers involved in these unequal partnerships in project management. A modified content analysis of <b>Telepoint</b> was used to validate purposive informant interview data and grounded theory approaches were then applied to group confirmed success factors towards a model for strategic partnering. Twenty success factors were identified and grouped to create a matrix of six inter-related success elements from which a model for strategic partnership was developed. Confirming that trust arose from clear communication of commitment to shared benefit through the development of appropriate systems and processes study, this study noted that the roles played by innovation and organisational cultures in unequal collaboration were integral to partnering success while recognising that the significance of small partner creativity and innovative capacity was frequently undervalued. From a practical viewpoint, the study highlighted organisational and strategic changes that would assist <b>Telepoint</b> to transform its perceived partnership domination from a supplier/sub-contractor relationship to strategic partnership and increase its potential to source and maintain integrated project management partnerships for mutual benefit with its smaller partners...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} software system KAMEDIN (Kooperatives Arbeiten und MEdizinische Diagnostik auf Innovativen Netzen) {{that is designed}} as an ISDN based computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) tool for usage in medical diagnostics. Medical image data from various sources (for example CT nd MR) can be interchanged and analyzed in bilateral teleconferences via ISDN. During a cooperative session user interactions for image processing etc. are synchronized and performed on both workstations. Features like <b>telepointing,</b> remote control, and audio connection enhance communication quality. With ISDN as transmission line widespread availability and low communication costs are achieved. Further, automatic tissue labeling in intracranial MR data can be invoked. For this purpose artificial neural network classifiers such as multilayer perceptron and Kohonen feature map are integrated. Classification results {{can be viewed as}} 3 D-reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the paper}} the {{integration}} of 3 D building models {{in the context of}} location aware services is presented by two exemplary applications. First the intuitive access to object related information within an urban environment is by <b>telepointing</b> is described. For that purpose terrestrial images are mapped against a 3 D model of the environment based on direct georeferencing and a image based localisation of depicted buildings. The oriented image then allows for the access to information related to the depicted objects by pointing to the respective image sections. Secondly, the paper presents an approach for the generalisation of 3 D building models with regard to the visualisation of urban landscapes. Especially for applications such as web-based 3 D GIS and the presentation of virtual walk-throughs on mobile computing devices, these generated representations of the 3 D models are a prerequisite in order to generate level of detail structures for real-time rendering. 1...|$|R
40|$|The siftware systen JAMEDIN (Kooperatives Arbeiten und MEdizinische Diagnostik auf Innovativen Netzen) is a {{multimedia}} telemedicine system for exchange, cooperative diagnostics, and remote analysis of digital medical image data. It provides components for visualisation, processing, and sychronised audio-visual discussion of medical images. Techniques of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) synchronise user interactions during a teleconference. Vsisibility of {{both local and}} remote cursor on the conference workstations facilitates <b>telepointing</b> and reinforces the conference partner's telepresence. Audio communication during teleconferences is supported by an integrated audio component. Furthermore, brain tissue segmentation with artificaial neural networks can be performed on an external supercomputer as a remote image analysis procedure. KAMEDIN is designed as a low cost CSCW tool for ISDN based telecommunication. However {{it can be used}} on any TCP/IP supporting network. In a field test, KAMEDIN was installed in 15 clinics and medical departments to validate the systems' usability. The telemedicine system KAMEDIN has been developed, tested, and evaluated within a research project sponsored by German Telekom...|$|R

This paper presents the design and development of a telemedicine distributed system for cooperative medical diagnosis based on two new approaches: 1) a distributed layered architecture specially designed to add synchronous computer supported cooperative work features either to new or existing medical applications; 2) the definition of a methodological procedure to design graphical user interfaces for telemedicine cooperative working scenarios. The cooperative work is supported by a collaborative toolkit that provides <b>telepointing,</b> window sharing, coordination and synchronization.

40|$|Stereoscopic <b>telepointing</b> to be {{employed}} inter alia in cooperative telework applications yields many benefits but also poses {{a number of problems}} addressed in a study with 96 subjects under four different conditions. For two conditions, 3 D-input devices were designed implementing different input metaphors. The 'Light Beam Metaphor' is analogous to pointing to objects with a slide show pointer or laser pointer. The 'Reference Space Metaphor' provides the users with the possibility of pointing to details of an object {{in such a way as}} if a re-sized model of the object was present in front of them and within reach of their hands. The other two conditions were stereoscopic and monoscopic control conditions without pointers. The subjects' task was to identify differences between a remote and a local object within a limited time. The results show that the Light Beam Metaphor pointer was easier to handle and conformed to a larger degree to the users' expectations, whereas the Reference Space Metaphor pointer received better subjective ratings on efficiency and Telepresence. The analysis of the results of all four conditions established the benefits of 3 D over 2 D representations for object-oriented communicative situations in terms of appeal and the impression of depth...|$|R
