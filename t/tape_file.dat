The IBM implementation of this file system has been released as the open-source IBM Linear <b>Tape</b> <b>File</b> System — Single Drive Edition (LTFS-SDE) product. The Linear <b>Tape</b> <b>File</b> System uses a separate partition on the tape to record the index meta-data, thereby avoiding {{the problems associated with}} scattering directory entries across the entire tape.|$|E

50|$|An IOCS program {{must create}} a control block for each file, specifying {{information}} {{unique to the}} file.

50|$|The initial versions, George 1 (for the ICT 1901, 1902 and 1903 machines) was {{a simple}} batch {{processing}} system. Job descriptions were read in from cards or paper tape, peripherals and magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> were dynamically allocated to the job which was then run, producing output on the line printer.|$|R
5000|$|The mtap & ptap are MS-DOS {{tools for}} {{creating}} real <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> (.TAP files) from original C64, VIC-20 and C16 tapes using the Commodore Datasette, and for playing back [...]TAP <b>files</b> to real <b>tapes</b> {{for use with}} an actual Commodore 64 machine. mtap & ptap were developed in 1998-2002 by Markus Brenner.|$|R
50|$|The Linear <b>Tape</b> <b>File</b> System (LTFS) is a self-describing tape {{format and}} file system made {{possible}} by the partition feature. File data and filesystem metadata are stored in separate partitions on the tape. The metadata, which uses a standard XML schema, is readable by any LTFS-aware system and can be modified separately from the data it describes. The Linear <b>Tape</b> <b>File</b> System Technical Work Group of the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) works {{on the development of the}} format for LTFS.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Quantum {{introduced}} its Scalar LTFS (Linear <b>Tape</b> <b>File</b> System) appliance, which offers new modes of portability and user accessibility for archived content on LTO tape.|$|E
50|$|While LTFS {{can make}} a tape appear to behave like a disk, it {{does not change the}} {{fundamentally}} sequential nature of <b>tape.</b> <b>Files</b> are always appended {{to the end of the}} <b>tape.</b> If a <b>file</b> is modified and overwritten or removed from the volume, the associated tape blocks used are not freed up: they are simply marked as unavailable, and the used volume capacity is not recovered. Data is deleted and capacity recovered only if the whole tape is reformatted.|$|R
40|$|Recovering evidential {{data from}} {{magnetic}} tapes in a forensically sound manner {{is a difficult}} task. There are many different tape technologies in existence today and an even greater number of archive formats used. This paper discusses the issues and challenges involved in the forensic acquisition and analysis of magnetic tapes. It identifies areas of slack space on tapes and discusses the challenges of low level acquisition of an entire length of tape. It suggests a basic methodology for determining {{the contents of a}} <b>tape,</b> acquiring <b>tape</b> <b>files,</b> and preparing them for forensic analysis. Keywords: Digital Forensics, Tape Forensics, Backup Forensics, Backup tape acquisition, Magnetic tape acquisition. Please note that ”tape files ” in this paper refers to SCSI <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> defined by the SCSI Stream Commands (SSC- 3) standard. It does NOT refer to files contained within backup archives created by various backup programs (ARCserve, NTBackup, ufsdump, etc). ...|$|R
50|$|Both DOS and OS JCL have {{a maximum}} usable line length of 80 characters, because when DOS/360 and OS/360 were first used the main method of {{providing}} new input {{to a computer}} system was 80-column punched cards. It later became possible to submit jobs via disk or <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> with longer record lengths, but the operating system's job submission components ignored everything after character 80.|$|R

40|$|Lustre, {{the central}} GSI file system for {{experiment}} data, is mounted now on each gStore data mover {{and supported by}} all appropriate actions of the command gstore. This has several advantages: 1. Data are transferred directly between gStore storage and lustre filesystem. The (desktop) node requesting the action via gstore command {{is not involved in}} the data transfer. As a result the data transfer rates between gStore data movers and lustre are up to the order of 100 MB/s. 2. The gStore clients initiating the data transfer don't need a mount to lustre. 3. Load balancing is available not only on the gStore server side, but also on the lustre client side utilizing the load balancing mechanisms of lustre. As the data transfer rates between gStore tape and lustre are limited by tape speed currently, <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> are retrieved directly to lustre and not- as elsewhere in gStore- via read cache. However, the general rule to access <b>tape</b> <b>files</b> with as few gstore commands as possible should also be followed in this case {{to reduce the number of}} tape mounts (see also chapter 3 below). When archiving files from lustre to gStore, the data are stored as usual at first in the gStore writ...|$|R

Nominal geometric corrections which provide proper geodetic relationships between different parts of the image are available only for the CCT-PT. It is concluded that detector 3 of band 5 on the TM does not respond; this channel of data needs replacement.
