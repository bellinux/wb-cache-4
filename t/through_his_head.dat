5|$|A Team D.A.D.D.Y. {{directed}} {{music video}} {{was made to}} accompany the track's release as a single. The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. Two different endings for the video were produced - in one Santa Claus is shown crucified on a cross while another sees Santa laid {{on the floor with}} an arrow <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a spoilt child opening {{numerous}} Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens {{and a copy of}} Hey Venus! (which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Daryl (Norman Reedus) {{has been}} forced to travel with the Claimers, led by Joe (Jeff Kober). Daryl gets into a {{confrontation}} with Len (Marcus Hester) over a claim on who shot, and thus owns, a rabbit, and Joe informs Daryl of the rules, then splits the rabbit's meat between then. That night, when they rest, Len sneaks his half of the rabbit into Daryl's bag, and feigns the next morning that Daryl took it. Joe, however, reports he saw Len frame Daryl, and drags him away to beat him up. Joe returns alone and instructs the others to pack up and move out. As they walk away, Daryl's sees Len's dead body, an arrow struck <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> They come across the train tracks and discover the candy wrapped left behind by Rick.|$|E
25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while {{she stares at the}} sky, coming to grips with what has happened.|$|E

50|$|Hateley {{started his}} career with Notts County, where he first {{established}} himself as a prolific goalscorer, especially <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>heading</b> ability, and scored 77 league goals in 131 matches. The club won promotion to the Third Division in 1960-61, while Hateley's goals earned him a move to County's Midlands rivals Aston Villa in 1963. Hateley continued his prolific scoring record at Villa, once scoring four second-half goals as Villa came from 5-1 down to draw 5-5 with Tottenham Hotspur, and his 86 goals in less than 150 games played a significant part in saving the club from relegation to the Second Division. In October 1966 Chelsea's offer of £100,000 for Hateley was accepted and he moved to west London. Such was his importance to Villa, they were relegated {{at the end of the}} 1966-67 season.|$|R
25|$|During {{the relief}} attempt Vere was {{inspecting}} the English trenches when heavy fighting broke {{out as a}} sally was launched on the position. The Spanish were repelled but Vere was severely injured when a bullet went <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> beneath his eye and became embedded in his skull. For Vere {{it would be the}} end of the war but the bullet was removed as he took up rest in Ryswick and was not able to take to the field again by the end of the year. As a consequence of Vere's wound the young Frederick Henry who was only eighteen years old took over Vere's command, while Horace Vere (brother to Francis) took over the English troops in the field. The Earl of Leicester arrived at the siege in late August in case Francis' wound was mortal and needed to fill in his command but this was denied by Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
500|$|Morrison did not {{excel at}} academics, and focused instead on music. He practised his music in solitude, {{and was not}} skilled at socialising. [...] "One time {{he said to me}} it wasn't that he didn't want to talk, but tunes were running <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> all the time. He said he didn't know whether he'd been blessed or cursed because the words and music wouldn't go out of his head," [...] said his mother Violet.|$|E
500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I wonder whether Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> already." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the land}} operations, Lieutenant Watson of Calliope and other {{officers}} boarded Cambridge, and soon captured {{it after a}} resistance from the few Chinese crew that remained. The ship was found to mount 34 guns. Orders {{were sent to the}} officer to set it on fire. Shortly after dark, the fire exploded its magazine, hurling the masts and beams in the air. Herbert wrote that the explosion was so loud that it [...] "must have been heard at Canton." [...] A total of 98 Chinese guns were captured during the day. The British casualties were one seaman killed, six seamen wounded, and two marines wounded. The seaman who died on Modeste had the hammer of his musket caught on the ship's thwart and when the piece discharged, the ball shot <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

2500|$|During {{the next}} two years Gustavus Adolphus marched across a devastated Germany, conquering Pomerania and Mecklenburg. In early November 1632 he went to Erfurt to say goodbye to Maria Eleonora, who had been in Germany since the {{previous}} winter. In the Battle of Lützen, the 37-year-old Gustavus Adolphus was shot in the back. He fell and was dragged for some distance by his horse. He managed to free himself from the stirrup, but while lying on the ground [...] "The Lion of the North" [...] was killed by another shot <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> By nightfall both armies were exhausted, but Bernard of Saxe-Weimar and the Swedes had captured all the Imperial artillery and were in possession of the key position. The king's body was found lying face downwards in the mud, plundered of everything but his shirt.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1768 the Ottoman Empire {{declared}} war on the Russian Empress Catherine the Great. Two years later, Kutuzov, now a major, joined {{the army of the}} soon-to-be-famous Count Pyotr Rumyantsev in the south to fight against the Turks. Though Kutuzov served valiantly in this campaign, he did not receive any medals, as another officer reported to Rumyantsev that Kutuzov mocked Rumyantsev behind his back. [...] Rumyantsev had Lieutenant-Colonel Kutuzov transferred into Prince Vasily Dolgorukov-Krymsky's Russian Second Army fighting the Turks and the Tatars in the Crimea. During this campaign Kutuzov learned how to use the deadly Cossack cavalry, another skill which would prove useful in the defence of Russia against Napoleon's invading armies in 1812. In 1773 he was ordered to storm the well-defended town of Alushta on the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula. [...] When his troops' advance [...] faltered, Kutuzov grabbed the fallen regimental standard and led the attack. While charging forward, he was shot in the left temple—an almost certainly fatal wound at the time. The bullet went right <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and exited near the right eye. However, Kutuzov slowly recovered, though frequently overcome by sharp pains and dizziness, and his right eye remained permanently twisted. [...] He left the army later that year due to his wound.|$|E
2500|$|Ewell {{began his}} attack immediately, around 3:30p.m., {{without waiting for}} his entire {{division}} to come on line. General Lee's instructions were to advance along the same axis used by the brigades of Gregg and Branch, to maintain {{the momentum of the}} attack. He sent in his lead brigade, Louisianans under Col. Isaac Seymour, commanding in Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor's absence for medical reasons. Seymour was relatively inexperienced and his troops became confused in the woods and bogs of Boatswain's Swamp. Their confusion [...] increased when Col. Seymour was killed by a Union rifle volley. Maj. Roberdeau Wheat, the colorful leader of the Louisiana Tigers Battalion, moved to the front to lead the brigade, but he was also killed with a bullet <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The Louisiana Brigade withdrew from the battle. Ewell's attack continued with two regiments from the brigade of Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, but they could not advance beyond the swamp, falling with about 20% casualties. Porter was starting to receive reinforcements from Slocum's division and he brought forward troops to feed into gaps in his line. However, despite telegrams from Porter for more assistance, General McClellan gave no thought to the advantages of a counterattack. He asked his corps commanders south of the river whether they had any troops they could spare. When no one volunteered, he directed Sumner of the II Corps to send two brigadesabout one tenth of the armyacross the river, but because of the distances involved they would not reach the scene for another three hours.|$|E

A large red cotton one formed a sort of plaid; a blue one with a hole in the middle, <b>through</b> which <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was thrust, served as a pretty good poncho or tippet; a green one with white spots, tied round the loins, did duty as a tunic or kilt; and one of crimson silk round the head formed a gorgeous turban.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that {{the strength of the}} Dubois Brothers was built from the trust that they had between them, they were said to have made a gang of perfect cohesion in their neighbourhood who few would compete against. They were built their criminal organization and power on intimidation and violence; they reigned like crime lords over illegitimate and legitimate businesses in their controlled territories. The Quebec Police Commission gave them a great compliment when they stated in 1977 in their report: [...] "Some maintain that the ruthless methods of the Dubois, the large number of toughs gravitating about each of the nine brothers, as well as the widely dreaded cruelty of their hirelings, make them the most influential criminal group at the present time on the island of Montreal." [...] The network that the Dubois Brothers organized was made up of about two hundred men loosely organized into independent gangs of several dozen members with the brothers at the centre of this organization. Even the Dubois Brother’s number one hitman, Donald Lavoie, was scared of the brothers because he claimed that they were too powerful and he believed that one day Claude Dubois would put a bullet <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The Dubois Brothers were not considered ones to hold back, they acted when to the degree they thought was necessary regardless of the cost which was reaffirmed the cruelty they demonstrated to their victims and foes that in turn shaped their reputation. Instances such as when a restaurant owner stood up to the Brothers insisting that they needed to pay for their food which resulted in him being beat up and a knife taken to his chest in order to carve a cross in it. Events such as this one left people fearful of the Dubois Brothers and reinforced their supremacy.|$|E
