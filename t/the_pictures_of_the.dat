25|$|Emoji are {{pictograms}} {{that can}} be used and displayed inline with text. They are similar to previous symbol typefaces, but with a much larger range of characters, such as symbols for common objects, animals, food types, weather and emotions. Originally developed in Japan, they are now commonly installed on many computer and smartphone operating systems. Following standardisation and inclusion in the Unicode standard, allowing them to be used internationally, the number of Emoji characters has rapidly increased {{to meet the demands of}} an expanded range of cultures using them; unlike many previous symbol typefaces, they are interchangeable with the ability to display <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same meaning in a range of fonts on different operating systems. The popularity of emoji has meant that characters have sometimes gained culture-specific meanings not inherent to the design. Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{may have}} saved the most {{personal}} side of his creativity for his approach to Russian folklore. Folklorism as practiced by Balakirev {{and the other members}} of The Five had been based largely on the protyazhnaya dance song. Protyazhnaya literally meant [...] "drawn-out song", or melismatically elaborated lyric song. The characteristics of this song exhibit extreme rhythmic flexibility, an asymmetrical phrase structure and tonal ambiguity. After composing May Night, Rimsky-Korsakov was increasingly drawn to [...] "calendar songs", which were written for specific ritual occasions. The ties to folk culture was what interested him most in folk music, even in his days with The Five; these songs formed a part of rural customs, echoed old Slavic paganism, and the pantheistic world of folk rites. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections. He wrote that he [...] "was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun-worship, and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me, as it then seemed, with great clarity, luring me on with the charm of antiquity. These occupations subsequently had a great influence in the direction of my own activity as a composer".|$|E
