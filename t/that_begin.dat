5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> at Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements. Most {{of the southern}} portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions. Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road, while north of there it follows The Cameron Road, a trail carved in the 1850s between Fenelon and Minden. North of Minden, the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon Road, a colonization road built {{as far north as}} Dwight in the 1850s.|$|E
2500|$|For A to be {{strictly}} ahead of B throughout the counting of the votes, {{there can be}} no ties. [...] Separate the counting sequences according to the first vote. [...] Any sequence <b>that</b> <b>begins</b> with a vote for B must reach a tie at some point, because A eventually wins. [...] For any sequence <b>that</b> <b>begins</b> with A and reaches a tie, reflect the votes up to the point of the first tie (so any A becomes a B, and vice versa) to obtain a sequence <b>that</b> <b>begins</b> with B. [...] Hence every sequence <b>that</b> <b>begins</b> with A and reaches a tie is in one-to-one correspondence with a sequence <b>that</b> <b>begins</b> with B, and the probability <b>that</b> a sequence <b>begins</b> with B is , so the probability that A always leads the vote is ...|$|R

5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|Shabbat {{lunch is}} also an {{important}} social meal. Since antiquity, Jewish communities all over the world devised meat casseroles <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> cooking before the lighting of candles that marks the commencement of the Sabbath on Friday night, so as to comply with the religious regulations for observing the Sabbath. In modern Israel, this filling dish, in many variations, is still eaten on the Sabbath day, not only in religiously observant households, and is also served in some restaurants during the week.|$|E

Clark must deal with the meteor-infected individuals <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> appearing in Smallville, his love for Lana Lang (Kreuk), {{and not being able}} to tell his two best friends, Pete Ross (Jones III) and Chloe Sullivan (Mack), about his abilities or his origins. Clark also befriends Lex Luthor (Rosenbaum) after saving Lex's life. The season also follows Lex, as he tries to assert his independence from his father, Lionel Luthor (John Glover).|$|E
5|$|Unlike most sports, college football's {{governing}} body, the NCAA, {{does not}} bestow a National Championship title. That title is bestowed {{by one or}} more of four different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> in the preseason: the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. Two additional polls are released midway through the season; the Harris Interactive Poll is released after the fourth week of the season and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Standings is released after the seventh week.

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> the replication cycle anew.|$|E
5|$|The lower seating bowl {{is divided}} into 24 {{sections}} and wraps around the playing field from one foul pole to the other. The second level has 16sections of seating <b>that</b> <b>begin</b> behind third base and wrap around to first base.

All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have padded seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have padded seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.|$|E
