5|$|The hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda {{states that}} deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (rudra), another that is kind and {{tranquil}} (shiva). The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> (vahana) of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts {{such as the}} Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian zebu, in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35inches (161mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from {{four days of}} rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20homes were destroyed, and 20villages were left without power. A <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> carrying 15people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the truck was later rescued by police workers. About 300hectares (740acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended. Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000people, and initially there were two people missing; however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.|$|E

The children were returned to Lagganlia while Beattie and Paisley drove to the ski centre where they were unable to learn any news. They then went to Glenmore Lodge and then Aviemore police station where at 19:00 they reported Davidson's party missing. Three pairs of rescuers were immediately dispatched from Glenmore Lodge into the blizzard and the night and the Cairngorm, RAF Kinloss, Braemar and Aberdeen MRTs were called out. The mountain rescue teams made their preparations so they could start off hours before first light on Monday.|$|E

On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note that {{the door to the}} Waste Collection System in shuttle's mid-deck flew open during entry.

25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle,</b> where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen {{to the back of the}} house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to a member of the national committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E
