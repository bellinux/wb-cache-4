40|$|Mapping and {{modelling}} {{the complicated}} geometry of caves is a challenging task that {{has traditionally been}} undertaken by <b>tacheometric</b> <b>surveying</b> methods. These methods are excellent for capturing the general shape of a cave system {{but they are not}} suitable for high-speed, high-resolution mapping of complex surfaces found in this environment. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technologies can acquire millions of points represented by 3 -D coordinates, at very high spatial densities on complex multifaceted surfaces within minutes. In the last few years, advances in measurement speed, reduction in size / cost and increased portability of this technology has revolutionised the collection of 3 -D data. This paper discusses the methodological framework and the advantages / disadvantages of adopting terrestrial laser scanning to rapidly map a complex cave system on the example of the Domica Cave in Slovakia. This cave originated in the largest karst region in the West Carpathians. The collected data set or ‘point cloud’ contains over 11. 9 billion measured points, captured in 5 days from 327 individual scanning positions. The dataset represents almost 1600 m of the cave passages. Semi-automatic registration of these scans was carried out using reference spheres placed in each scene and this method archived an overall registration error of 2. 24 mm (RMSE). Transformation of the final registered point cloud from its local coordinate system to the national cartographic system was achieved with total accuracy of 21 mm (RMSE). This very detailed data set was used to create a 3 -D cave surface model needed for volumetric analyses. In the future, it will be used for spatial analyses or simulating the interaction of surface and subsurface processes contributing {{to the development of the}} cave system on the basis of a 3 -D GIS platform. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{dynamics}} and functions of a coastal dunefield at the Bushman’s River Mouth in Kenton-on-Sea was conducted to provide essential information for the formulation of a management strategy based on an ecosystem approach. Bi-monthly <b>tacheometric</b> <b>surveys</b> were undertaken at the Westbourne Road Car Park dunefield to investigate the sedimentological processes. Changes in the topography, the amount and rate of sand accretion were monitored. Accretion and progradation were the dominant long-term sedimentological processes at the site. Long-term spatial variation in these processes corresponded to the temporal pattern of sedimentation in the river mouth while short-term variation resulted from dynamics inherent to the types of dunes present. Factors affecting aeolian accretion at the site are topography, river mouth configuration, dune types {{and the presence of}} vegetation as well as the seasonal wind regime. A vegetation study, recording species present, cover and abundance of the plants along the surveyed transects, was also conducted to examine the progressive establishment of vegetation. Five plant communities were discerned namely, saltmarsh, pioneer, enriched pioneer, open scrub, closed scrub and scrub-thicket communities. The spatial distribution of these communities coincided with the north-westerly development of the sandbank. A successional trend in community change occurred along a gradient of increasing diversity, complexity and age. Initially, autogenic changes wrought by pioneer species facilitated the recruitment and survival of other species and commenced succession at the study site. Multiple successional pathways were discussed in relation to subsequent species establishment that occurred after facilitation. The amalgamation of ecological data with a social study in the form of public perception surveys allowed for a greater understanding of the present interactions between the ecosystem and the demands placed on it. The area primarily functions as a recreational site that offered numerous beach and water-related activities. A lack of information regarding the ecology and management programmes influenced public perception of the environment and management issues in general. Different management perspectives {{and the use of the}} information presented in this study were also discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{construction}} of the underground station called Place des Martyrs in Algiers required preventive excavation. The context led us to favour recording methods leading to the rapid and exhaustive acquisition of data. Indeed digital photogrammetry {{made it possible to}} measure complex elements simply and rapidly. The originality of the solution implemented resided in the use of a free and open-source applications suite dedicated to scientific usage and making it possible to generate 3 D models similar to those obtained by lasergramme-try. More than 1500 shots were acquired during this first measurement campaign. Plans and sections were extracted on request from the scatter plot. <b>Tacheometric</b> <b>survey</b> operations were reduced to measuring only control points required for geo-referencing images. The digital photogrammetric survey of such a volume of remains in a preventive archaeological context in an urban environment is to our knowledge unique. The importance of this case study also resided in the use of a fully free and open-source professional applications suite. In the end, this method could be used regularly on other similar excavations...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial {{photogrammetry}} enables rapid {{survey to}} be {{undertaken in the}} fluvial environment, a crucial factor when assessing highly dynamic features. In addition, it permits the generation of terrain surfaces {{at a level of}} detail which, given equal time constraints in the field, far exceeds the detail permitted by conventional <b>tacheometric</b> <b>survey.</b> This study details the levels of accuracy that can be achieved using the RolleiMetric Close-range Digital Workstation (CDW) photogrammetric survey technique on a variety of low relief fluvial geomorphic features (lateral, point and mid-channel bars) ranging from 10 m 2 to 100 m 2. The CDW software processes image data from an array of photographs and establishes a set of three-dimensional co-ordinates for the photographed object. The accuracies achieved across all bar surfaces were well within the resolution defined by the maximum size of the gravel on the bar surface (mean errors were between 0 · 026 and 0 · 057 m). The use of CDW photogrammetry does not require experienced personnel; however, care must be taken during the survey to minimize edge effects and to ensure that target density is sufficient to produce a terrain model that is accurate to within the limits of the surface sediment size. Guidance on target density as a function of terrain roughness is given to aid the user. A methodology is suggested that will allow CDW to be incorporated into sediment budgeting techniques, improving the level of achievable accuracy...|$|E
