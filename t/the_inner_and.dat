40|$|A {{process for}} {{producing}} seamless metal-clad composite structures includes providing a hollow, metallic <b>inner</b> member <b>and</b> an outer sleeve to surround <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member <b>and</b> define an <b>inner</b> space therebetween. A plurality of continuous reinforcing fibers {{is attached to}} the distal end of the outside diameter of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member is then introduced, distal end first, into one end of the outer sleeve. <b>The</b> <b>inner</b> member is then moved, distal end first, into the outer sleeve until <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member is completely enveloped by the outer sleeve. A liquid matrix material is then injected into the space containing the reinforcing fibers between <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member <b>and</b> <b>the</b> outer sleeve. Next a pressurized heat transfer medium is passed through <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member to cure the liquid matrix material. Finally, the wall thickness of both <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> member <b>and</b> <b>the</b> outer sleeve are reduced to desired dimensions by chemical etching, which adjusts the thermal expansion coefficient of the metal-clad composite structure to a desired value...|$|R

5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, {{it is necessary to}} asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E

5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet {{is based on}} phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin {{and a variety of}} glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>and</b> Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{increasingly}} rigorously maintained, {{and during the}} 1910s and 1920s the larger trees around the castle were cut down, and the animals were cleared from <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer baileys {{on the basis that}} they posed a health and safety risk to visitors. The 1930s saw a major effort to clear the remaining vegetation from the castle, the cellars were cleared of debris by the government's Office of Works and the stable block was converted into a museum. Tourists continued to visit the castle, with the 1920s and 1930s seeing many day-trips by teams of workers in the region encouraged by the growth in motor transport. The open spaces inside the castle were used by the local townsfolk for football matches and similar events, and in 1934 Milton's Comus was restaged in the castle to mark the 300th anniversary of the first such event.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, {{is surrounded by a}} phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced both <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> {{the outer}} walls, {{and a number}} of smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>and</b> outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
