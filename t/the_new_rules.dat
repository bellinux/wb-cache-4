40|$|Some {{aspects of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> for <b>the</b> current account {{have been called}} into {{question}} recently both theoretically and empirically. This note sup-ports the validity of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> (and <b>the</b> extended <b>new</b> <b>rule)</b> to analyze <b>the</b> behavior of current accounts. First, even if <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> does not strictly hold in a two-country world, it is easily extended to a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model just adding an extra term along what <b>the</b> <b>new</b> view dictates. Moreover, <b>the</b> extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> exhibits a two-way asset trade, {{which is consistent with}} the empirical evidence. Second, the cross-sectional empirical evidence is related to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> or <b>the</b> extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> since <b>the</b> steady state may not even exist and, even if it does, it implies that growth rates in both countries are equal de-spite it may not be, and in fact, it is not the case. In addition, some argument is needed to support that the empirical evidence is being gener-ated by the steady state, given the pace of 8 ̆ 5 nancial integration. Finally, the cross-section (between) regression of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> or <b>the</b> extended <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> remains valid to analyze the behavior of current accounts since the accounting-based approximateregression proposed is not, in fact, a good approximation to the true regression.

An adventure, Scepter Tower of Spellgard, was also released in September 2008 and can be used in combination with the adventure in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide to start a Forgotten Realms campaign. In 2008, the Forgotten Realms also became the setting for the RPGA's sole living campaign, Living Forgotten Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk.

5|$|In 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was {{purchased}} by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the D rules to date, and served {{as the basis for}} a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>rules</b> standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5 was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.|$|E

40|$|Every litigator {{who remembers}} first year civil {{procedure}} {{knows that the}} personal jurisdiction 1 of federal courts is limited by state territorial boundaries. That limitation, however, may soon disappear in federal question cases. A <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> of civil procedure, currently under consideration by the federal rulemakers, would provide for nationwide service of process in all federal question cases. The proposed rule would profoundly affect forum selection in the federal courts. This Note argues {{in favor of the}} adoption of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Rule</b> 42 ̆ 7 s nationwide personal jurisdiction provision. Not only would <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Rule</b> 4 be a legitimate exercise of authority, but it might result ultimately in a decrease in litigational inconvenience, which would inure to the benefit of defendants as well as plaintiffs. Finally, using the proposed rule as a springboard to discuss the confused state of current court access doctrine, this Note urges the adoption of more rational and clearly defined distinctions in civil procedure. Part I of this Note analyzes the proposed rule 2 ̆ 7 s nationwide service of process provision. After comparing the operation of the current Rule 4 to the proposed Rule 4, it describes the practical benefits <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> would bring, particularly judicial economy and more vigorous enforcement of federal law. It then identifies the class of cases <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> would affect, concluding that while <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> would make personal jurisdiction obtainable in many more forums than before, venue restrictions would sharply limit <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> 2 ̆ 7 s practical impact on where suits could actually be brought. Part II addresses the criticisms to which the proposed rule seems most vulnerable. The rule might be challenged as a violation of the due process limitations on personal jurisdiction or as an endeavor beyond the scope of the rulemakers 2 ̆ 7 authority. Even if it is constitutional and a valid exercise of authority, the proposal might be challenged as a bad idea, on the ground that expansions of jurisdictional reach cause inconvenience and unfairness to defendants. These objections, Part II argues, prove unpersuasive, though the proposed rule would engender certain problems of inconvenience and unfairness to defendants. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> might enable plaintiffs to harass defendants by bringing suit in inconvenient forums. Part III proposes a response to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> 2 ̆ 7 s problems. The pro- posed rule, Part III argues, will help separate the currently overlapping doctrines of personal jurisdiction, venue, and forum non conveniens, thus enabling those doctrines to filter out inappropriate choices of forum more effectively. Much of the potential unfairness engendered by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> could be prevented by the adoption of restrictive, defendant-oriented venue provisions, and by the vigorous use of venue transfer and forum non conveniens. Finally, Part IV discusses <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>rule</b> 2 ̆ 7 s broader implications for the future, concluding that the proposal heralds a step toward greater rationality in civil procedure doctrine...|$|R

In contrast, Kraay and Ventura (2000, p. 1137) brilliantly argue that “the current account response is equal to the saving generated by the shock multiplied by the country’s share of foreign assets in total assets”, which they have termed “the new rule”.
