5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large relative to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> (or equivalently when <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that {{take advantage of}} the parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> to be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E

This mode is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Players {{can find}} loot (such as clothing, weapons, and armor) {{throughout}} the game world and collect it. Players can trade items for currency and better equipment. Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized trading screen. Purchased items {{go into the}} player's inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting {{the size of the}} player's inventory, thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time. This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> that can be held.|$|E
25|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{dedicated}} to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed {{of a number of}} stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays (e.g., Luck & Vogel, 1997). Performance is critically dependent on <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|Notification Center {{was added}} in the {{operating}} system. It {{provides an overview of}} alerts from applications and displays notifications until the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant resolution. Users may choose what applications appear in Notification Center, and how they are handled. There are three types of notifications: banners, alerts, and badges. Banners are displayed {{for a short period of}} time in the upper right corner of the Mac's screen, and then slide off to the right. The icon of the application is displayed on the left side of the banner, while the message from the application will be displayed on the right side. Alerts are the same as banners, but will not disappear from the screen until the user takes action. Badges are red notification icons that are displayed on the application's icon. They indicate <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> available for the application.|$|E

The vehicles also have to be decorated on the morning of each stage and, because they must return to ordinary highway standards, disassembled after each stage. Numbers vary but there are normally around 250 vehicles each year. Their order on the road is established by contract, the leading vehicles belonging to the largest sponsors.|$|E

500|$|Miller's 1967 work, The Psychology of Communication, was a {{collection}} of seven previously published articles. The first [...] "Information and Memory" [...] dealt with chunking, presenting the idea of separating physical length (<b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> presented to be learned) and psychological length (the number of ideas the recipient manages to categorize and summarize the items with). Capacity of short-term memory was measured in units of psychological length, arguing against a pure behaviorist interpretation since meaning of items, beyond reinforcement and punishment, was central to psychological length.|$|E
40|$|The item count technique, used {{often to}} {{investigate}} illegal or socially undesirable behaviors, requires respondents to indicate merely <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>items</b> from among a list. However, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>items</b> indicated via the item count question {{tends to be}} smaller than when it is calculated from the direct 'applies/ does not apply' responses to each item. Because this inconsistency, which we {{refer to as the}} underreporting effect, often disturbs proper item count estimates, the causes of this effect are explored in this paper. Web survey results revealed that the order of the response alternatives is irrelevant to the underreporting effect, and that the underreporting effect is caused by the response format in which the item count question requests merely <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> applicable <b>items</b> and not <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-applicable <b>items.</b> It is also shown that the magnitude of the underreporting effect decreases when the respondents are asked to indicate <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> both applicable and non-applicable items, which the authors refer to as elaborate item count questioning.
