25|$|In 2008, it was revived by the Stephen Joseph Company, {{along with}} its {{originating}} play Haunting Julia {{as part of a}} trilogy named <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> <b>Go</b> Bump, with a new third play, Life and Beth, that combined the casts of the two plays. Susie Blake reprised her role as Miriam. The other two roles were played by Liza Goddard as Annabel and Ruth Gibson as Susie.|$|E
25|$|Snake in the Grass is a 2002 play by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn. The play {{is about}} a middle-aged older sister who returns to the family home where her younger sister still lives, shortly after their abusive father's death. It was written as a female {{companion}} piece to the 1994 ghost play Haunting Julia, and in 2008 these two plays, together with new play Life and Beth were folded into a trilogy named <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> <b>Go</b> Bump.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
25|$|Also {{included}} in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of looking at <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>went</b> well and analyzing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>went</b> badly on the project {{to come up with}} lessons learned.|$|R

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
500|$|After {{years of}} development, {{a feature film}} {{adaptation}} of The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the title character. He was {{executive producer of the}} movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120million budget. [...] "It's insane. But it's not so much the specific amount of money that's stressful, it's all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> along with making a movie of that size." [...] The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter. The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it [...] "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie" [...] and the Arizona Republics Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart. Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225million.|$|E
500|$|The Blair Witch Projects {{found footage}} film {{technique}} received near-universal praise by many and, {{though not the}} first to employ it, has been declared a milestone in film history due to its critical and box office success. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a total of four stars, and called it [...] "an extraordinarily effective horror film". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium". Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie, The Blair Witch Project puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> bump in the night." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade, saying, [...] "As a horror picture, the film may not be much more than a cheeky game, a novelty with the cool, blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy, it's pretty spooky." ...|$|E

500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E
500|$|Aerosmith's next {{album was}} even more successful. Pump, {{released}} in September 1989, featured three Top Ten singles: [...] "What It Takes", [...] "Janie's Got a Gun", and [...] "Love in an Elevator", {{as well as the}} Top 30 [...] "The Other Side", re-establishing the band as a serious musical force. Pump was a critical and commercial success, eventually selling 7 million copies, spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV, and achieving four-star ratings from major music magazines. Pump ranked as the fourth-bestselling album of 1990. The band also won its first Grammy in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun". In addition, the video for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun" [...] won two Video Music Awards and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by Rolling Stone, MTV, and VH1. Like Permanent Vacation, Pump was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who added production touches such as instrumental interludes that provided transitions between songs to give the album a more complete sound, as well as the Margarita Horns, who added horns to tracks such as [...] "Love in an Elevator" [...] and [...] "The Other Side". Rock critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that Pump [...] "revels in [...] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith's dirty hard rock core", going on to say that, [...] "such ambition and successful musical eclectism make Pump rank with Toys in the Attic and Rocks." [...] The recording process for Pump was documented in the video The Making of Pump, which has since been re-released as a DVD. The music videos for the album's singles were featured on the release <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> <b>Go</b> Pump in the Night, which quickly went platinum.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it with you because it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>go</b> on." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{play was}} written {{specifically}} for the round, unlike Haunting Julia that was written for the proscenium but sometimes staged in the round for various practical reasons.

2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party.

And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes.
