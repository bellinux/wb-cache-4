50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{variously}} {{considered a}} part of the Vatican Library and Vatican Museums. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> now used for the Vatican Collection of Modern Religious Art, inaugurated by Pope Paul VI in 1973.|$|R
50|$|The doors between <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> made crooked {{on purpose}} {{so that they}} would close by {{themselves}} and not let the heat out. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> not heated and foot warmers were used in the winter.|$|R
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|After Paul {{wakes up}} and {{mentions}} that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} occurring in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> far {{older than the}} house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 4: <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> a {{survival}} horror video game, the fourth installment in the Silent Hill series, published by Konami and developed by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The game {{was released in}} Japan in June 2004 and in North America and Europe in September of the same year. Silent Hill 4 was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. Its soundtrack was released at the same time. In 2012, it was released on the Japanese PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|The Dillon Drawing Room, {{which was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Lee Drawing Room, was renamed in honor of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon, who donated its unique wallpaper, a Chinese print from 1770. Dillon's wife Phyllis purchased the wallpaper {{on the recommendation of}} interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964. The wallpaper was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. The Dillon Drawing Room is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|E

5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In this case, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on and turned off".|$|R

5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a chequer board pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|The Princess of Wales Bedroom {{is named}} after {{the wife of the}} future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although the fabric of the four-poster bed was {{designed}} in 1911, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary Bedroom {{is named after}} Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains a bed with an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with needlework created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of Needlework.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> a 2003 American {{independent}} romantic drama film starring, written, directed, {{and produced}} by Tommy Wiseau. The film is primarily {{centered on a}} melodramatic love triangle among an amiable banker named Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive fiancée Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). A {{significant portion of the}} film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> dining <b>room,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> size <b>was</b> {{increased by}} {{the construction of}} a bay window, parquet floor <b>was</b> installed, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fireplace mantel. <b>The</b> Pink <b>Room,</b> named for <b>the</b> pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|R
50|$|In 1936-1937, {{the school}} {{district}} took advantage of federal Public Works Administration funds to add two classrooms, hallways, and restrooms. Heat for <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>was</b> provided by a boiler system, which replaced the wood-burning stoves used in the original classrooms. <b>The</b> intact boiler <b>room</b> <b>is</b> located in a small subfloor area underneath the boys’ restroom. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> eventually equipped with oil heaters, and eventually gas heaters hung from the ceilings.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> catered for 150 {{standing}} in the buffet, and 112 seated in <b>the</b> dining <b>room,</b> and <b>was</b> staffed at its peak by 34 employees {{who lived in a}} cottage complex near the station. By 1976 <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> in decline, serving light refreshments only by a staff of only 11. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> closed on 8 October 1981 when on-train catering was rolled out to all trains passing though the station. <b>The</b> buffet <b>room</b> <b>was</b> refurbished in 1993-1995 for community uses, but <b>the</b> dining <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used for storage.|$|R
5|$|The case of Newirth's death, {{the latest}} in several of its kind, is {{assigned}} to local detective Kelly Ryan (Kate Twa). She seeks help from Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her former instructor at the FBI Academy. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) also takes part in the investigation, believing Newirth died from spontaneous human combustion. While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor; because <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen. After he leaves, Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area. Despite Banton's warnings, the officers step into his shadow and disappear, leaving more burn marks.|$|E
5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the elephant in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>is</b> a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh and not from Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
5|$|The second floor, in {{addition}} to housing the gubernatorial offices, features the Gallery of Governors with portraits of former Michigan Governors {{on the walls of}} the rotunda; the gallery extends up to the third floor. The governor's offices were among the most extensively restored during the 1989–1992 restoration. The office features a suite of original furnishings manufactured in 1876 by the Feige Brothers Company of Saginaw. The former chambers of the Michigan Supreme Court are in the south wing of the building. The court vacated its chambers in 1970 for larger quarters, eventually moving to its current location in the Michigan Hall of Justice. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> now used by the Senate Appropriations Committee and named for longtime chairman Harry Gast.|$|E

50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} three rooms, {{and all of}} the walls are stuccoed. From east to west, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> used for office space and product display, shipping and receiving, and storage. <b>The</b> office <b>room</b> <b>was</b> originally floored with linoleum, although carpet <b>was</b> added later. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> originally only split into two areas, the office area having a pressed tin ceiling, but a vault was added in the 1920s, and a private office was partitioned off in 1941. A computer <b>room</b> <b>was</b> later built in the southeast corner. The shipping and receiving room contains an elevator in the center of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> which leads to the upper floors. Loading docks are located on either side of <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> storage <b>room</b> <b>is</b> empty except for staircases leading to the upper floors.|$|R
5|$|The {{second of}} the {{principal}} reception rooms, the Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, {{this has always been}} the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean plasterer Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} once more, {{this time}} {{as part of the}} general restoration of the entire building. The craftsmen who had worked with Carlo Scarpa were called upon for the restoration of the boiserie and it was on this occasion that the chairs now present in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> made.|$|R
