5|$|During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{while the}} Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Wushe Incident, since <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> had long played them off {{against each other}} and <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> used Toda and Truku (Taroko) {{collaborators}} to massacre the Tkdaya. Tkdaya land {{was given to the}} Truku (Taroko) and Toda by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> after the incident. The Truku had resisted and fought <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> before in the 1914 Truku war 太魯閣戰爭 but had since been pacified and collaborated with <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> in the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya.|$|E

The next day, however, a U.S. aircraft carrier task force en route to resist <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces advancing on Port Moresby (later {{taking part in the}} Battle of the Coral Sea) struck <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Tulagi landing force in an air attack, destroying or damaging several of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> ships and aircraft involved in the landing operation. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> troops successfully occupied Tulagi and began the construction of a small naval base.|$|E

Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E

5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby {{with the intention of}} trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of the Coral Sea {{frustrated}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> plan {{to capture}} Port Morseby via an amphibious landing, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> attempted {{to capture the}} town by landing the South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range. The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> began their advance, opposed by an ill-prepared CMF brigade designated 'Maroubra Force'. This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force {{but was unable to}} halt it. Two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force on 26 August but <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> continued to make ground and reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby on 16 September. The South Seas Force was forced to withdraw back along the track on this day, however, as supply problems made any further advance impossible and an Allied counter-landing at Buna was feared. Australian forces pursued <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> along the Kokoda Track and forced them into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua in early November. The Allied operations on the Kokoda Track were made possible by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel. The RAAF and USAAF also played an important role throughout the campaign by attacking <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> force's supply lines and airdropping supplies to Australian Army units.|$|E

This situation continued until after <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata.

The 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment was to act as a rearguard on the coast. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman, the commander of Australian II Corps, now urged Wootten to commence a coastal advance to cut <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> supply lines and force Adachi to retreat from the Huon Peninsula if he were not already doing so. Wootten took a more cautious approach. The Battle of Wareo proved that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> intended to defend the area. After a fierce fight, Wootten managed to drive <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> from the high ground around Sattelberg and Gusika. In early December, Adachi ordered all his troops to withdraw to Sio.
