In this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of T-Shape test to friction conditions was evaluated by observing the extrusion height and load curves throughout the normalized stroke (relative to workpiece diameter). Using the finite element code Deform 2 D and assuming plane strain approximation, the effects of changing die geometry to the T-Shape test results were investigated. The sensitivity of the T-Shape test was also improved by introducing the double-sloped T-Shape design. The double-sloped T-Shape test was able to separate the extrusion height curves for shear coefficient of friction 0. 0 to 0. 4 which was unable to distinguish using the original <b>T-Shape</b> <b>setup...</b>|$|E
