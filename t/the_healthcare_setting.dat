40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to determine relationships between patient age and BMI and use of a self-administered dietary assessment website in <b>the</b> primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>setting.</b> Chi- square and ordinal regression models were used to determine the relationships between age and BMI and computer experience, ownership, and usage from 188 patients using a self-administered dietary assessment website over 12 months. One hundred and twenty-five (66. 5 %) female and 63 (33. 5 %) male patients used the website. A total of 72. 9 % were overweight (BMI 425 kg/m 2). Advanced/intermediate computer users were 17. 1 times more likely to own a computer than beginners or patients who had never used a computer.

Although assertiveness is crucial {{when it comes to}} the interpersonal skills possessed by healthcare workers, it has been shown by numerous studies that nurses tend not to be very assertive (Oostrom and Mierlo 2008).
