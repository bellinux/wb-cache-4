Finally, both experience as a mentor and mentoring provided were examined as moderators between career plateauing and work-related attitudes. Three hundred and six government employees located in the southeastern United States completed surveys (50. 08 % response rate). Of those, 110 reported mentor experience and 196 reported no mentor experience. In general, results provided support for <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> job content and hierarchical plateauing and negative work-related attitudes.
