5|$|From 1990 until 2001, No. 2 Squadron was {{stationed}} at HMAS Albatross, where it operated four A-4Ks and two TA-4Ks and trained alongside the Australian Defence Force; several former Australian aircraft {{were among those}} serving with No. 2 Squadron during this period. The RNZAF continued to operate Skyhawks until 13 December 2001, when both of its fighter squadrons were disbanded. In 2012 eight of the A-4Ks were sold to Draken International to provide training support for the US military; six of these aircraft were former A-4Gs. The remaining nine A-4Ks were donated <b>to</b> <b>museums.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the chronicles {{of earlier}} {{travelling}} naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin and especially William Henry Edwards, Wallace {{decided that he}} too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief. Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon Rainforest for their private collections, selling the duplicates <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species.|$|E
5|$|Overton {{continued}} flying {{as a hobby}} {{after the}} military. He built a personal aviation library with 10,000 books, and began collecting and restoring aircraft. By 1999, Overton had acquired and restored over 90 aircraft, donating most <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> and institutions around the United States and abroad. Among this collection are several more Piper Cubs and Ford Trimotor aircraft, which he flew regularly for leisure. He was also active {{in the development of}} a state aviation museum for North Carolina. The Carolinas Aviation Museum, established in 1992, named its library for Overton.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of the main hall is another {{attached}} shrine, though in much more ruined state. The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is bigger than the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} {{missions}} {{as a tourist}} destination, travel agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, the towns' mayors, native communities and other institutions organized the , a five-day tourist event lasting from March 23–27, 2006. Journalists and international tour operators were shown the important tourist attractions, and introduced to the culture through visits <b>to</b> <b>museums,</b> local workshops, various concerts, native dances, high masses, processions, crafts festivals, and local cuisine. The organisers’ goal initially was to raise the number of tourists from 25,000 to 1 million per year over a ten-year period, which would have represented US$400 million of income. Subsequently, {{in the face of}} lack of support from the Bolivian government and the downturn of the national and local economies, a more modest goal of attracting between 200,000 and 250,000 people per annum was established.|$|E

5|$|Although Palmyrene art {{was related}} to that of Greece, it had a {{distinctive}} style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust reliefs which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which {{can be seen as}} a forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} birds in India {{during the colonial}} period began with hunting and it was only later that more careful {{observations}} were made.

25|$|Until 1985, discoveries made in {{the park}} had to be shipped <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> {{throughout}} the world for scientific analysis and display, including the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto in Ontario, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa in Ontario, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, New York State.

However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released <b>to</b> <b>museums.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{this site}} was {{discovered}} and initially researched, the finds were sent <b>to</b> <b>museums</b> {{all around the world}} (as was common at the time). However, because the finds were not wholly cataloged, there is no comprehensive list of all finds from Kariandusi. To understand the scope of the assemblage, consider that Cambridge University alone has over 250 handaxes from Kariandusi. Obsidian was the main material used in making the Acheulean handaxes, but lava-based materials like quartz-trachyte were also used.|$|E
25|$|After a {{short period}} of service, many {{inhabitants}} of Potsdam noticed noises during the operation of the cars louder than those of the previously used Tatra cars.

The shortage was aggravated by the fact that several old cars had been sold to Hungary just a month before.|$|E
