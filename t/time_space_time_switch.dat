The new approach works jointly in the Fourier and <b>space</b> <b>time</b> domains and, in contrast to existing <b>space</b> <b>time</b> approaches that mainly work for time frequency separated signals, efficiently handles multiple signals with significant time frequency overlap. The proposed method begins by exploiting the slowness (phase and group) and time location estimates based on frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain sparsity penalized broadband dispersion extraction method as presented in AeronTSP 2011. In this context we first present a Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) analysis for slowness estimation in the (f-k) domain and show that for the f-k domain broadband processing, group slowness estimates have more variance than the phase slowness estimates and time location estimates. In order to improve the group slowness estimates we exploit the time compactness property of the modes to effectively represent the data as a linear superposition of <b>time</b> compact <b>space</b> <b>time</b> propagators parameterized by the phase and group slowness. A linear least squares estimation algorithm in the <b>space</b> <b>time</b> domain is then used to obtain improved group slowness estimates.
