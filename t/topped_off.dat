5|$|Slangen, Tivoli Gardens's family roller coaster, {{closed on}} September 21, 2003 {{to make room}} for Dæmonen. Once the roller coaster was demolished, {{construction}} for the new roller coaster commenced. By the beginning of December, most of the brake run and station portions of the track were erected. By the new year, the lift hill was <b>topped</b> <b>off.</b> The first drop was completed by the end of January 2004 and the last piece of track was placed in February.|$|E
5|$|El Toro sits on {{the former}} site of Viper, which closed in 2004. Everything was removed in early 2005 except for the station. El Toro was {{announced}} on September 28, 2005 along with Bugs Bunny National Park, a new themed area for children. It was also announced El Toro {{would be part of}} a new themed area known as Plaza del Carnaval. The lift hill was <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> on December 20, 2005. The ride started testing on Memorial Day weekend in 2006. The ride had a surprise opening on June 11 then held its grand opening on June 12.|$|E

5|$|Notre Dame {{continued}} to succeed under Parseghian {{in the early}} 1970s. Led by senior quarterback Joe Theismann, the team {{finished second in the}} polls in 1970 and avenged its Cotton Bowl loss, defeating the Longhorns 24–11 in an upset. In 1973, Parseghian had a perfect season and won a second national championship, <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> by a 24–23 win over Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but Alabama had held the top spot in the national polls. Parseghian was named coach of the year after the season by Football News.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular interest is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Site {{preparation}} {{began in}} late 2003, when on September 1, 2003, Hercules, a wooden roller coaster that {{sat in the}} current location of Hydra the Revenge, was closed and demolished. On September 14, 2004, the $13 million Hydra the Revenge was announced. Construction began {{in the spring of}} 2004 and continued through the winter. Hydra the Revenge was <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> (highest piece of the lift hill) on August 20, 2004 and the entire track layout was completed on December 4, 2004. The first cars for the coaster arrived at Dorney Park on December 10, 2004 and the first ride with people on a train took place on March 24, 2005. The roller coaster officially opened to the public on May 7, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Determinate, or bush, types bear a full crop all at {{once and}} <b>top</b> <b>off</b> at a {{specific}} height; they are often good choices for container growing. Determinate types are preferred by commercial growers who wish to harvest a whole field at one time, or home growers interested in canning. Indeterminate cultivars develop into vines that never <b>top</b> <b>off</b> and continue producing until killed by frost. They are preferred by home growers who wish ripe fruit throughout the season. As an intermediate form, there are plants sometimes known as [...] "vigorous determinate" [...] or [...] "semi-determinate"; these <b>top</b> <b>off</b> like determinates but produce a second crop after the initial crop. Many, if not all, heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate.|$|R

5|$|Commerce Square {{was part}} of an office-building boom {{that took place in the}} late 1980s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the boom {{numerous}} skyscrapers were constructed in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City. The US$300 million development of Commerce Square was led by Robert F. Maguire III, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners of Los Angeles. To get his project moving, Maguire engaged the architectural firm IM Pei & Partners (now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) to design the complex. Using a design by a leading architectural firm as incentive, Maguire approached IBM, a company he had past associations with. By early November 1984, after negotiations with Maguire, IBM agreed to be a joint partner in the development. IBM also agreed to serve as the lead tenant for One Commerce Square, occupying about half the building as its headquarters for the Mid-Atlantic region. Commerce Square would be split between two buildings, One Commerce Square being built first, and the second tower, Two Commerce Square, being built later once a lead tenant was secured. Plans for Commerce Square were officially announced on November 16, 1984 at a press conference held by Maguire and IBM at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. The first phase of the project included One Commerce Square, retail and restaurant space, a plaza, and an underground parking garage. Construction began with the first phase on June 10, 1985. One Commerce Square was <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> with a ceremony on June 6, 1986, and the skyscraper officially opened on October 23, 1987.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E

50|$|Tomatoes {{are also}} {{classified}} as determinate or indeterminate. Determinate, or bush, types bear a full crop {{all at once}} and <b>top</b> <b>off</b> at a specific height; they are often good choices for container growing. Determinate types are preferred by commercial growers who wish to harvest a whole field at one time, or home growers interested in canning. Indeterminate varieties develop into vines that never <b>top</b> <b>off</b> and continue producing until killed by frost. They are preferred by home growers and local-market farmers who want ripe fruit throughout the season. As an intermediate form, there are plants sometimes known as vigorous determinate or semi-determinate; these <b>top</b> <b>off</b> like determinates, but produce a second crop after the initial crop. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate, although some determinate heirlooms exist.|$|R

25|$|The Church of the Holy Mother of God in Donja Kamenica in {{the western}} part of the Bulgarian Empire (in modern Serbia) is notable for its unusual {{architectural}} style.

25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> with dry riprap. Riprap protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E

25|$|The architects {{wanted the}} {{building}} to give Bloomington residents {{the feeling that the}} courthouse belonged to them. To encourage this feeling the entrances on all four sides of the building are identical, a way to welcome people from all directions. Wanting to balance the feeling of symmetry with a sense of power Reeves and Baile created an identical hierarchy in each facade through the use of an entrance arch, enhanced vertically by columns and <b>topped</b> <b>off</b> with a pediment. The exterior also makes use of many balustrades in the roof and other levels on the exterior. Also included are detailed egg-and-dart molding, and hood molding.|$|E
