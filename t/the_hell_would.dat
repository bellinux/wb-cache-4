5000|$|The term [...] "abominable fancy" [...] {{was first}} used by Frederic Farrar for the long-standing Christian idea that the eternal {{punishment}} of <b>the</b> damned in <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> entertain <b>the</b> saved. According to Philip C. Almond, this view was held by several early Christian philosophers, including Augustine, Tertullian, Thomas Aquinas and Peter Lombard.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Noel Hinners related the following: Rocco {{could be a}} tyrant in the formal meetings. On one {{occasion}} he demanded I tell him {{if it was a}} Phillips-head or a straight-head screw in box. I annoyingly responded, 'How <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> I know?' Years later I deduced that this was Rocco’s technique for getting you to the point where you’d best say, 'I don’t know,' rather than try to fake it and was part of his 'pay attention to detail' mentality.|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{a message}} from Thomas was {{allegedly}} posted to the Miami discussion board on scout.com. He claimed {{that he had been}} taken aside earlier in the year and told he needed to be [...] "more pro-UM" [...] as his criticism of the struggling team had been taken rather hard by the players. He dismissed concerns that he was serious when he said he wished he could have gone down on the field and joined in ("I'm 36 years old, what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> I have accomplished?") and said, [...] "If that was during my tenure we would have invited FIU to Tamiami Park to get it on."

5000|$|Whiteley's first Champion was Tom Rolfe, {{who gave}} him his first win Classic winner in 1965 when Ron Turcotte rode him to victory in the Preakness Stakes. In 1967, Whitelely had his second Champion in Damascus, who won two more Classics and was voted the 1967 Horse of the Year. Long reticent about talking to the media, {{leading up to the}} 1967 Kentucky Derby, Whiteley finally gave in as a result of all the hoopla {{surrounding}} Damascus. According to a New York Post newspaper article, [...] "The first question was 'How did Damascus sleep last night?' To which Whiteley replied, 'How <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> I know?

Her appeals failed, and she {{was transferred to the}} death row at San Quentin State Prison to await execution. On June 3, 1955, she was scheduled to be executed at 10:00 am, but that was stayed by California governor Goodwin J. Knight until 10:45 am. At 10:43 am, the execution was stayed by Knight again until 11:30 am, and a weary Graham protested, [...] "Why do they torture me? I was ready to go at ten o'clock." [...] At 11:28 am, Graham was led from her cell to be strapped in the gas chamber. There, she requested a blindfold so she would not {{have to look at the}} observers.

50|$|The story {{continues}} - {{after the}} hull is breached, Murphy {{gets out of}} the tank and orders Capelli into the tank to man the tank's gun, while Murphy goes to make sure the bomb is secure. Capelli, in the middle of combat, says he is needed out there and counters Murphy can engage the tank and so Alpha Team can bulldoze the bomb out the side. Murphy states they have to make sure it's defused before it drops, and because he {{is the only one who}} knows how to do it. Above the carnage, Murphy yells for Capelli to, for once in his life, stop questioning him and do something Murphy asks. Capelli, reluctantly, complies...only to notice Warner and Leavitt arrive in the tank as well. Leavitt says that Murphy told them to fall back to the tank. Capelli, naturally, asks why <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> he say that as, now, no one is covering him. Suddenly, Oppenheimer, now conscious and with a strange smile on his face, activates the tank's engines. Before Alpha Team can stop him, the tank falls out the side and off the ship.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1968, {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Behold & See which again was {{conceived as a}} concept piece. Prior to recording, more personnel changes took place with Jeff Baxter taking Winthrop's position, and DiDonato was replaced by Caryl Lee Britt. The album did not chart nearly as well, peaking at number 198. The publicity of the [...] "Bosstown Sound" [...] was quickly fading, as the marketing techniques were viewed unfavorably by critics and audiences alike. Another major weakness in the album {{was the lack of}} electric keyboards, a standout feature in their debut, and, without it, the group's complexity in the studio and live was hindered. The mimicking of the west coast sound, once seen as innovative, was then regarded as unappealing. Afterwards, Douglas exited and disbanded the group, leaving Hudson to continue on. Douglas, years later, looked back on the experience saying, [...] "...Lorber is totally arrogant in claiming that he has some special insight into how my songs were supposed to sound. How <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> he know? He never was interested in my vision of these songs. With all the grace and style of a bull in a china shop, he slapped those albums together - both the originals and the reissues - and marketed the hell out of them with no regard for artistic creativity or integrity, just maximum profit: his!". Lorber created a completely different lineup of Ultimate Spinach for their final album, which needed to be produced due to contractual obligations. In 1969, their final album, Ultimate Spinach III, was released, but failed to chart. After Douglas departed, the band did not have a primary songwriter so the album was misguided and contained multiple styles from each band member. The band broke up soon after.|$|E
50|$|The book {{hinges on}} Veppers' {{involvement}} in the War in Heaven. He initially {{appears to be a}} bit-player, but his involvement is gradually revealed to be more and more critical. The final revelation is that he has made some of his fortune by providing the hardware to run <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> of various species; over a century he has accumulated about 70% of all <b>the</b> <b>Hells.</b> <b>The</b> hardware is located on his country estate on the planet Sichult. He sets up a secret deal to have <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> destroyed in an attack which is to be blamed upon the Culture. His motivation is that such an attack will release him from his contracts to run <b>the</b> <b>Hells,</b> which <b>would</b> have become worthless if the anti-Hell side won, but which he cannot wriggle out of in any other way.|$|R
60|$|Her Majesty, {{getting worse}} every day, Pluto, in despair, {{determined}} to send for Æsculapius.

50|$|The Hungry Ghost Festival (Phor Tor) {{is celebrated}} {{on a grand}} scale by the Penang Chinese. The Chinese believe that on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, <b>the</b> gates of <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> open and that the dead souls would be free to roam amongst the living. The Chinese would placate the 'hungry ghosts' by burning incense, making food offerings and {{performing}} Chinese opera on makeshift stages.

5000|$|The girls wake up {{and ready}} {{themselves}} for another lesson in charm. So Hood complains about having Bubbles in her room, and Bubbles does not understand why So Hood feels that way. Farrah says at least they dont have Brittaney Starr in their room, because if they did they wouldnt be able to sleep. So Hood continues to bash Bubbles, saying theyre from Earth and shes from Mars. Bubbles tries {{to tell her that}} she never even talks to her, so it shouldnt be a problem. So Hood yells at her to shut up and to stop talking to her, and Bay Bay Bay runs in from the other room and immediately starts screaming in Bubbless face. Bubbles tries to defend herself, but So Hood, Bay Bay Bay, Ki Ki, Risky, and K.O. form a group and start screaming at Bubbles. Farrah states that [...] "Its ridiculous, theyre up in her face yelling at her. Who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> yell at Bubbles? She doesnt even know what youre talking about!

5000|$|Be seated.Men, {{all this}} stuff you hear about America not wanting to fight, wanting {{to stay out of}} the war, is a lot of bullshit. Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the {{champion}} marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.You are not all going to die. Only two percent of you right here today would be killed in a major battle. Every man is scared in his first action. If he says he's not, he's a goddamn liar. But the real hero is the man who fights even though he's scared. Some men will get over their fright in a minute under fire, some take an hour, and for some it takes days. But the real man never lets his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.All through your army career you men have bitched about what you call 'this chicken-shit drilling.' That is all for a purpose—to ensure instant obedience to orders and to create constant alertness. This must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck for a man who is not always on his toes. But the drilling has made veterans of all you men. You are ready! A man has to be alert all the time if he expects to keep on breathing. If not, some German son-of-a-bitch will sneak up behind him and beat him to death with a sock full of shit. There are four hundred neatly marked graves in Sicily, all because one man went to sleep on the job—but they are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before his officer did.An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, and fights as a team. This individual hero stuff is bullshit. The bilious bastards who write that stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real battle than they do about fucking. And we have the best team—we have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. Why, by God, I actually pity these poor bastards we're going up against.All the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters. Every single man in the army plays a vital role. So don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. What if every truck driver decided that he didn't like the whine of the shells and turned yellow and jumped headlong into a ditch? That cowardly bastard could say to himself, 'Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands.' What if every man said that? Where in <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>would</b> we be then? No, thank God, Americans don't say that. Every man does his job. Every man is important. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns, the quartermaster is needed to bring up the food and clothes for us because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last damn man in the mess hall, even the one who boils the water to keep us from getting the GI shits, has a job to do.Each man must think not only of himself, but think of his buddy fighting alongside him. We don't want yellow cowards in the army. They should be killed off like flies. If not, they will go back home after the war, goddamn cowards, and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the goddamn cowards and we'll have a nation of brave men.One of the bravest men I saw in the African campaign was on a telegraph pole in the midst of furious fire while we were moving toward Tunis. I stopped and asked him what the hell he was doing up there. He answered, 'Fixing the wire, sir.' 'Isn't it a little unhealthy up there right now?' I asked. 'Yes sir, but this goddamn wire has got to be fixed.' I asked, 'Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?' And he answered, 'No sir, but you sure as hell do.' Now, there was a real soldier. A real man. A man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how great the odds, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty appeared at the time.And you should have seen the trucks on the road to Gabès. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they crawled along those son-of-a-bitch roads, never stopping, never deviating from their course with shells bursting all around them. Many of the men drove over 40 consecutive hours. We got through on good old American guts. These were not combat men. But they were soldiers with a job to do. They were part of a team. Without them the fight would have been lost.Sure, we all want to go home. We want to get this war over with. But you can't win a war lying down. The quickest way to get it over with is to get the bastards who started it. We want to get the hell over there and clean the goddamn thing up, and then get at those purple-pissing Japs. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. So keep moving. And when we get to Berlin, I am personally going to shoot that paper-hanging son-of-a-bitch Hitler.When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a Boche will get him eventually. The hell with that. My men don't dig foxholes. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have or ever will have. We're not just going to shoot the bastards, we're going to rip out their living goddamned guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun cocksuckers by the bushel-fucking-basket.Some of you men are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you'll all do your duty. War is a bloody business, a killing business. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them, spill their blood or they will spill yours. Shoot them in the guts. Rip open their belly. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt from your face and you realize that it's not dirt, it's the blood and gut of what was once your best friend, you'll know what to do.I don't want any messages saying 'I'm holding my position.' We're not holding a goddamned thing. We're advancing constantly and we're not interested in holding anything except the enemy's balls. We're going to hold him by his balls and we're going to kick him in the ass; twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all the time. Our plan of operation is to advance and keep on advancing. We're going to go through the enemy like shit through a tinhorn.There will be some complaints that we're pushing our people too hard. I don't give a damn about such complaints. I believe that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder we push, the more Germans we kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing harder means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that. My men don't surrender. I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he is hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight. That's not just bullshit either. I want men like the lieutenant in Libya who, with a Luger against his chest, swept aside the gun with his hand, jerked his helmet off with the other and busted the hell out of the Boche with the helmet. Then he picked up the gun and he killed another German. All this time the man had a bullet through his lung. That's a man for you!Don't forget, you don't know I'm here at all. No word of that fact is to be mentioned in any letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell they did with me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this army. I'm not even supposed to be in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the goddamned Germans. Some day, I want them to rise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl 'Ach! It's the goddamned Third Army and that son-of-a-bitch Patton again!'Then there's one thing you men will be able to say when this war is over and you get back home. Thirty years from now when you're sitting by your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks, 'What did you do in the great World War Two?' You won't have to cough and say, 'Well, your granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana.' No sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say 'Son, your granddaddy rode with the great Third Army and a son-of-a-goddamned-bitch named George Patton!'All right, you sons of bitches. You know how I feel. I'll be proud to lead you wonderful guys in battle anytime, anywhere. That's all.|$|E

In a battle that put to the test, the promise that <b>the</b> gates of <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> not prevail.

On May 28, at Peabody's in Cleveland, OH, the new album was revealed to be titled <b>The</b> Age of <b>Hell</b> that was met with the debut live performance of the song [...] "Trigger Finger" [...] which will be included on the record. <b>The</b> Age Of <b>Hell</b> is a transitional album. The songs on it aren’t that bad, but the fire and the passion simply wasn’t there. It was more about holding on to something that was falling apart and recording those emotions. I think it’s still a decent metal album, but Crown Of Phantoms is really special to me, because of all the fire and passion. <b>The</b> Age Of <b>Hell</b> was basically me and Rob (Arnold) recording an album with a stand-in drummer. It isn’t a good representation of what we are all about. If fans had the chance to name an album which shouldn’t have the Chimaira mark on it, I’d suggest <b>The</b> Age Of <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> be <b>the</b> appropriate album. — Mark Hunter, on <b>The</b> Age of <b>Hell</b> and line-up changes ...|$|R
2500|$|Dante {{wakes up}} to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle {{contains}} the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, [...] "After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward." [...] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism ("the portal of the faith that you embrace") they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus ("a Mighty One") descend into Limbo and take Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as <b>the</b> Harrowing of <b>Hell,</b> <b>would</b> have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.|$|R
5000|$|Rick Rubin was {{recording}} the Cult in Studio A and {{we and the}} studio engineers stood in the airlock just outside the studio. A snatch of Highway to <b>Hell</b> <b>would</b> get played and then a snatch from Back in Black and then a snatch of Led Zeppelin, and we thought, What <b>the</b> <b>hells</b> going on there? [...] studio assistant said, Well, hes getting the guitar sounds from Back in Black, the drum sound from Highway to <b>Hell</b> and <b>the</b> voice sound from Led Zeppelin! Literally, as he was mixing he was getting a guitar sound on the Cult and then comparing it directly with the guitar sound {{that he wanted to}} get from Back in Black. The same with all the other instruments.|$|R
