At first it seemed they would marry; however, the Orthodox Church prohibited the marriage of first cousins, and Michael's father and Beatrice's mother were siblings. Nicholas refused <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> marriage and, to Michael's and Beatrice's mutual dismay, their romance ended.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 stones were moved from the site using a crane <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> archaeologists to excavate the area beneath them.|$|E
5|$|Some prey {{species are}} capable of {{fighting}} back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> prey to escape.|$|E

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

In 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> reserve's {{use as a}} public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E

At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E

The sale required approval from Count Pierre, who was overlord of both fiefs, but as consequence of the previous legal difficulties Carrouges had caused him, Pierre refused <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> sale and insisted that Carrouges turn the properties over to him in exchange for a full refund of the original price paid. Carrouges {{had no choice but to}} comply and subsequently blamed Jacques Le Gris' influence for this new misfortune.|$|E

Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU, {{which had}} been {{controlled}} by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.|$|E

Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone. Six months later Vizzini acquired the lease for the Miccichè estate.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed <b>to</b> <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> remaining buses to enter the compound.
