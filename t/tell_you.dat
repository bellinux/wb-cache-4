50|$|And so I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> as my {{superior}} {{about what}} I have found out. I am <b>telling</b> <b>you,</b> {{and you are}} wise and you should keep these words for yourself, so that no many people know, and you should take proper guard.|$|R

25|$|To {{some people}} the golden era of Hip Hop was ’94. Ask someone {{a little older}} and they’ll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> Hip Hop’s renaissance was back in ’88. Ask one of our revered pioneers and they’ll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the golden era came and went three decades ago, before most of today’s Hip Hop heads were born. Whatever the case these {{so-called}} golden eras weren’t only defined by the music or the fashion - they were characterised by something less tangible - an atmosphere, a movement.|$|E
50|$|Well, {{if you are}} a high-priced man, {{you will}} do exactly as this man <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, from morning till night. When he <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to pick up a pig and walk, you pick it up and you walk, and when he <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to sit down and rest, you sit down. You do that right {{straight}} through the day. And what's more, no back talk. Now a high-priced man does just what he's told to do, and no back talk. Do you understand that? When this man <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to walk, you walk; when he <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to sit down, you sit down, and you don't talk back at him. Now you come on to work here to-morrow morning and I'll know before night whether you are really a high-priced man or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You wish {{to believe}} he {{committed}} the crime. You believe him capable of committing it. But your instinct <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> he did not commit it. It <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> more--shall I go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And it chanced so with me,' said Riderhood. 'But I don't mind <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> how. Why should I mind <b>telling</b> <b>you?</b> I'm a Deputy Lock-keeper up the river, and I was {{off duty}} yes'day, and I shall be on to-morrow.' ...|$|R
25|$|SESSIONS: Well, I guess I'm {{concerned}} about your recollection, really, because it's {{not that long}} ago. It was an important issue. And that's troubling to me, I've got to <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

25|$|I {{wanted to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something… and I think it's {{affected}} my whole life, and I don't know if I {{can tell it}} very well, but I've thought {{about it a lot}} of times.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because you'll {{have to know}} a {{good many}} things that it <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> For one thing, it <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{the stage of the}} river--tells you whether there's more water or less in the river along here than there was last trip.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> Francis," [...] he said, as Gascoyne and {{he talked}} over the matter one day--"I <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> I will never serve them. Prithee, what shame can be fouler than to do such menial service, saving for one's {{rightful}} Lord?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Gudruda," [...] said Eric, [...] "did I not <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> of {{the magic}} arts of Swanhild? Did I not <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> before all men yonder in the hall, and didst thou not say that thou didst believe my words? Speak." ...|$|R
25|$|We can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who we are. Or {{where we}} live. It's too risky, and we've {{got to be}} careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they find us... well, we just won't let them find us..|$|E
25|$|I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that in Mauritania, {{freedom is}} total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
25|$|Lodge: I do {{not feel}} well enough {{informed}} {{to be able to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I have heard the shooting, but am not acquainted with all the facts. Also it is 4:30 A.M. in Washington and the US government cannot possibly have a view.|$|E

30|$|The legal model <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{to wait to}} ask for consent {{until the}} {{individual}} {{has a chance to}} make an informed choice based on alternative proposals for intervention. The research model <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to ask for permission to gather information, to follow the fair processing principles and to keep the data safe. The administrative model <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to use anonymised aggregated data and follow strict legal procedures when dealing with personal information. Most importantly, the pedagogical model <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to support the student’s own learning and use every opportunity to enhance the learning experience by bringing in relevant tasks and material. Data for learning analytics is as such an opportunity to enhance students’ data literacy.|$|R

25|$|Another major {{limitation}} {{with only}} using ctDNA levels to detect tumor burden is that ctDNA can only predict residual tumor, it cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> where the tumor or tumors are {{located within the}} body. This means that ctDNA will be best used complementary to imaging for disease burden at this time.|$|E

60|$|This, Giotto <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{to believe}} as the {{beginning}} of all knowledge and all power. [Footnote: So also the Master-builder of the Ducal Palace of Venice.

500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so that you could all be surprised. But I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
