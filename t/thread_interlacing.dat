Staged on November 27 th, here was the second general election under an amended constitution intended {{to bring about a}} more democratic system of parliament and government. Woven together are interrelated factors which field researchers like us – academics who craft their written studies on encounters, observations, and conversations gathered from a specific people and place – experience and live through in day-to-day work. Highlighted in this paper are our reflections and recollections as Richard, a journalism academic, and Teena, an anthropologist, researching in the field while fielding a political climate of ordinary folks’ frustration. By this, Tongan people saw the nineteenth century class-system instituted in the 1875 constitution was fixed to the modified political structure introduced in 2010. Therefore, the <b>thread</b> <b>interlacing</b> our journal excerpts to an analysis of what is taking hold in Tongan political life is satire and wit, and how humour is manoeuvred to criticise and critique power and authority...|$|E

This is unlike weaving or many forms of braiding where cloth is formed by <b>threads</b> <b>interlacing</b> in an over-under sequence. Pattern is formed by cord color, and splitting order.|$|R

He was {{in a world of}} three people, a minute human world that nevertheless filled his brain with eager speculations and schemes and cunning ideas. What were they thinking of? What did they think of him? What did they mean to do? A hundred busy <b>threads</b> <b>interlaced</b> in his mind as he pottered studiously over the Asiatic aeroplane. New ideas came up like bubbles in soda water.|$|R
40|$|A {{woven fabric}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} mutual <b>threads</b> <b>interlacing</b> in the fabric {{as well as the}} basic parameters of the fabric. The interrelation among fabric parameters can be obtained by considering a geometrical model of the fabric and specific experimental methods. The geometrical model is mainly concerned with the shape taken up by the yarn in the warp or weft cross-section of the fabric. This article provides a possible methodology for evaluation of geometric parameters of threads in the real longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of fabric. From an individual cross-section of the fabric using image analysis it is possible to define the diameter of threads, their deformation, thread spacing, the maximum displace-ment (height of binding wave) of the thread axis, the angle of the <b>thread</b> axis (<b>interlacing</b> angle), the length of the thread axis in the cross-section of the fabric, the crimp of threads in the fabric, and the real shape of the binding wave through wave coordinates. The pa-rameters mentioned are possible to use as input for mathematical modelling of the fabric structure and for prediction of mechanical and end-use properties of fabrics. Key words: fabric geometry, interlacing, cross-section, waviness, height, binding waves...|$|R

The next group of weft threads goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|Tapestry {{is a form}} of textile art. One of {{its basic}} {{characteristics}} is that it is woven, rather than embroidered. Weaving has a direction—that is, you begin at one point and proceed, by <b>interlacing</b> <b>threads,</b> to another point. You do not range over the surface, as a painter might while working on a canvas.|$|R

To make Kevlar cloth, the Kevlar yarns are woven in the {{simplest}} pattern, plain or tabby weave. which is merely the over & under pattern of <b>threads</b> that <b>interlace</b> alternatively.2. Unlike Kevlar, the Spectra used in bulletproof vests is usually not woven. instead the strong polyethelene polymer filaments are spun into fibers that are then laid parallel to each other. Resin is used to coat the fibers, sealing them {{together to form a}} sheet of Spectra cloth. Two sheets of cloth are then placed at right angles to one another and again bonded, forming a nonwoven fabric that is next sandwiched between two sheets of polyethelene film. The vest shape can then be cut from the material.|$|R
5000|$|Weaving is {{a method}} of textile {{production}} in which two distinct sets of yarns or <b>threads</b> are <b>interlaced</b> {{at right angles to}} form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft or filling. (Weft or woof is an old English word meaning [...] "that which is woven".) The method in which these threads are inter-woven affects the characteristics of the cloth.Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds the warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band which meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back-strap, or other techniques without looms.|$|R

Its name is Solenostoma (I regret that no more popular title exists), and it has a pouch, formed in this case by a pair of long broad fins, within which the eggs are attached by <b>interlacing</b> <b>threads</b> that push out from the body. Probably in this instance nutriment is actually provided through these threads {{for the use of the}} embryo, in which case we must regard the mechanism as very closely analogous indeed to that which obtains among mammals.|$|R

Before the end of the eighteenth century, man did not exist-any more than the potency of life, the fecundity of labour, or the historical density of language. He is a quite recent creature, which the demiurge of knowledge fabricated with its own hands less than two hundred years ago: but he has grown old so quickly that it has been only too easy to imagine that he had been waiting for thousands of years in the darkness for that moment of illumination in which he would finally be known.|$|R

A current phenomenon in higher education is the ever-expanding numbers of adults pursuing Post BA instruction. The present study considered the phenomenon of re-matriculation within the narrow framework of the studio arts, identifying <b>threads</b> of art-making <b>interlaced</b> with mid-life identity themes. The resulting collage of individual reflections on self and art sheds light on a shared essence of the human condition related to tapping into the aesthetic core in the adult years, a timeframe traditionally associated with application of skills rather than schooling. The contemporary issue raised here focused on several components, namely that these re-matriculating adults were still questing for a venue of self-expression and were interacting with a social frontier that among other things offered them a second opportunity to access institutions of higher learning with the purpose of exploring their creative gifts. From the rich tapestry of narratives came tales of self-reflection perhaps common to us all...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of purported nonclients to whom lawyers might have {{obligations}} are members of bargaining units represented by unions. Despite the much publicized decline of labor unions, they have almost 16. 4 million members. In addition, many workers are members of bargaining units represented by labor unions, but are not union members. The relationship of union lawyers to these millions of bargaining unit members, whether members of the union or not, is unclear. An examination of how this relationship influences and is influenced by labor law offers a fascinating case study of the synergy between the substantive law and the law and ethics of lawyering. The substantive labor law, which has legitimized representation of a union as an entity, both promotes collective action {{on the part of}} unions and protects the individual rights of bargaining unit members. The union 2 ̆ 7 s duty of fair representation calibrates these sometimes conflicting obligations. This case study suggests re-examination of the current practice of analyzing substantive law and legal ethics as separate and unconnected fields. The current practice is to view substantive law and legal ethics as intersecting circles, and to accept grudgingly that in the narrow area of intersection the substantive law and the law of lawyering are the same. A model more consistent with this case study would view substantive law and legal ethics as 2 ̆ 2 warp and woof, 2 ̆ 2 as <b>interlaced</b> <b>threads</b> that together weave a whole tapestry...|$|R
6000|$|I {{find it very}} {{difficult}} to trace how form was added to form and interpretation followed interpretation in my ever-spreading, ever-deepening, ever-multiplying and enriching vision of this world into which I had been born. Every day added its impressions, its hints, its subtle explications to the growing understanding. Day after day the living <b>interlacing</b> <b>threads</b> of a mind weave together. Every morning now for three weeks and more (for to-day is Thursday and I started on a Tuesday) I have been trying to convey some idea of the factors and early influences by which my particular scrap of subjective tapestry was shaped, to show the child playing on the nursery floor, the son perplexed by his mother, gazing aghast at his dead father, exploring interminable suburbs, touched by first intimations of the sexual mystery, coming in with a sort of confused avidity towards the centres of the life of London. It is only by such an effort to write it down that one realises how marvellously crowded, how marvellously analytical and synthetic those ears must be. One begins with the little child to whom the sky is a roof of blue, the world a screen of opaque and disconnected facts, the home a thing eternal, and [...] "being good" [...] just simple obedience to unquestioned authority; and one comes at last to the vast world of one's adult perception, pierced deep by flaring searchlights of partial understanding, here masked by mists, here refracted and distorted through half translucent veils, here showing broad prospects and limitless vistas and here impenetrably dark.|$|R
40|$|Physics and {{mathematics}} {{are not usually}} perceived as being closely connected with textile and clothing design or construction, either by scientists or by artists. Those who make clothing from cloth, however, must always take into account two geometries: the plane geometry of the cloth and the solid geometry of the body. In order to clothe the body we begin with cloth. Woven, knitted, knotted, or otherwise constructed, the inherent structure of cloth reflects mathematical principles. <b>Interlaced</b> <b>threads</b> create square or triangular grids, techniques such as knitting or crocheting can make grids of any shape, from triangular to polyhedral. Those who make clothing transform flat fabric planes into three-dimensional forms {{through a variety of}} means. A single plane figure—such as a square, rectangle, or circle—can be used to create a garment without cutting or tailoring. Simple modifications are all that is required to fit a length of cloth around the body. The sari and the kilt, for example, use pleating, gathering, tucking, and tying to make the flat plane follow the contours of the three-dimensional body form. Cut and sewn clothing can also follow those principles. A single plane figure can become a garment through the medium of a single seam, as in the tubular sarong. Some designers have utilized these simple forms to great effect. Claire McCardell made an evening gown whose skirt is simply two rectangles seamed together, at the sides, and along the top edge for about one third of the way from each edge. The open portion is then gathered to the waistband, and the points are left to hang and drape in ripples at the side seams. Halston plated with the time-honored sarong effect in some of his designs, wrapping and tying a tube of supple silk charmeuse over the bust to create another striking evening dress. More interesting in terms of construction is the caftan he created by origami-like folding of a narrow textile length into an almost square robe, which still exploits the drape of the bias to mold the body...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines literary {{representations of}} the black female body in selected poetry by U. S. African American writer Audre Lorde and Afro-Brazilian writer Miriam Alves, focusing on how their literary projects construct and defy notions of black womanhood and black female sexualities in dialogue with national narratives and contexts. Within an historical, intersectional and transnational theoretical framework, this study analyses how the racial, gender and sexual politics of representation are articulated and negotiated {{within and outside the}} political and literary movements in the U. S. and Brazil in the 1970 s and 1980 s. As a theoretical framework, this research elaborates and uses the concept of “poli(poe) tics of embodiment”: a multi-layered artistic endeavor interwoven with the body politics Afro-diasporic women artists articulate and negotiate vis-à-vis the cultural, historical, and political communities in which they exist. A significant contribution of this study to the field of Afro-diasporic literary studies is, therefore, to historicize black women’s writings, examining their politics/poetics as <b>interlaced</b> <b>threads</b> of their literary production, as well as the writers’ trajectories as artists, intellectuals, and activists. In addition, this research aims at unraveling the socio-historical implications of Lorde’s and Alves’ literary representations in re-configuring essentialist, nationalist, and heteronormative perceptions of the black female body. The close reading of their poetry – supported by a discussion of their theoretical work, archival research, and interviews – pays attention to three dimensions of these artists’ poetic (re) constructions of the black female body: first, the black female “self” in re-imagined configurations against histories of fragmentation and violation; second, alternative iconographies of the black female sexuality against discourses of sexual/racial manipulation; and finally, the black female body as historical agent moving against narratives of objectification. This analysis suggests that Lorde’s and Alves’ writings promote multiple and polyphonic {{representations of the}} black female body within a historical continuum of black women artistic production across the diasporic space in the Americas...|$|R
