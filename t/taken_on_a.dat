5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{tour of the}} ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion {{that the possibility of}} the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{structure}} of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it had <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne.|$|E

5|$|Referred {{to as the}} {{cultural}} capital of Karnataka, Mysore {{is well known for}} the festivities that take place during the period of Dasara, the state festival of Karnataka. The Dasara festivities, which are celebrated over a ten-day period, were first introduced by King Raja Wodeyar I in 1610. On the ninth day of Dasara, called Mahanavami, the royal sword is worshipped and is <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> procession of decorated elephants, camels and horses. On the tenth day, called Vijayadashami, the traditional Dasara procession (locally known as Jumboo Savari) is held on the streets of Mysore which usually falls in the month of September or October.. the Idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari is placed on a golden mantapa {{on the back of a}} decorated elephant and <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> procession, accompanied by tabla, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels. The procession starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantapa, where the banni tree (Prosopis spicigera) is worshipped. The Dasara festivities culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with a torchlight parade, known locally as Panjina Kavayatthu.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|USS West Avenal (ID-3871) was a {{cargo ship}} in the United States Navy during World War I. She had been built as SS West Avenal for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{as part of the}} West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States. West Avenal was {{launched}} in October 1918 by the Western Pipe and Steel Company of San Francisco, California, and delivered to the US Navy when she was completed in February 1919. After she was commissioned and had <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> load of flour, West Avenal sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in early April.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire has <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> political dimension.|$|E

5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended to be complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she had <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. The battered ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states {{that the number of}} casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1920s, NFL {{membership}} {{had grown}} to 25 teams, and a rival league known as the American Football League was formed. The rival AFL folded after a single season, but it symbolized a growing interest in the professional game. Several college stars joined the NFL, most notably Red Grange from the University of Illinois, who was <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> famous barnstorming tour in 1925 by the Chicago Bears. Another scandal that season centered on a 1925 game between the Chicago Cardinals and the Milwaukee Badgers. The scandal involved a Chicago player, Art Folz, hiring a group of high school football players {{to play for the}} Milwaukee Badgers, against the Cardinals. This would ensure an inferior opponent for Chicago. The game was used to help prop up their win-loss percentage and as a chance of wrestling away the 1925 Championship away from the first place Pottsville Maroons. All parties were severely punished initially; however, a few months later the punishments were rescinded. Also that year a controversial dispute stripped the NFL title from the Maroons and awarded it to the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|During {{a school}} {{trip to a}} camp, a nude video of Anju is <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cell phone camera hidden in the bathroom.

With her mother's help, she hides his body in a compost pit that was originally made for manure. Unbeknownst to them, this is witnessed by Anu. Jyothi tells Rambabu about the incident and he devises a plan to save his family from imprisonment. He gets rid of the broken cell phone. However, as he is disposing of Varun's car, Rambabu is seen by a corrupt police constable named Veerabhadram, who holds a grudge against him. Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to Vizianagaram, where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and dine at a restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having <b>taken</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E
