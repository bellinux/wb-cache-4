5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E

5000|$|Some labor {{historians and}} {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} unfree laborby slaves, indentured servants, prisoners or other coerced personsis compatible with capitalist relations. Tom Brass argued that unfree labor is acceptable to capital. Historian Greg Grandin argues that capitalism has its origins in slavery: [...] "when historians <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Atlantic market revolution, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> capitalism. And when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> capitalism, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> slavery." [...] Historian Edward E. Baptist claims that slavery was an integral component in the violent development of American and global capitalism.|$|R

So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said we should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini {{was the first one}} who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman, and Benny Blanco, who also produced the song. Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got in a room, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how chicks talk too much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys talk too much," [...] "So, we had this war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes.

Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> at the time...

500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The first thing she decided on was to feature an orca, and have the story take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player would think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
500|$|To Freeman Dyson, {{one thing}} at least was clear: Sin'ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman {{understood}} what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> even {{if no one else}} did, but had not published anything. Moreover, he was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the Physical Review in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on [...] "A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics" [...] attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on [...] "The Theory of Positrons" [...] addressed the Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the [...] "Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction" [...] in 1950 and [...] "An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics" [...] in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the things}} that endeared him to his public was his comic use of {{language}} in his films; his characters (all of which were really variations of the main [...] "Cantinflas" [...] persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances) would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it {{to the point where}} no one understood what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money, was courting an attractive young woman, or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities, whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell. This manner of talking became known as Cantinflear, and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say [...] "¡estás cantinfleando!" [...] (loosely translated as you're pulling a [...] "Cantinflas!" [...] or you're [...] "Cantinflassing!") whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation. The Real Academia Española officially included the verb, cantinflear, cantinflas and cantinflada in its dictionary in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Monsalvat School for the Comparative Study of Religion", a {{progressive}} or liberal development seen against conservative religious experience, was established formally in 1896 {{as an institution}} hosted at Greenacre and the first director was Lewis Janes. Monsalvat was named after the sacred mountain in Wagner’s Parsifal where the Holy Grail was kept, though it is most often spelled Montsalvat. However, Farmer and Janes differed often - Janes wanted academic credentials among his speakers and a business-like plan for the economic solvency of the work by charging everyone rather than trusting on contributions. They had serious difficulty even agreeing on what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> - [...] "This difference of understanding could never have occurred between two men accustomed to business methods," [...] Janes wrote in 1899. Farmer framed the school as a place for encounter between religious leaders for [...] "a fuller realization" [...] of unity among religions, and relied on generosity and enthusiasm to overcome the challenges of economy. Nevertheless, the school and Greenacre continue to operate and was noted in newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|However, one film {{in which}} Orbison {{refused to allow}} his music to be used was Blue Velvet. Director David Lynch asked to use [...] "In Dreams", and Orbison {{initially}} declined Lynch's request. Lynch used it anyway. The song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by [...] Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the 'candy-colored clown' {{in relation to a}} dope deal... I thought, 'What in the world...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'." ...|$|E

Lu Ji was among the scholars. As their seating positions were determined by their ages, Lu Ji took the furthest seat because he was the youngest. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> using military force to bring about peace, Lu Ji raised his voice and said, [...] "In the past, when Guan Yiwu served as a chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, the Duke was able to unite the various lords under his control and bring order to the Empire without resorting to military force. Confucius once said, 'If remoter people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so.' Those who are present at this discussion speak of only using military force, and nothing about promoting civil culture and virtue. I, Ji, may be young and ignorant, but I don't feel at ease (after hearing what you've said)." [...] Zhang Zhao and the others were very surprised by Lu Ji's response.|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron {{was dropped}} by Arista Records in 1985 and quit recording, though he {{continued}} to tour. The same year he helped compose and sang [...] "Let Me See Your I.D." [...] on the Artists United Against Apartheid album Sun City, containing the famous line, [...] "The first time I heard there was trouble in the Middle East, I thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Pittsburgh". The song compares racial tensions in the U.S. with those in apartheid-era South Africa, implying that the U.S. was not too far ahead in race relations. In 1993, he signed to TVT Records and released Spirits, an album that included the seminal track [...] "'Message to the Messengers". The first track on the album criticized the rap artists of the day. Scott-Heron is known in many circles as [...] "the Godfather of rap" [...] and is widely considered {{to be one of}} the genre's founding fathers. Given the political consciousness that lies at the foundation of his work, he can also be called a founder of political rap. Message to the Messengers was a plea for the new generation of rappers to speak for change rather than perpetuate the current social situation, and to be more articulate and artistic. Regarding hip hop music in the 1990s, he said in an interview: ...|$|E

Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about...</b> So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation.

2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write {{and see if we}} could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
