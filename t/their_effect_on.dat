5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Hamersley Progress Association {{was formed to}} {{represent}} the views of Hamersley residents to all levels of government. It was, however, fairly short-lived.

It was renamed to Radio Interference Group – Hamersley Towers after it moved to complete community management, and lobbies the government and makes submissions to public inquiries on behalf of the community on the issue.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E
5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E

5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Jake in his diary.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by <b>their</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> normal {{versions of the}} protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
