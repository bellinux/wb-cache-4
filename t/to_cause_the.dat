5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> production of a shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, {{but it seems to}} play a role in the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{early on}} October18, Kiko was {{forecast}} to strike Mexico at tropical storm intensity and cyclone advisories were issued accordingly. However, a building mid-level ridge of high pressure over inland Mexico was then forecast <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> center of circulation to pass just offshore. Though no damage {{was reported in}} association with the cyclone, rough seas created by Kiko capsized a ship with thirty people on-board; two were found still alive, fifteen bodies were recovered, and nine were reported missing.|$|E

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War.

He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E

Unfortunately, the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E

The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage.

As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
