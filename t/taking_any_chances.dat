500|$|Kovalainen {{suffered}} a [...] on lap35. The McLaren limped {{around the track}} back to the pit lane on the disintegrating tyre, rejoining in 17th on a replacement. Alonso, Massa, Hamilton and Räikkönen all pitted for the final time over laps36 to 38. Coming out of {{the second round of}} pit stops, Hamilton led Räikkönen by 13seconds, Räikkönen more than 2.5seconds ahead of Massa. The gap between the Ferraris began to close, and Massa eased past Räikkönen on the back straight on lap49, to take second place on the track. Meanwhile, Kovalainen parked his car in the McLaren garage and retired from the race, his team not <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> with a problem which had developed with the engine's hydraulics.|$|E
500|$|As the 1937 season began, Feller {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the April 19, 1937 issue of Time magazine. In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. [...] "We're not <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> on that arm and we're not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka. On May 18 Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.|$|E

5000|$|Durkon Thundershield, a Lawful Good Dwarven Cleric, is {{the healer}} of the party. He {{had worked with}} Roy for {{years prior to the}} {{founding}} of the [...] "Order of the Stick." [...] Durkon travels through human lands on the orders of the high priest of Thor, who has exiled him {{as a result of a}} prophecy. In addition to his warhammer, shield, and heavy armor, he also employs divine magic granted by his patron god, Thor, such as calling down lightning or growing to many times his normal three-foot height. Durkon speaks and writes in a Scottish accent and has a fear of trees, <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> he can get to fight them. During a fight with vampire lizardman Malack, he is turned into a vampire, and his body is now occupied by an evil spirit that serves Hel, the Goddess of the Norse Underworld.|$|R
500|$|The New York Times writer Stephen Holden {{considered}} Bedtime Stories as [...] "easily Madonna's best album", {{and concluded}} {{that it was a}} [...] "seductive mixture of soft-focus hip-hop and bittersweet ballads". Peter Galvin from The Advocate magazine gave a positive review, describing the album as [...] "a gorgeously produced R album with lots of funky beats lush keyboards, and soaring Love Unlimited-style string arrangements". Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna's most low-key album and her best work at the date. J.D. Considine, while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun, declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener-friendly than Madonna's previous albums. He added that it [...] "seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer's first album, emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements", while praising Madonna's vocal performance. Linda L. Labin from the Bangor Daily News, noted that [...] " [...] isn't <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances.</b> This time around, her daring {{has more to do with}} music than lyrics", while also praising her vocals; [...] "If anything, her singing is the album's greatest strength. Madonna uses every trick from her repertoire. [...] Bedtime Stories turns in some of the strongest performances of her career. 'Madonna sings well' — bet you don't see that headline in the tabloids anytime soon". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two-stars-and-a-half out of four, writing that the album [...] "seems the least remarkable of all Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. [...] It has a nice, consistently relaxed feel, its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time".|$|E
2500|$|Convoy NK-686 {{started from}} New York with 28 cargo ships and tankers with PC-1264 {{as one of}} the convoy's five escort ships. While the war in Europe had officially ended the day before, the Commander of Eastern Sea Frontier was not <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> that {{individual}} German submarines might continue the battle. As the convoy headed south toward Key West, 15 ships joined when it passed the Chesapeake Bay, while others left it for the ports of Charleston, [...] Savannah and Jacksonville. Then, on 15 May, Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters was convinced the danger was over, and the merchantmen were dispersed to head for their destinations alone. The escort ships, Task Unit 02.9.10, were ordered to Key West for a week's training before returning to New York. On the return trip to Tompkinsville, New York, where Task Unit 02.9.10 arrived on 25 May, the crews' concern was where they were headed next, as there was still a war in the Pacific.|$|E

25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|R

Matters around the Castle are in far too {{disturbed}} a condition to allow the <b>taking</b> of <b>any</b> foolish <b>chances,</b> either in the way of being unarmed or of leaving the private entrance to the Castle open. I found my way through the rocky passage, and climbed by the Jacob's ladder fixed on the rock--a device of convenience in time of peace--to the foot of the flagstaff.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the defeat}} of the United Opposition, Stalin adopted more radical {{policies}} and came into conflict with the moderate wing of the party. The two factions maneuvered behind the scenes throughout 1928. In February-April 1929 the conflict came to a head and the moderates, branded the Right Opposition, or [...] "Rightists", were defeated and forced to [...] "admit their mistakes" [...] in November 1929. Rykov lost his position as Premier of the Russian SFSR to Sergei Syrtsov on 18 May 1929, but retained his other two posts. On 19 December 1930, after admitting another round of [...] "mistakes", he was replaced by Vyacheslav Molotov as both Soviet Premier and Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense. Two days later, Rykov was expelled from the Politburo, <b>taking</b> with him <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of political advancement.|$|R

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> individual stage.|$|R

60|$|His venture {{was far too}} serious, and {{the results}} of {{exposure}} too fraught with danger, to permit of his <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> with a disloyal fellow-conspirator. True, he had not even hinted at the enormity of the plot in which he was involving the old woman, but, as she had said, his stern commands for secrecy had told enough to arouse her suspicions, and with them her curiosity and cupidity. So it was that old Til might well have quailed in her tattered sandals had she but even vaguely guessed the thoughts which passed in De Vac's mind; but the extra gold pieces he dropped into her withered palm as she delivered the bundle to him, together with the promise of more, quite effectually won her loyalty and her silence for the time being.|$|E

They were not <b>taking</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances.</b> Johnny Chuck was not much afraid of Reddy Fox, for he had whipped him once, but {{he was afraid of}} old Granny Fox. Peter Rabbit was afraid of both. The nearer he got to the home of Reddy Fox, the more anxious and nervous he grew. You see, Reddy Fox had played so many tricks to try and catch Peter that Peter was not quite sure that this was not another trick. So he kept a sharp watch in every direction, ready to run at the least sign of danger.|$|E
