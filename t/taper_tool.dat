The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} that automatically generates interference-free tool path for five-axis flank milling of ruled surface. A boundary curve of the machined surface is subdivided into curve segments.

Geometric algorithms are proposed for calculating consecutive patches with G 1 continuity across the patch boundary. A <b>tapered</b> <b>tool</b> can move along the rulings of these patches without inducing local tool interference {{as a result of}} their developability. The machining deviation is controlled by the surface approximation error. A machining test is conducted with the generated CL data and the result verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.

The holes produced for the assembly is susceptible to cracks due to fatigue caused by tensile loads applied. These cracks can be prevented or its propagation can be prolonged by inducing compressive residual stress in the material around the hole. Cold expansion hole {{is one of the}} techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered mandrel/pin or ball into an undersized hole. A novel application of the cold expansion and surface modification of walls of the cylindrical hole is presented. Predrilled holes of different diameters in commercially available aluminum and Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy plates are cold expanded using a specially fabricated <b>tapered</b> <b>tool</b> that rotates and simultaneously traverses through the hole. The <b>tapered</b> <b>tool</b> expands the hole to the desired diameter and also stirs the internal wall of the hole. In order to understand the role of frictional heating and stirring in the cold expansion of holes three mediums, namely, dry (without cooling and lubricating), metal working fluid (cooling and lubricating) and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (lubricating and frictional heating) are used. The residual stress, surface roughness and hardness of the wall of the holes are measured and SEM images are captured. Significant residual stresses are induced in the material around the hole region. Significant hardness improvement with reasonable surface finish is obtained. Moreover the cold expanded holes showed considerable improvement in the fatigue life of the holes. The fatigue life is found to be directly proportional to residual stresses induced around the hole and inversely proportional to surface roughness. Hardness has a negative impact on fatigue life. The rotating tool cold expansion process is compared with conventional cold expansion process and good efficiency of cold expansion is achieved in case of Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy material using nanoparticles, in terms of fatigue life achieved. It is observed that frictional heating and the plastic deformation have combined effect on the performance of the cold expansion of cylindrical holes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: For {{achieving}} {{the goal of}} saving time on the tool grinding and design, an efficient method of developing the data management and searching system for the standard cutting tools is proposed in this study. Design/methodology/approach: At first the tool grinding software with open architecture was employed to design and plan grinding processes for seven types of tools. According to the characteristics of tools (e. g. types, diameter, radius and so on), 4802 tool data were established in the relational database. Then, the SQL syntax was utilized to write the searching algorithms, and the human machine interfaces of the searching system for the tool database were developed by C++ Builder. Findings: For grinding a square end mill with two-flute, a half {{of time on the}} tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of our system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the approach and retract time was improved up to 40 %, and an improvement of approximately 10. 6 % in the overall machining time can be achieved. Research limitations/implications: In fact, the used tool database in this study only includes some specific tools such as the square end mill. The step drill, <b>taper</b> <b>tools,</b> and special tools can also be taken into account in the database for future research. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and use tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. Some limitations on the tool design are undesirable for customers. On the contrary, employing not only the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools but the searching system combined with the grinding software, it gives more flexible for one to design new tools.

5000|$|<b>Tapered</b> shank <b>tools</b> {{are removed}} from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|R

The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the tapping part of thread milling cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the thread cutter designs made of solid carbide. There are solid and interlocking side milling cutters, which use a tapping part both as a single-disk and as a multi-disk one; chip flutes are made to be both as direct and as screw; solid designs of cutters are made from carbide with a diameter of up to 20 [...] . 25 mm; thread cutters can be left- and right-hand cutting; Designs of the combined thread mills are proposed; internal channels are used for coolant supply.
