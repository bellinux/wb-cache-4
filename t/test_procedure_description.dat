40|$|The purging {{operations}} for cryogenic main propulsion systems of upper stage are usually carried {{out for the}} following cases: 1) Purging of the Fill/Drain line after completion of propellant loading. This operation allows the removal of residual propellant mass; and 2) Purging of the Feed/Drain line if the mission is scrubbed. The lines would be purged by connections to a ground high-pressure gas storage source. The flowrate of purge gas should be regulated such that the pressure in the line will not exceed the required maximum allowable value. Exceeding the maximum allowable pressure may lead to structural damage in the line. To gain confidence in analytical models of the purge process, a test series was conducted. The test article, a 20 -cm incline line, was filled with liquid hydrogen and then purged with gaseous helium (GHe). The influences of GHe flowrates and initial temperatures were evaluated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{procedure}} is presented that {{was applied for}} wheelset components during {{the development of a}} light-weight wheel from Schwäbische Hüttenwerke (SHW). The procedure requires knowledge of the actual wheel forces that occur in service with respect to magnitude, frequency of occurence and also their correlation in time. These forces were determined for an inter-city train and were used to derive characteristic cumulative frequency of occurence distributions for a service life of 5 mill. kilometers. The data were also used to determine a load programm for prooftests regarding adequate service life in the existing test facility for wheelsets. Based on the above mentioned test-load program, fatigue strength tests can be carried out under typical and important loading conditions such as: straight run, concerning, passage over switches and sinusoidal running for all component-parts of the wheelset, i. e. wheel, hub, bolted connection, and the axle. Also described in the paper are the development of a light-weight wheel and the results of the tests that led to the optimally shaped and dimensioned wheel design. Achieved was a reduction of 30 % in weight compared with standard wheel as well as improved dynamic vehicle behaviour.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) {{will be able}} to meet some of its instrument astrometrics requirements. This paper describes a evaluation study that enables the validation of some requirements on vibration isolation solutions and active optical systems under dynamic conditions and with metrics that are representative of those expected on-orbit for SIM. The procedure involves interfacing the isolator under evaluation to the Micro-Precision Interferometer testbed (MPI) and measuring the requisite disturbance transfer functions in six degrees of freedom. These transfer functions accurately depict the effectiveness of the vibration isolation system and the active optics system at achieving nanome-ter stabilization of the optical elements. Modeled reaction wheel disturbance profiles are then played through this family of measurements to predict the on-orbit performance in terms of the desired metric; optical pathlength change and tip/tilt jitter of the instrument as a function of wheel speed. Applying different norms to these performance functions, the performance metric is simplified to a single number. Using the procedure, it is possible to simulate several operating modes of SIM. These modes include fringe tracking, internal path stabilization and pointing. Each operating mode can be tested under various isolator configurations: hard mounted (no isolation), active hexapod isolator and perfect isolator (noise floor). The paper describes the various operating configurations, summarizes the <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> presents a <b>description</b> of each isolator configuration and lists the corresponding results from the evaluation analysis...|$|R

Asymptotic, normality of the proposed test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously.

40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and in the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and to compare test results to research results from field tests.
