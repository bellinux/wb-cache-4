5|$|Due to {{high rates}} of {{desertion}} from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Problems rose soon {{already in}} the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and {{frequently}} clashed with King Thomas, seized a border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide his territory between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount to the defense of Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, {{served in}} the Sarajevo {{division}} of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated {{to keep the peace}} in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being indifferent as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> as aggressors and recommending against intervention.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} from Army Group F to Himmler, a {{decision}} was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Having {{taken as}} much Serbian land as he could, King Tvrtko turned his {{attention}} to the coast. The rapid economic growth of Bosnia, having begun during the reign of Tvrtko's uncle, continued unabated even during the political upheavels that followed Tvrtko's accession. The export of metal ores and metalwork (mainly silver, copper and lead) formed the backbone of the Bosnian economy. These goods were transported over the Dinaric Alps to the seashore, where they were bought chiefly by the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. The maritime cities of Ragusa and Kotor also depended on Tvrtko's realm for food, a dependency the king leveraged to increase the initially low and, for <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians,</b> disadvantageous prices. Yet, Bosnia could not make economic use of its share of the Adriatic coast, from the river Neretva to the Bay of Kotor, which lacked any major settlements. The three major cities in the area were all controlled by Hungary: Drijeva (which Tvrtko was forced to cede to Louis in 1357), Ragusa, and Kotor.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 {{where they}} were {{defeated}} by Bosnian forces in the Battle of Bileća and then was forced to retreat. After the fall of Serbia in 1389 Battle of Kosovo, where <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> participated through Vlatko Vuković, the Turks began various offensives against the Kingdom of Bosnia. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> defended themselves but without much success. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> resisted strongly in the Bosnian Royal castle of Jajce (the siege of Jajce), where the last Bosnian king Stjepan Tomašević tried to repel the Turks.

25|$|A {{crusade against}} Bosnia was preached again in 1337–38 and 1367, by popes Benedict XII and Urban V respectively, but in {{drastically}} different political circumstances. Hungary was {{ruled by a}} new dynasty, the Capetian Angevins, who supported the Kotromanić rulers of Bosnia. King Charles Robert once declared that any Hungarian who attacked Bosnia, ruled by his friend Stephen II, would {{be regarded as a}} traitor. The only significant impact the Bosnian Crusade had was augmenting the anti-Hungarian sentiment among <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians,</b> a major factor in Bosnian politics that contributed to the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463 and lasted beyond it.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the mujahideen}} funnelled arms and {{money into the}} country which Bosnia direly needed due to a United Nations-sanctioned arms embargo restricting the import of weapons into all of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, many of the mujahideen were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between the mujahideen and <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians.</b> Furthermore, some mujahideen wanted {{to fight a war}} of extermination, or use Bosnian territory as a base for terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Bosnia {{in the western}} Balkans during the Dark Ages is patchy. Upon the looter invasions by the Avars and Slavs from 6th-9th century, bringing Slavic languages, both probably gave way to feudalism only with the might by the Frankish penetrating into {{the region in the}} late 9th century (Bosnia probably originated as one such pre-feudal entity). It was also around this time that <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> were Christianized. Bosnia, due to its geographic position and terrain, {{was probably one of the}} last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast.|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} altered Bosnian history, as {{many residents}} adopted Islam, {{adding to the}} complex Bosnian ethno-religious identity. The Bosnian Church disappeared, although the circumstances of its decline has been debated as much as defining its nature and origins. Some historians contend that the Bosnian Krstjani converted en masse to Islam, seeking refuge from Catholic and Orthodox persecution. Others argue that the Bosnian Church had already ceased to operate many decades before the Turkish conquest. Whatever the case, a native and distinct Slavic Muslim community developed among <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> under Ottoman rule, quickly becoming dominant. By the early 1600s, approximately two-thirds of the Bosnian population was Muslim.|$|E
25|$|It is {{only from}} the 9th century that Frankish and Byzantine sources begin to mention early Slavic polities in the region. In this regard, the {{earliest}} widely acknowledged reference to Bosnia dates from the 10th century De Administrando Imperio written by Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, during which period Bosnia is briefly {{a part of the}} short-lived Serbian state of Časlav, after whose death in battle in about 960, much of Bosnia finds itself briefly incorporated into the Croatian state of Krešimir II. Shortly thereafter, in 997, Samuel of Bulgaria marches through Bosnia and asserts his over-lordship in parts of it, however, only to be defeated by the Byzantine Empire in 1018 which annexes Bulgaria and asserts its suzerainty in Bosnia. This lasted until later in the century when some parts of Bosnia are briefly incorporated into Croatia and others into Duklja from which the latter Bosnia appears to have seceded in about 1101, upon which Bosnia's bans tried to rule for themselves. However, they all too often found themselves in a tug-of-war between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. In the year of 1137, Hungary annexes most of Bosnia, then briefly losing her in 1167 to the Byzantine Empire before regaining her in 1180. Thus, prior to 1180 and the reign of Ban Kulin parts of Bosnia were briefly found in Serb or Croat units, but neither neighbor had held <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> long enough to acquire their loyalty or to impose any serious claim to Bosnia.|$|E

500|$|The {{staff of}} IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) {{headquarters}} left Hungary, and on 3 October 1944 {{they arrived in}} the village of Andrijaševci, near Vinkovci. The headquarters became partially operational on 7 October. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> did not leave Bácska immediately, and for a short period were garrisoned alongside Lombard's new 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. In the meantime, the Red Army continued to advance into Hungary, and on 9 October 1944 a telegram was sent by the commander of Waffen-SS forces in Hungary to IX SS Mountain Corps in Bosnia announcing that [...] "battle ready units from SS Oberführer Lombard's division and Bosnians from the Division Kama had been thrown into the fighting in Bacska". The Bosnian elements were deployed along the Tisza (...) river for a week or so as part of Kampfgruppe Syr in an attempt to slow the Soviet advance. As a result, the return of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> to the NDH was delayed.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of the Bosnian Muslim {{troops who}} {{had served in the}} Austro–Hungarian army, Himmler later said, [...] "I knew there was a chance that a few traitors might be smuggled into the division, but I haven't the {{slightest}} doubt concerning the loyalty of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians.</b> These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago, so why shouldn't they be so today." [...] Himmler awarded both Malkoč and Schweiger the Iron Cross Second Class for thwarting the mutiny. Five soldiers were also decorated.|$|E
500|$|On 10 September the {{division}} reached a strength of 126 officers, 374 non-commissioned officers and 3,293 men, composed of German officers and Bosnian Muslim soldiers, {{a fraction of}} its prescribed strength of 19,000 men. By this time, morale was waning within the new division just as it completed {{the final phase of}} its training in Hungary; the war was not going well, and there were rumours that the Germans were going to abandon the Balkans and leave the Muslims to defend themselves. Faced with high rates of desertion from the 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed a plan to disarm <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> in both divisions, and on 18 September travelled to see Himmler. The Reichsführer-SS instead opted for a plan to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division to the area of operations of the 13th SS Division in Bosnia and re-organise both divisions there. Combat arms units from the 13th SS Division were to be brought under the direct control of IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian), which would also move to Bosnia. Issued on 24 September, the plan cancelled the formation of the 23rd SS Division, and directed SS Oberführer (Senior Colonel) Gustav Lombard to form and command a new SS infantry division using the German cadre and equipment of the 23rd SS Division, supplemented by ethnic Germans recruited from Hungary. <b>The</b> <b>Bosnians</b> of the 23rd SS Division were to be transported by rail back to the Gradište-Županja-Bošnjaci area for re-organisation into a [...] "new" [...] Kama division.|$|E

500|$|In late April, {{members of}} the {{division}} took part in defending the Führerbunker in Berlin. On 5 May, the division's remaining men, both German and Bosnian, began to retreat eastwards towards Austria. On 8 May, an order was sent to retreat to Wolfsberg, Carinthia. On learning of the orders, unit imams of the 28th Regiment [...] "approached their commander, Hans Hanke and requested that they and their men be discharged and be allowed to attempt {{to return to their}} homeland... Soon, all of <b>the</b> <b>Bosnians</b> remaining in the division were asked if they wished to remain."

The rest crossed at Brčko covered by an intense artillery bombardment. Contact was immediately made with Partisan forces, who quickly withdrew into the forests. The service support units remained north of the Sava in Vinkovci, which became their permanent garrison area.
