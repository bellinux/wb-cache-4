5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that <b>there</b> <b>simply</b> were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{completion}} of the fort did have some drawbacks, however. The fort lacked some of the refinements that would be present at later forts like Fort Foote. In 1864, civil engineer William C. Gunnell requested {{the removal of the}} wooden buildings that served as company quarters at Fort Greble so that the ammunition for the fort could be safely placed in magazines to be built in place of the shanties. <b>There</b> <b>simply</b> had not been time in 1861 to construct proper earthen magazines. This sort of constant renovation and improvement would continue throughout the war as forts were adapted to new purposes and new garrisons.|$|E
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations.

25|$|In 1992, channel 38 {{began running}} CBS shows that were preempted by that network's then-affiliate WJBK-TV (channel 2).

Most of the stronger syndicated programs had been acquired by Fox affiliate WKBD-TV (channel 50; which, {{for all intents and}} purposes, was programmed as an independent as Fox did not carry a full week's worth of programming until 1993) and fellow independent station WXON (channel 20, now WMYD). <b>There</b> <b>simply</b> was not enough programming to go around, even for a market as large as Detroit.

[...] He would have to turn conservative Senators against it too, conservatives who were at the moment wholeheartedly for it—and not just Democratic conservatives but at least a few members of the Republican Old Guard." [...] President Eisenhower continued his opposition. In January, he claimed that the Bricker Amendment would fatally weaken the bargaining position of the United States because the states would be involved in foreign policy, recalling the divisions under the Articles of Confederation.|$|E

A thoroughly educated woman, who had attended teacher's college prior to her marriage to Ron's father, she was aptly suited to tutor her young son." [...] Christensen comments that this presentation of the exceptional qualities of his mother is typical of hagiographies– such as the Virgin Mary– and forms a kind of after-the-event rationalization, in which qualities assigned to the subject are also attributed to the subject's mother.

500|$|The public {{consultation}} process before the ruling, and the ruling itself were controversial, yielding 229 comments. ILUC {{was one of}} the most contentious issues.

[...] The New Fuels Alliance, representing more than two-dozen biofuel companies, researchers and investors, questioned the Board intention to include indirect land use change effects into account, wrote [...] "While it is likely true that zero is not the right number for the indirect effects of any product in the real world, enforcing indirect effects in a piecemeal way could have very serious consequences for the LCFS....

500|$|All of the {{interior}} scenes were shot at sound stages inside Kling Studios. Most of the exterior shots were filmed at Bronson Canyon, a set of caves at Griffith Park in Los Angeles that was a popular shooting location for low-budget films. The exterior scenes of the tracking station were shot at a television station on Mount Lee, {{not far from the}} Hollywood Sign. Varno said it was the first television station built in Los Angeles, but was only being used for emergency broadcasts when Blood Beast was filmed; it had also been used during World War II to send information and propaganda to the Allied Forces' overseas allies. Varno secured permission to film <b>there</b> <b>simply</b> by calling the city of Los Angeles and asking permission, something he said nobody else considered trying because they assumed the city would not allow it. Varno was familiar with the station because his father, Roland Varno, appeared in the first dramatic television show released in Los Angeles and it was transmitted from that station. For the Blood Beast shoot, Los Angeles charged a fee of $8 per actor to shoot at the station, but the crew could be any size. All shooting took place outside the station and none inside. Most of the station night scenes there were shot during the day, and the film crew often had to find shadows to shoot in or block out the sun to give the impression of nighttime. Gene Corman said of the shooting: [...] "That was one of the more mobile units I've ever been involved with. Normally, everybody chases the sun; we were chasing the shadows." ...|$|E
500|$|The first Boden professor, Horace Hayman Wilson, {{was elected}} in 1832 and died on 8 May 1860. The {{election}} for his successor {{came at a time}} of public debate about the nature of British missionary work in India, particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The East India Company, which controlled the British territories until they were absorbed into the British Empire in 1858, had had a general policy until 1813 of non-interference with Indian customs, including religion. Christian missionaries required a licence to proselytize. In practice, most could operate without a licence, except for Evangelicals, who were regarded as too radical in an age when Christians from other backgrounds were more prepared to be tolerant of other faiths. As the Evangelical movement grew in strength, it pressed for greater efforts to bring Christianity to India, and so the company relaxed its approach to missionaries in 1813. After 1858, the British government was reluctant to provoke further unrest by interference with local traditions and religion, but many of those charged with running India were themselves Evangelicals sympathetic to efforts to convert the country. As Beckerlegge has commented, [...] "the furtherance of Christian mission had become inextricably bound up with attempts to define Britain's role in India and indeed to justify Britain's presence in India." [...] The issue was whether Britain was <b>there</b> <b>simply</b> to govern India or to [...] "civilise" [...] it, and if the latter, whether to draw up or destroy India's existing culture and religion. Many of those who supported increased missionary work in India, says Beckerlegge, regarded the events of 1857 as [...] "nothing less than a divine judgment" [...] on Britain's failure to bring Christianity to the country.|$|E
500|$|In his December 1999 {{review for}} the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film {{a rating of}} three stars out of four. He {{described}} some of the animation, such as Firebird Suite, his favorite segment, as [...] "powerful" [...] though others, like the dance of the abstract triangles in Symphony No. 5, [...] "a little pedestrian". He admired Rhapsody in Blue and its interlocking stories, pointing out its style was reminiscent of the Madeline picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans. He thought Pines of Rome presented itself well in the IMAX format and found the Piano Concerto No. 2 played [...] "wonderfully as a self-contained film". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice to be [...] "not as visually sharp {{as the rest of}} the film". He nonetheless described the film on the whole as [...] "splendid entertainment". Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the film [...] "often has the feel of a giant corporate promotion whose stars are <b>there</b> <b>simply</b> to hawk the company's wares" [...] while noting the film [...] "is not especially innovative in its look or subject matter." [...] Firebird Suite was his favorite segment which left [...] "a lasting impression of the beauty, terror, and unpredictability of the natural world". He found The Sorcerer's Apprentice fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in Symphony No. 5 too abbreviated to amount to much. He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images [...] "quickly become redundant". He found Rhapsody in Blue to be the second-best in the film with its witty, hyper kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters. He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the tin soldier to be romantic. James Berardinelli found the film to be of uneven quality. He felt Symphony No. 5 was [...] "dull and uninspired", the yo-yoing flamingos [...] "wasteful", and the New York City-based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie. He found the story of the tin soldier to successfully mix its music with [...] "top-notch animation" [...] and [...] "an emotionally rewarding story". He felt the Firebird section was [...] "visually ingenious", and Pomp and Circumstance the most light-hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children, in an otherwise adult-oriented film. To him The Sorcerer's Apprentice was an enduring classic.|$|E
