5000|$|The Pit {{is known}} as one of the loudest venues in college basketball. During the 1998-99 season, the St. Petersburg Times {{conducted}} a study of decibel levels at collegiate basketball arenas. The Lobo game in The Pit against Arizona registered the loudest at 118 decibels, comparable to a <b>turbo-fan</b> <b>aircraft</b> at takeoff power. Noise levels up to 125 decibels have been measured, close to the pain threshold for the human ear. Basketball writer John Feinstein once likened the experience of a visiting team in The Pit to [...] "watching Roman gladiators emerging into a wall of sound." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ontario has few noise restrictions/abatement rules, {{unlike other}} Southern California {{airports}} such as John Wayne Airport, Bob Hope Airport, Long Beach Airport, and San Diego International Airport, which all have very strict policies. The airport {{is allowed to}} operate 24/7, but during the hours of 10 pm to 7 am all aircraft must arrive from the east on runway 26L or 26R and take-off to the east on runway 8R or 8L, depending on ATC instruction. This procedure is known as [...] "Contra-Flow" [...] operations and applies to turbo-jet or <b>turbo-fan</b> <b>aircraft.</b> This procedure {{is similar to the}} one employed by LAX, where all landings are conducted from the west and all takeoffs are to the west (known as [...] "over-ocean" [...] operations) between midnight and 6:30 a.m. Both of these procedures are employed as long as weather and/or construction activity permits. This is done in an effort to be better neighbors and minimize the noise impact to the surrounding communities as much as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Attendance at Lobo {{games in}} The Pit has {{consistently}} {{been among the}} national leaders in college basketball, averaging over 15,400 fans per game since it opened. The Lobos {{finished in the top}} five nationally in attendance sixteen times in their first twenty years at The Pit, reaching second five times, and they were in the top ten all but one season through 2002. The design of the arena makes it one of the loudest venues in college basketball, creating a hostile playing environment for visitors. A study of decibel levels at collegiate basketball arenas found that a game at The Pit registered as the loudest at 118 decibels, comparable to a <b>turbo-fan</b> <b>aircraft</b> at takeoff power. Noise levels up to 125 decibels have been measured, close to the pain threshold for the human ear. Contributing to the intimidating environment for visitors is the mile high elevation of The Pit, emphasized to visiting teams with a message along the wall of the tunnel from the locker rooms down to the playing floor saying, [...] "Welcome to the legendary Pit, a mile high and louder than..." ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Designing successful commercial aircraft is a difficult business; {{the stakes are high}} and the risks numerous. Researchers in the past have developed methods that assist the designers in reducing these risks. In recent years such methods have benefited from improvements in computer technology. The work described in this thesis extends these methods to the design of commuter aircraft. These aircraft are more sensitive to operational requirements than other types due in part to their high zero-fuel mass ratio. It is essential that, for such aircraft, the best information possible is available to the designers. The identification of the optimum aircraft configuration and mission characteristics constitutes a vital part of this knowledge. A review of literature, involving both modem computer-based and traditional search methods, has shown continuing interest in aircraft project design methods from the earliest times to the latest conference. The work presented in this thesis is seen to compliment this interest in computer methods and to apply these techniques to the relatively neglected area of commuter aircraft design. A survey of commuter operation and aircraft types revealed the often conflicting requirements and regulations which govern the design process in this area. Detailed statistical analysis on a collection of commuter aircraft showed no consistent data patterns, but did indicate the bouyant state of the market. Earlier research work on the design of twin-engined turbo-prop aircraft had provided some experience in the design of short-haul aircraft. The new work improves these methods and applies them to larger and faster turbo-fan commuter aircraft. Since the turbo-prop work, the optimiser developed at RAE (Farnborough) has been rewritten to work more efficiently and allow larger problems to be tackled. This new optimiser s linked to a new synthesis routine which simulates <b>turbo-fan</b> <b>aircraft</b> design. The synthesis program was calibrated against industrial design calculations and shown to give acceptably accuracte predictions. The resulting design program is fully described and computer listings are presented. To illustrate the use of the optimisation methods in the devleopment of a new aircraft, a series of industrially related design studies is presented. These studies range from the selection of the initial baseline configuration, through various parameters sensitivity investigations, to the evaluation of aircraft and engine stretch options. To demonstrate more general types of design study, a series of optimisations in which the engine size is variable was conducted. This provides the designer with a knowledge of the absolute (optimum) design surface and allows him to judge the 'penalties' inherent in his chosen configuration...|$|E
