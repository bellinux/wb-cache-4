Regarding both accusations, Cracker Barrel officials disputed the claims and stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> committed to fair treatment of its employees and customers.|$|E

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that {{he felt that the}} team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E

5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E

5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E

5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission of the exchange control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, to the point <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E

Peter Adkison explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>was</b> doing {{a disservice to the}} games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products.
