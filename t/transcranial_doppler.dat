5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on <b>transcranial</b> <b>doppler</b> despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To assess <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> and {{the effect}} of an {{intravenous}} ultrasonic contrast agent for detecting intracranial aneurysms in patients admitted with a subarachnoid haemorrhage METHODS— 203 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage were examined with the operator blind to the results of the admission CT and subsequent digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). In 98 cases patients were imaged using unenhanced <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler,</b> and in 105 cases, patients were imaged both using unenhanced and echo contrast enhanced (Levovist, Schering AG) <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler.</b>  RESULTS—DSA detected 168 intracranial aneurysms in 128 patients (24 patients had multiple lesions) and 75 patients had an aneurysm negative DSA. There was agreement between DSA and <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> in 87 intracranial aneurysms of which 20 were only detected after infusion of contrast agent. Without contrast infusion, <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> showed a sensitivity of 40 % and specificity of 91 %. A significant increase in detection was noted when using a contrast agent (χ 2 = 9. 49, p< 0. 001). With a contrast study the sensitivity increased to 55 % with a specificity of 83 %. Intracranial aneurysm detection by <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> was significantly dependent on position using a contrast infusion (χ 2 = 15. 87, p< 0. 05). A positive correlation was also found between the size of intracranial aneurysms measured by <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> and DSA (r= 0. 55, p< 0. 05). The <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> sensitivity and specificity increased with larger aneurysms and reached 100 % for intracranial aneurysms greater than 12 mm diameter. Detection by <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> was also dependent on morphology (χ 2 = 14. 46, p< 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—The detection of intracranial aneurysm by <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> is dependent on aneurysm location, size, and morphology and is enhanced with the use of an intravenous contrast agent. ...|$|R

The aims were to compare blood flow velocity during and between migraine attacks and to study asymmetries of the blood flow velocity. Compared with blood flow velocity values obtained in the attack-free interval, blood flow velocity was lower during attacks without aura in both common carotid arteries, but not in the other extra- and intracranial vessels which were examined. However, during attacks of migraine with aura, blood flow velocity tended to be lower in all examined vessels. There were no asymmetries of the blood flow velocity.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} whether combining non-invasive tests for intracranial aneurysms together would significantly improve aneurysm detection over individual tests.  METHODS— 114 patients undergoing intra-arterial {{digital subtraction angiography}} to confirm or exclude an intracranial aneurysm were also examined by CT angiography, MR angiography, and <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound. The reviewers and ultrasonographers were blinded to the angiogram result, other imaging results and all clinical information.  RESULTS—The combination of non-invasive tests did improve diagnostic performance on a per patient basis. The combination of power Doppler and CT angiography had the greatest sensitivity for aneurysm detection (0. 83; 05 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 66 - 0. 93) {{and the level of}} agreement for this strategy with the reference angiographic standard was excellent (κ 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 72 - 0. 95). The improvement in sensitivity of adding power Doppler to CT angiography was not significant (p= 0. 55) but the improvement in the level of agreement with the reference standard was substantial. However, even the most sensitive combination strategy performed poorly in the detection of small (3 - 5 mm) and very small (< 3 mm) aneurysms with a sensitivity of 0. 43 (95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 66) and 0. 00 (95 % CI 0. 00 - 0. 31) respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The addition of <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound to either CT angiography or MR angiography does improve diagnostic performance on a per patient basis but aneurysms of 5 mm or smaller can still not be reliably identified by current standard clinical non-invasive imaging modalities. ...|$|R

Patients and MethodsThe study was conducted as a screening study for 39 preterm neonates, their gestational age (GA) ranged between 26 and 35 weeks, and their birth weights (BW) ranged from 900 to 2500 g. They were considered clinically at risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to their prematurity and low birth weight. The study was focused on <b>transcranial</b> US <b>Doppler</b> examinations of cerebral vessels on the first two days of life while still no clinical evidence of ICH was detected. The routine US examination included searching for ICH, then Doppler examination was done and included measurement of peak-systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), mean velocity (MV) and Doppler indices; resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) in anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA). US and Doppler examinations were then repeated within 4 – 7 days for only 34 newborns as five newborns died before the time of follow up study, we searched for newborns who developed ICH and measured all these Doppler parameters again for all the remained 34 newborns and these results were correlated with clinical assessment. ResultsAll the 34 preterm newborns showed no ICH by transcranial US at the initial examination. On the follow up US-Doppler study, 16 of them (47 %) developed ICH and they are classified as hemorrhage group and 18 of them (53 %) did not develop ICH and they are classified as non-hemorrhage or control group. There was no statistically significant difference (P-value of > 0. 05) between the two groups as regards the GA, weight, mean value of PSV and MV in both Doppler examinations, and mean value of RI and PI in the initial Doppler examination, while there was statistically significant difference (P-value of 9. 2 cm/s and so offers a measurable screening predictor parameter, when clinical symptoms of hemorrhage may be still silent and so preventive and therapeutic actions could be useful...|$|R

MethodsCBFV of 70 healthy late-preterm and term newborns with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (UCH) reaching the threshold of phototherapy requirement was compared with 70 gestational- and postnatal age-matched controls without hyperbilirubinemia. Resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and vascular diameter were measured in internal carotid, vertebral and middle cerebral arteries by <b>transcranial</b> color <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound {{at the beginning of}} phototherapy, after 48 – 72 h of starting phototherapy and at 5 – 7 days after its stoppage.

A further increase in CBFV was noticed after 48 h of phototherapy. After 5 – 7 days of stoppage of phototherapy, though there was a significant reduction in CBFV in mild-to-moderate UCH (serum bilirubin ⩽ 25 mg/dL), in severe UCH (serum bilirubin > 25 mg/dL), CBFV remained increased.

We assessed the suitability of laser Doppler flow (LDF) signal measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for noninvasive dual monitoring of targeted IA cell delivery. Methods—Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in adult Wistar rats (n 25) followed by IA or intravenous (IV) injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide. Cell infusion was monitored in real time with <b>transcranial</b> laser <b>Doppler</b> flowmetry while cellular delivery was assessed with MRI in vivo (4. 7 T) and ex vivo (9. 4 T). Results—Successful delivery of magnetically labeled MSCs could be readily visualized with MRI after IA but not IV injection. IA stem cell injection during acute stroke resulted in a high variability of cerebral engraftment. The amount of LDF reduction during cell infusion (up to 80 %) was found to correlate well with the degree of intracerebral engraftment, with low LDF values being associated with significant morbidity.
