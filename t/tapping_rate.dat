5000|$|The <b>tapping</b> <b>rate</b> is a {{psychological}} test given {{to assess the}} integrity of the neuromuscular system and examine motor control. The finger tapping test has the advantage of being a relatively pure neurologically driven motor task because the inertial and intersegmental interactions are so small that biomechanical influences on movement are reduced. Finger tapping involves three important features: time, spatial amplitude, and frequency. Studies have reported that the average number of taps per 10-second interval can be used to distinguish between patients with mild traumatic brain injury and healthy controls, is slower in people one month after sustaining a mild traumatic brain injury, and in experienced boxers and soccer players who frequently [...] "headed" [...] the ball. The speed of finger tapping has also been found to be related to severity of initial traumatic brain injury, and can be used to help assess recovery from mild and moderate traumatic brain injuries.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{defining}} symptoms of ideomotor apraxia is {{the inability to}} pantomime tool use. As an example, if a normal individual were handed a comb and instructed to pretend to brush his hair, he would grasp the comb properly and pass it through his hair. If this were repeated in a patient with ideomotor apraxia, the patient may move the comb in big circles around his head, hold it upside-down, or perhaps try and brush his teeth with it. The error may also be temporal in nature, such as brushing exceedingly slowly. The other characteristic symptom of ideomotor apraxia is the inability to imitate hand gestures, meaningless or meaningful, on request; a meaningless hand gesture is something like having someone make a ninety-degree angle with his thumb and placing it under his nose, with {{his hand in the}} plane of his face. This gesture has no meaning attached to it. In contrast, a meaningful gesture is something like saluting or waving goodbye. An important distinction here is that all of the above refer to actions that are consciously and voluntarily initiated. That is to say that a person is specifically asked to either imitate what someone else is doing or is given verbal instructions, such as [...] "wave goodbye." [...] People suffering from ideomotor apraxia will know what they are supposed to do, e.g. they will know to wave goodbye and what their arm and hand should do to accomplish it, but will be unable to execute the motion correctly. This voluntary type of action is distinct from spontaneous actions. Ideomotor apraxia patients may still retain the ability to perform spontaneous motions; if someone they know leaves the room, for instance, {{they may be able to}} wave goodbye to that person, despite being unable to do so at request. The ability to perform this sort of spontaneous action is not always retained, however; some sufferers lose this capability, as well. The recognition of meaningful gestures, e.g. understanding what waving goodbye means when it is seen, seems to be unaffected by ideomotor apraxia. It has also been shown that ideomotor apraxia sufferers may have some deficits in general spontaneous movements. Apraxia patients appear to be unable to tap their fingers as quickly as a control group, with a lower maximum <b>tapping</b> <b>rate</b> correlated with more severe apraxia. It has also been demonstrated that apraxic patients are slower to point at a target light when they do not have sight of their hand as compared with healthy patients under the same conditions. The two groups did not differ when they could see their hands. The speed and accuracy of grasping objects also appears unaffected by ideomotor apraxia. Patients suffering from ideomotor apraxia appear to be much more reliant on visual input when conducting movements then nonapraxic individuals.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{function}} of synchronous oscillatory activity at beta band (15 - 30 Hz) frequencies within the basal ganglia is unclear. Here we sought {{support for the}} hypothesis that beta activity has a global function within the basal ganglia and is not {{directly involved in the}} coding of specific biomechanical parameters of movement. METHODS: We recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nuclei of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease during a synchronized tapping task at three different externally cued rates. RESULTS: Beta activity was suppressed during tapping, reaching a minimum that differed little across the different <b>tapping</b> <b>rates</b> despite an increase in velocity of finger movements. Thus beta power suppression was independent of specific motor parameters. Moreover, although beta oscillations remained suppressed during all <b>tapping</b> <b>rates,</b> periods of resynchronization between taps were markedly attenuated during high <b>rate</b> <b>tapping.</b> As such, a beta rebound above baseline between taps at the lower rates was absent at the high rate. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that beta desynchronization in the region of the subthalamic nucleus is independent of motor parameters and that the beta resynchronization is differentially modulated by <b>rate</b> of finger <b>tapping,</b> SIGNIFICANCE: These findings implicate consistent beta suppression in the facilitation of continuous movement sequences...|$|R

40|$|Impahwnts in {{repetitive}} finger tapping {{have not}} {{been found in the}} ipsilesional hand, possibly because the performance measure (<b>tapping</b> <b>rate)</b> which has been used is not syqiciently sensitive. In this study, tapping performance of patients with lateralized brain damage was exambred using more detailed measures reflecting intertap variability and the relative timing of each tap cycle. In concert with previ-ous fndings, neither the left- nor the right-hemisphere-damaged patients exhibited an impairment in <b>tapping</b> <b>rate.</b> An impairment in tapping variability was observed, however, but only for the left hemisphere group. It is argued that intertap variabili-ty may be particularly sensitive to left hemisphere damage as this measure reflects the demands for rather precise and consistent phasing or sequencing of muscle activation. Since left hemisphere damage often leads to deficits in making transi-tions between movements in a sequence, the consistent sequencing of agonist-antagonist muscle activations in tapping may be compromised. Future research directions to examine this hypothesis are discussed. Motor performance deficits following lateralized brain damage have been the focus of a number of investigations.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy subjects to synchronise finger tapping, produced by rhythmic wrist movements, with auditory signals of target frequencies (range 1 - 5 Hz) and to sustain such rhythms following sudden withdrawal of auditory cues was studied. Healthy subjects were able, {{in the presence of}} auditory cues, to duplicate target frequencies accurately over the range investigated both in terms of mean <b>tapping</b> <b>rate</b> and in regularity of tapping. PD patients were less accurate under these conditions and on average tended to tap too rapidly at the lower (1 - 3 Hz) target frequencies and too slowly at the highest (5 Hz) target frequency. In addition, the variability of their tapping rhythms was generally greater. Healthy subjects were able to sustain tapping rhythms well following suppression of auditory signals. By contrast, withdrawal of external timing cues resulted in marked impairment of the patients' rhythm generation. At lower frequency targets (1 - 3 Hz) patients' tapping rates increased over rates which were already elevated in the presence of external cues. Conversely, at higher target frequencies (4 - 5 Hz), the average <b>tapping</b> <b>rate</b> tended to decline further from previously depressed levels. The accuracy of almost all patients fell outside the normal range. Two patterns of tapping errors were found. The first was hastening of tapping which was most evident at intermediate target frequencies. The second was faltering which occurred mainly at the higher target frequencies. These forms of behaviour may result from inherent abnormalities of internal rhythm generation since they occurred both in the presence and absence of external timing signals. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that the basal ganglia have a role in the internal cueing of repetitive voluntary movements...|$|E

40|$|As an {{extension}} of previous studies (Urbanczyk, Angel, & Kennelly, 1988) examining the effects of unimanual finger tapping on lateralized cognitive tasks, lateral body orienting was added to an established dual task paradigm to generate differential hemispheric activation and shifts of attention. One hundred twenty university students retained sequences of digits or spatial locations for 20 seconds either alone or during finger tapping. By turning both head and eyes left or right, the hemisphere congruent with the sequences (LH for digits, RH for locations) or incongruent (vice versa) was activated.

Congruent orientation produced significantly higher positive correlations between digit and location tasks than incongruent orientation.

For females, congruent activation enhanced <b>tapping</b> <b>rates</b> and retention-tapping correlations. For males, activation affected neither of these. Discussed in light of neuroanatomical research, these results suggest that congruent attentional orienting may integrate regions of the less activated hemisphere into networks of the more activated hemisphere.

Recent technological improvements in the recording equipment allow the responses to be analysed extremely quickly, and permit modification of the task in the interest of greater clinical specificity. Here we illustrate its use with some pilot data from a group of manifest HD patients and age-matched controls. Even in this small cohort, differences in the responses are apparent that appear to relate to the severity of the disease as measured by conventional behavioural tests...|$|E

Despite substantial evidence of timing deficits in ADHD youth, only two studies have explicitly examined timing in ADHD adults, and only at the supra-second time-scale. Also, the neural substrates of these deficits are largely unknown for both youth and adults with ADHD. The present study examined sub-second sensorimotor timing and its neural substrates in ADHD adults. Methods—Using fMRI, we examined paced and unpaced finger tapping {{in a sample of}} 20 unmedicated adults with ADHD and 19 controls comparable on age, sex and estimated-IQ. The blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast response was used to estimate task-related neural activity. Results—Behavioral data showed no between-group differences in mean <b>tapping</b> <b>rates</b> but greater within-subject variability in tap-to-tap intervals for ADHD adults relative to controls. Importantly, ADHD adults had greater clock rather than motor variability, consistent with a central timing locus for the atypical movements. The imaging results demonstrated that, relative to controls, ADHD adults showed less activity in a number of regions associated with sensorimotor timing, including prefrontal and precentral gyri, basal ganglia, cerebellum, inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyri and insula. Conclusions—Our findings show that sub-second timing abnormalities in ADHD youth persist into adulthood and suggest that abnormalities in the temporal structure of behavior observed in ADHD adults result from atypical function of cortico-cerebellar and cortico-striatal timing systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} performance of a domestic water-cooled air-conditioner (WAC) using tube-in-tube helical heat exchanger for preheating of domestic hot water was carried out. The main aims are to identify the comprehensive energy performance (space cooling and hot water preheating) of the WAC and the optimum design of the helical heat exchanger taking into account the variation in <b>tap</b> water flow <b>rate.</b> A split-type WAC was set up for {{experimental study}} at different indoor and outdoor conditions. The cooling output, the amount of recovered heat, and the power consumption for different hot water flow rates were measured. The experimental results showed that the cooling coefficient of performance (COP) of the WAC improves with the inclusion of the heat recovery option by a minimum of 12. 3 %. This can be further improved to 20. 6 % by an increase in <b>tap</b> water flow <b>rate.</b> Same result was observed for the comprehensive COP of the WAC. The maximum achievable comprehensive COP was 4. 92 when the <b>tap</b> water flow <b>rate</b> was set at 7. 7 L/min. The overall heat transfer coefficient of the helical heat exchanger under various operating conditions were determined by Wilson plot. A mathematical model relating the over all heat transfer coefficient to the outer pipe diameter was established which provides a convenient way of optimising the design of the helical heat exchanger.
