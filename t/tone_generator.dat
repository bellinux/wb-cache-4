500|$|The E-100 {{series was}} a cost-reduced {{version of the}} A-100 {{introduced}} in 1965, with only one set of drawbars per manual, a reduced number of presets, and a slightly different <b>tone</b> <b>generator.</b> This {{was followed by the}} H-100 series, with a redesigned tonewheel generator and various other additional features. Unfortunately, the organ was not particularly well made, and suffered a reputation for being unreliable.

500|$|It was {{revealed}} in March 2013 in a Famitsu interview, that 66 tracks spanning across all three games (with {{a majority of}} them concentrated in Kingdom Hearts Final Mix) were re-recorded with live instrumentation, {{as opposed to the}} original games' use of the PlayStation 2's built-in <b>tone</b> <b>generator</b> for their background music. In June 2013, Nomura stated that the original game assets for Kingdom Hearts had been lost some time ago. He explained, [...] " [...] was lost, so we had to research, and we had to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy." [...] In July 2017, Nomura spoke on bringing the collection to the Xbox One, saying he did not believe there was much demand for it outside of North America, but felt it could be a possibility after Square Enix completed development on Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E

It was programmed using patch cords that connected nine operational amplifiers and other components. General Electric also marketed an [...] "educational" [...] analog computer kit of a simple design in the early 1960s consisting of a two transistor <b>tone</b> <b>generator</b> and three potentiometers wired such that the frequency of the oscillator was nulled when the potentiometer dials were positioned by hand to satisfy an equation. The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved. Multiplication or division could be performed depending on which dials were considered inputs and which was the output. Accuracy and resolution was limited and a simple slide rule was more accurate; however, the unit did demonstrate the basic principle.|$|E
