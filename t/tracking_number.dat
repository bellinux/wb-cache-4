50|$|Since freight sent via LTL {{carriers}} {{is subject}} to misrouting or misloading {{it is a good}} practice to put the <b>tracking</b> <b>number</b> on each side of each piece of freight. If the destination state and zipcode are affixed to each side as well, misloading is less likely to occur. Even though it is not required it is good practice to affix a relatively large label including four letter carrier code, <b>tracking</b> <b>number,</b> destination station, and destination zipcode of the shipment (i.e. ABFS123456789 GA 30301). The easier it is for dockworkers to identify an individual shipment the less likely it is to be put in the wrong place. The value or type of contents should not be advertised on the package to help reduce losses. If the only piece of identification is the <b>tracking</b> <b>number</b> the dockworker will have a harder time identifying the shipments pieces and as such the chances of freight being loaded onto the wrong trailer is greater thereby increasing the transit time and also increasing the chances of the shipment being lost. Proper labels, bar codes, and RFID are important for proper routing and delivery.|$|E

50|$|Whenever a {{vertical}} and a horizontal channel intersect, {{there is a}} switch box. In this architecture, when a wire enters a switch box, there are three programmable switches that allow it to connect to three other wires in adjacent channel segments. The pattern, or topology, of switches used in this architecture is the planar or domain-based switch box topology. In this switch box topology, a wire in <b>track</b> <b>number</b> one connects only to wires in <b>track</b> <b>number</b> one in adjacent channel segments, wires in <b>track</b> <b>number</b> 2 connect only to other wires in <b>track</b> <b>number</b> 2 and so on.
