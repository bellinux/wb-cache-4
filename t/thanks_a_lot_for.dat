I would particularly appreciate your assessment of the applicability of the theory to the non-Indian examples I have mentioned and your thoughts on different contemporary and historical examples that either support or contradict the model’s predictions.

40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to warmly thank Sébastien Ourselin. Back in 2007, he {{accepted}} me for doing a PhD in his lab (e-Health Research Centre, Brisbane, Australia) and {{gave me the opportunity}} to work on state-of-the-art topics like GPGPU programming for instance. He also thought that developing a fast shell-based finite element model for soft tissues would make a great PhD topic. And after the completion of my PhD, I must say that he was right. So <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> Seb <b>for</b> all your help and support during the 9 months we worked together and even beyond. Thank you as well for all the good wines you brought at each BBQ we did in Brisbane. And yes, Australians can be proud of their wine. Last but not least, thanks for not doing anything to compromise the success of my PhD once you were at UCL. I very much appreciated this and I will not forget it. Merci pour tout Seb. I would now like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Stéphane Cotin. I greatly appreciated to work with you during these three years.

40|$|The {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{previous}} parametric VaR models in estimating the market values during past few years has put their reliability in question. As a substitute, non-parametric and semi-parametric techniques were created, which are the subjects of this thesis. We study the Historical Simulation and Filtered Historical Simulation as two powerful alternatives to primary models in VaR measurement. In addition, we apply these methods to ten years data of the OMX index, to show how well they work.

First of all I want to thank Prof. Dr. Theo Wallimann. He agreed immediately when I asked him in December 1999 whether I could carry out my PhD in his lab. He was always present and gave good advice and help in both scientific and more “normal life ” questions. He always gave me the freedom to develop own ideas.

We need all the guns, tanks, radio parts, motors, etc. you can send us. The more we get, the fewer the lives that we will lose. We also need good business men and women back home and that’s what your job at Bryant is. Do the very best you can as fast as you can. We beat the Italians because we are smarter than they are.
