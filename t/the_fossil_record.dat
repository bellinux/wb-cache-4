5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> {{includes}} {{well documented}} examples of phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution. As such, much debate persists over {{the prominence of}} stasis in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> because <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best}} of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b> By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E

5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. <b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> {{of the greater}} noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|These are all corals and {{correspond}} to <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> time line. With readily-preserved hard calcareous skeletons, they comprise {{the majority of}} Anthozoan fossils.|$|E
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> it is unlikely that any particular form represented in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Eocene (about 42 mya), the miacids {{started to}} branch into two {{distinct}} {{groups of the}} order Carnivora: the Feliforms and Caniforms. The miacid precursors to the extant Feliforms remained forest-dwelling, arboreal or semi-arboreal ambush hunters, while the Caniform precursors were more mobile, opportunistic hunters. While {{it is clear that}} the first Feliforms appeared at this time, there is no clear common ancestor of the Feliform families in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>records.</b> As forest dwellers, the early Feliforms were subject to more rapid decomposition in the absence of sedimentary materials, resulting in large gaps in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>records.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E

5000|$|Archaeopteryx <b>fossils</b> from <b>the</b> {{quarries}} of Solnhofen limestone {{represent the}} most famous and well-known fossils from this area.

5|$|The {{differences}} between these forms are small and clinal, and the species could be possibly considered as monotypic. <b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> includes Pleistocene deposits from the UK and the Carpathian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary {{developmental biology}} in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, {{by showing that}} evolution could occur by heterochrony, {{such as in the}} retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> for nuthatches is sparse, and in Europe {{is limited}} to the extinct Sitta senogalliensis from the Lower Miocene in Italy and {{somewhat}} later material from France; the family appears to be of relatively recent origin.|$|E
