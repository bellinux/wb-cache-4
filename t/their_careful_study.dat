40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, film acting was {{emerging}} and finding its place among Western theatrical traditions. Throughout these years, dramatic acting occurred primarily in the legitimate theatre, on the Vaudeville stage, and in the frames of the silent cinema. Many dramatic theatre actors and comic Vaudeville performers crossed over to the medium of silent film and in doing so brought with them a history of theatrical conventions and dramatic acting styles. In Eloquent Gestures: The Transformation of Performance Style in the Griffith Biograph Films, Roberta Pearson and William Urrichio examine the films of D. W. Griffith that were produced between 1908 - 1913. From <b>their</b> <b>careful</b> <b>study</b> of Griffith’s body of work, the authors conclude that early silent film did in fact bring about significant changes in traditional dramatic performance techniques. These transformations were expressed and physicalized through the actor’s use of two distinct acting codes and styles: the realistic “verisimilar ” style and its predecessor, the nineteenth-century melodramatic “histrionic ” style. During this transitory period in the history of dramatic acting, the Thanhouser Studio produced and distributed a multitude of films and archived a substantial portion of each film’s descriptive narrative and critical reception.

40|$|For most {{functions}} of the heart its nerves {{are as important as}} its coronary arteries, but this is particularly true concerning cardiac rhythm, conduction and repolarization. It is thus paradoxical that postmortem correlative studies of sudden death virtually always include careful scrutiny of the coronary arteries but only rarely of the cardiac nerves or ganglia. In this review, abnormalities of the cardiac nerves and ganglia, collectively termed cardioneuropathies, are examined from the dual standpoint of their structural appearance and functional significance. Some cardioneuropathies are found {{in the absence of any}} other significant structural abnormality detectable in the heart and these are designated as pri- mary cardioneuropathies. A viral etiology or some heritable disorder must rank high among possible causes. Secondary cardioneuropathies are those observed in association with almost every disease that can affect the heart; examples include myocardial infarction, infections, amyloidosis and cancer, but there are many others. Because abnormalities of the heart's nerves and ganglia not only have their own unstabilizing influence on cardiac electrical activity but can also profoundly alter a patient's responses to pharmacologic treatment, it is hoped that future clinicopathologic examinations will more often include <b>their</b> <b>careful</b> <b>study</b> and thereby add to our meager knowledge about these important structures...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{consists of}} two parts: the second part was submitted earlier as a new proof of Nash's theorem, and the first part is a note explaining a problem found in that proof.

Abstract for the original paper: We give a novel proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in all finite games without using fixed point theorems or path following arguments. Our approach relies on a new notion intermediate between Nash and correlated equilibria called exchangeable equilibria, which are correlated equilibria with certain symmetry and factorization properties. We prove these exist by a duality argument, using Hart and Schmeidler's proof of correlated equilibrium existence as a first step. In an appropriate limit exchangeable equilibria converge to the convex hull of Nash equilibria, proving that these exist as well. Exchangeable equilibria are defined in terms of symmetries of the game, so this method automatically proves the stronger statement that a symmetric game has a symmetric Nash equilibrium. The case without symmetries follows by a symmetrization argument. Comment: Announcement of an error found in the original proof submitted 17 May 201...|$|E

40|$|Rapidly {{changing}} business environments is {{a challenge}} that most organizations of today are facing. It {{is often the case}} during times of economic difficulty that an organization enters a reactive move instead of attempting to reassess its strategic direction in order to meet new business requirements. It is the intent of this thesis to attempt to provide tools, which can be used to investigate organizations with a proven track record. The result of these tools will provide an organization in need of strategic change new options and, especially important, an eye-opener to new possibilities. Three organizations have been chosen that all have excelled in different strategic areas, making them world leaders in <b>their</b> industries. <b>Careful</b> <b>studies</b> of the strategies employed by these companies will be used to form something called Key Areas of Excellence. These areas of excellence form the backbone of this thesis as they explain the origins of successful strategies, which then can be applied to other organizations. To apply a new strategy within an organization it is necessary to know what capabilities currently exist, therefore a comparison is necessary to ascertain what kind of gaps that might exist. The last step involves the creation of a future corporate vision where the newfound strategies are incorporated within the case company. Steps are then made to explain how implementation should be handled and what risks are associated with these new strategies. If successful, the newly implemented strategies will give strength to the organization and allow it to function more effectively...|$|R

40|$|The myriad {{functions}} of lipids as signalling molecules {{is one of}} the most interesting fields in contemporary pharmacology, with a host of compounds recognized as mediators of communication within and between cells. The N-acyl conjugates of amino acids and neurotransmitters (NAANs) have recently come to prominence because of their potential roles in the nervous system, vasculature and the immune system. NAAN are compounds such as glycine, GABA or dopamine conjugated with long chain fatty acids. More than 70 endogenous NAAN have been reported although their physiological role remains uncertain, with various NAAN interacting with a low affinity at G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and ion channels. Regardless of their potential physiological function, NAAN are of great interest to pharmacologists because of their potential as flexible tools to probe new sites on GPCRs, transporters and ion channels. NAANs are amphipathic molecules, with a wide variety of potential fatty acid and headgroup moieties, a combination which provides a rich source of potential ligands engaging novel binding sites and mechanisms for modulation of membrane proteins such as GPCRs, ion channels and transporters. The unique actions of subsets of NAAN on voltage-gated calcium channels and glycine transporters indicate that the wide variety of NAAN may provide a readily exploitable resource for defining new pharmacological targets. Investigation of the physiological roles and pharmacological potential of these simple lipid conjugates is in its infancy, and we believe that there is much to be learnt from <b>their</b> <b>careful</b> <b>study.</b> 15 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (alloHSCT) is increasingly being used for treatment of hematologic malignancies, and the immunologic graft-versus-tumor effect (GVT) provides its therapeutic effectiveness. Disease relapse remains a cause of treatment failure in {{a significant proportion of}} patients undergoing alloHSCT without improvements over the last 2 - 3 decades. We summarize here current data and outline future research regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of relapse after alloHSCT. Although some factors (eg, disease status at alloHSCT or graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] effects) are common, other disease-specific factors may be unique. The impact of reduced-intensity regimens on relapse and survival still need to be assessed using contemporary supportive care and comparable patient populations. The outcome of patients relapsing after an alloHSCT generally remains poor even though interventions including donor leukocyte infusions can benefit some patients. Trials examining targeted therapies along with improved safety of alloHSCT may result in improved outcomes, yet selection bias necessitates prospective assessment to gauge the real contribution of any new therapies. Ongoing chronic GVHD (cGVHD) or other residual post-alloHSCT morbidities may limit the applicability of new therapies. Developing strategies to promptly identify patients as alloHSCT candidates, while malignancy is in a more treatable stage, could decrease relapses rates after alloHSCT. Better understanding and monitoring of minimal residual disease posttransplant could lead to novel preemptive treatments of relapse. Analyses of larger cohorts through multicenter collaborations or registries remain essential to probe questions not amenable to single center or prospective studies. Studies need to provide data with detail on disease status, prior treatments, biologic markers, and posttransplant events. Stringent statistical methods to study relapse remain an important area of research. The opportunities for improvement in prevention and management of post-alloHSCT relapse are apparent, but clinical discipline in <b>their</b> <b>careful</b> <b>study</b> remains important...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this note}} is to explain {{a problem with the}} proof of Nash’s theorem in [5], which is the main {{document}} attached below. We will use the notation of that paper through-out without further comment, with the exception that each document has its own section numbers and list of references. We are indebted to Sergiu Hart and Eran Shmaya for <b>their</b> <b>careful</b> <b>study</b> of [5] which led to their simultaneous discovery of this error. So far the error has not been fixed, but many of the results and techniques of the paper remain valid, so we will continue to make it available online. 1 The problem The error is in our proof of Lemma 4. 6, which is the main driver behind our assertion that order m exchangeable equilibria exist (Theorem 4. 7). Of course they do exist; this is the main benefit of setting out to prove something you already know to be true. To our knowledge everything before and after this step remains unaffected, but this is an important step {{in the middle of the}} proof and logically it must be patched if we are to reach the desired conclusion. The particular problem is our implicit use of the “fact ” below. In the incorrect proof of Lemma 4. 6 of [5], this “fact ” was applied with ΞmΓ in place of Γ and appropriate choices of σ ∈ ∆ΠG×Sm(ΞmΓ) and τ ∈ ∆ΠG×Sm(ΠmΓ). “Fact ” 1. Let σ, τ ∈ ∆Π(Γ) be two strategy profiles such that σi is payoff equivalent to τi in Γ for all i. Then σ and τ are payoff equivalent when viewed as strategies for the maximizer in the associated zero-sum game Γ 0. This may sound reasonable at first because it seems that the difference between payoff-equivalent strategies should not be game-theoretically significant. In fact it is false! And not just for odd counterexamples: it is false generically. Example 2. To see how this can fail, let Γ be the following symmetric bimatrix game: A = BT...|$|E
