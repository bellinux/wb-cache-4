30|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{non-uniform}} block HSV histogram algorithm is to divide <b>the</b> <b>image</b> into several blocks and then extract its color histogram for each block, {{so that the}} extracted color histogram can better represent the color distribution in <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> Because pixels in different regions have different contributions to <b>the</b> <b>image,</b> <b>the</b> block histogram algorithm here does not simply divide <b>the</b> <b>image</b> into several uniform blocks, but divide <b>the</b> <b>image</b> into blocks of different sizes. In an <b>image,</b> <b>the</b> pixels that reflect the content of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> are basically concentrated {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>image,</b> and <b>the</b> contribution of the pixels in the surrounding area to the content of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is slightly smaller.|$|R

The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
30|$|Because of {{the uneven}} {{illumination}} {{of the original}} remote sensing <b>image,</b> <b>the</b> background gray level of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is uneven.

30|$|When {{the color}} in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is rich and evenly distributed, the gray world method {{can be used}} to obtain an ideal {{correction}} result. However, for some specific scenes, such as the existence of a large area of a single color in <b>the</b> <b>image,</b> <b>the</b> premise of the gray world method assumption is no longer satisfied, and <b>the</b> corrected <b>image</b> will produce a significant color deviation. <b>The</b> richer <b>the</b> <b>image</b> color, <b>the</b> more accurate the color reproduction during calibration. According to the definition of entropy, image entropy {{can be used to}} measure <b>the</b> richness of <b>image</b> color. <b>The</b> richer <b>the</b> <b>image</b> color, <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>image</b> entropy; conversely, <b>the</b> less the color in <b>the</b> <b>image,</b> <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>image</b> entropy. Applying <b>the</b> physical meaning of <b>image</b> entropy to <b>the</b> algorithm, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is evenly segmented, the entropy values of different sub-blocks are different, and the weights are assigned according to the sub-block entropy value, thereby reducing the influence of a single-color block. Based on <b>the</b> <b>image</b> entropy theory, <b>the</b> gray world algorithm is improved, and the application range of the algorithm is expanded. First, the histogram equalization processing is performed on the R, G, and B channels of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> to improve <b>the</b> overall contrast. After the equalization process, the color cast of <b>the</b> color cast <b>image</b> has been weakened and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> contrast is deepened [13].|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>images</b> of Uttararama {{follow a}} {{different}} style from <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of the previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to {{a certain amount of}} dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of the Buddha.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, {{the proposed}} method aims to improve <b>the</b> <b>image</b> contrast, increase <b>the</b> <b>image</b> details, and reduce <b>the</b> <b>image</b> noise {{in comparison with}} ICM and UCM as these methods are the latest and most identical to <b>the</b> proposed method. <b>Image</b> contrast is evaluated trough the visual observation in section  4.1. Image details could be also partially evaluated through the observation of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> in section  4.1. In addition, to support the evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> details, <b>the</b> value of entropy is used. As mentioned {{at the beginning of}} section  4, high entropy value indicates that <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is more details and has more information whereas low entropy value shows that <b>the</b> <b>image</b> has less information. The entropy of an image is given by the equation (11). To evaluate <b>the</b> <b>image</b> noise, <b>the</b> values of MSE and PSNR are used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} <b>the</b> <b>image</b> {{compression}} problem is analyzed using genetic clustering algorithms {{based on the}} pixels of <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> <b>The</b> main problem to solve is to find an algorithm that performs the clustering efficiently. The possibility of solving clustering problems with genetic algorithms provides optimal solution. The present work makes use of genetic clustering algorithms to obtain an ordered representation of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> and then applies the DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transformation) to compress <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> <b>The</b> <b>image</b> quality is measured using PSNR measure. The genetic algorithm (GA) -based compression image has more PSNR value compared to <b>the</b> <b>image</b> without GA.
