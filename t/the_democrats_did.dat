5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not want to lower the tariff {{so much that they}} would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not pursue the matter.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider.

Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the fragmented primary opposition, McKinney won just enough votes to avoid a runoff. This all but assured her return to Congress after a two-year absence. However, contrary to traditional practice, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not restore McKinney's seniority. Had she been able to regain her seniority, she would have been a senior Democrat on the International Relations and Armed Services committees, as well as ranking Democrat on an International Relations subcommittee.|$|E

The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being. Hayes's strong stance against the Democratic attempts to repeal the election laws earned him the support of many in the North and boosted his unpopularity among many Republicans who had been alienated by his civil service reform efforts.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, {{the first}} {{cracks in the}} state Democratic Party began to show {{after the passage of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act by Congress. Bright and his faction, a {{majority}} of the party, began forcing out anti-slavery members of the party leadership, using support of the act as a litmus test of party loyalty. By then the national debate over the possible break-up of the Union had begun. The Whig party was also on the brink of collapse, and a new coalition party of former Whigs, former Democrats, the anti-immigration Free Soil party, and the anti-slavery Liberty Party came together. The result was the so-called Know-Nothing Party and the first real challenge to Democrat control of the state in a generation. The 1854 mid-term election caused the Democrats to lose seats in the Senate, but still maintain control. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did,</b> however, lose their majority in the house. The House was spilt with no party attaining majority, and the Whigs caucused with the Democrats to control the assembly. The effect was a virtual paralysis to the legislature, and Wright was unable to make any significant accomplishments during his last two years in office.|$|E
500|$|In August 2006, Rangel stated {{he would}} resign his seat if <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> {{not take the}} House that November, a {{statement}} that had real intent behind it, as at age 76 Rangel was feeling “the claustrophobia” of time.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> take control, and in January 2007, Rangel's {{long wait}} {{to head the}} Ways and Means Committee was over. [...] Not only was he the first African American to do so, {{but he was also}} the first New Yorker to chair the {{committee}} since Fernando Wood in the 1870s. [...] Now holder {{of one of the most}} powerful posts in all of Congress, he said the chairmanship “couldn’t have come any later for me.” [...] Age was not otherwise a factor with Rangel, who worked a scheduled 16 hours a day and looked a good deal younger than he was. Ebony magazine termed Rangel's ascent to the chairmanship [...] "a watershed moment for African-Americans, who historically have been shut out when it comes to deciding how to divvy up the trillions of dollars in the federal government's budget." [...] Rangel was able to establish an effective working relationship with ranking member Jim McCrery.|$|E
500|$|The {{elections}} of 1878 returned {{control of both}} houses of Congress to the Democrats {{for the first time}} since before the Civil War. [...] The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. [...] Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President. [...] Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. [...] Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>did</b> not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. [...] Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. [...] Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.|$|E
