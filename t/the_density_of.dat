5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being {{less than that of}} water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> matter was less than <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> {{individual}} particles {{varies with}} different eruptions. <b>The</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India).

Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E

40|$|Photographic {{observations}} of meteors {{carried out in}} Dushanbe by the method of instantaneous exposure have shown clearly that meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere are subjected to different types of fragmentation.

5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s.

These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering is determined by <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> electrons within the crystal.

5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced <b>the</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
