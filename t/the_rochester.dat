5|$|Just {{east of the}} river, {{the route}} passes north of the campus of <b>the</b> <b>Rochester</b> Institute of Technology, one of largest colleges in <b>the</b> <b>Rochester</b> area. NY252 connects to the college by way of Lomb Memorial Drive and Lowenthal Road before {{proceeding}} eastward into an area of Henrietta dominated by commercial establishments. From Brighton–Henrietta Town Line Road east to South Winton Road, NY252 is at least four lanes wide and is lined with plazas, stores and shopping centers. The approximate center of Henrietta's commercial district is situated near the modified diamond interchange that links NY252 to NY15. The Marketplace Mall and South Town Plaza, the two largest shopping centers in the area, are both located {{in the vicinity of}} this intersection. NY252 intersects NY15A and meets Interstate390 (I-390) at an interchange prior to intersecting Winton Road.|$|E

5|$|East of Brooks Avenue, NY33A {{passes through}} a small {{residential}} area before entering a more industrial neighborhood surrounding the Erie Canal and <b>the</b> <b>Rochester</b> city line. In the western portion of this area, the route meets I-390 at exit19 and intersects Buell Road (County Route162), which directly links NY33A to the airport a half-mile (0.8km) to the south. East of I-390, NY33A crosses the Erie Canal and enters the city of Rochester, at which point maintenance of NY33A shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the city of}} Rochester. On the northern bank of the waterway, the route passes under <b>the</b> <b>Rochester</b> and Southern Railroad. The surroundings become significantly more residential east of the railroad as the route heads northeastward toward downtown Rochester. However, NY33A ends roughly one mile (1.6km) west of downtown at a junction with NY33 (West Avenue). Here, Chili and West Avenues converge and NY33 continues toward downtown as West Main Street.|$|E
