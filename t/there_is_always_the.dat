5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> danger of straying {{too far from the}} real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E

Deep earthquake activity at Ciomadul occurs {{down to a}} depth of , indicating that the volcanic system between the magma chamber and lithospheric melts is still active. It {{is considered to be a}} potentially active volcano.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} money or {{materials}} in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. Market manipulation is possible on a large scale, particular examples being ramping and bear raids. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> risk of certain types of confidence tricks or other scams. The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This encourages a more even spread of players.|$|E
25|$|When using {{biomarkers}} as a {{proxy for}} reconstructing ancient environments, {{it is important to be}} aware of the biases inherent in the sedimentary record. Leaf matter incorporated into sediment is largely deposited during the autumn, so seasonal variations in leaf waxes must be considered accordingly. Furthermore, sediments average leaf waxes over lots of different plants in both space and time, making it difficult to calibrate the biological constraints on εl/w. Finally, preservation of biomolecules in the geologic record does not faithfully represent whole ecosystems, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> threat of hydrogen exchange, particularly if the sediments are subjected to high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} sports which are fairly {{dangerous}} and involve threatening activities, especially during competition. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> chance of athletes getting injured while competing or during training {{which is exactly}} the reason why a psychologist would eventually encounter a patient who is a serious athlete and {{is in need of}} their assistance to rehabilitate their PTSD. Psychology as a general occupation has dated back to times of 1878, and around 1897 the first psychologist specialising in sport was established, by the name of Dr. Norman Triplett. Ever since, sport psychologists were helping different athletes, in the mental aspect of their game, {{in order for them to}} reach their optimum potential.|$|E

25|$|There are {{advantages}} to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are {{very likely to}} have good biocompatibility and be easily degraded, because they are already present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes. In the production of naturally-derived materials {{there will also be}} batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled. Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption. Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, said farmer may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction {{is the use of}} forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes even more of a problem when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the buyer will not pay the amount required {{at the end of the}} contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires.|$|E
500|$|Among other {{commentators}} {{discussing the}} lyrical themes, Mark Hertsgaard writes that Harrison's [...] "response to the fleetingness of time was to affirm and celebrate life: 'make love {{all day long}} / make love singing songs'", while Robert Rodriguez describes [...] "Love You To" [...] as [...] "a somewhat oblique expression of love directed toward his bride, along with larger concerns regarding mortality and purpose". In Ian Inglis' estimation, the lyrics [...] "remind us that {{in a world of}} material dissatisfaction and moral disharmony, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> solace of sexual pleasure".|$|E

500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Eliade, {{modern man}} {{displays}} [...] "traces" [...] of [...] "mythological behavior" [...] because he intensely needs sacred {{time and the}} eternal return.

2500|$|For intuitionists, {{infinity}} {{is described}} as potential; terms synonymous with this notion are becoming or constructive.

[...] To access memory on the tape, a Turing machine moves a read head along it in finitely many steps: the tape is therefore only [...] "potentially" [...] infinite, since while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> ability to take another step, infinity itself is never actually reached.|$|E
