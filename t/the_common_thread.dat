25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} in Kunar Province {{during this time}} came from 22 identified groups, individual groups of which ranged in allegiance from those with tenuous ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda, to the majority that {{were little more than}} local criminals.

With the goal of successful elections in Kunar, military operations in the area focused primarily on the disruption of ACM activity, and these military operations utilized a number of different units and operational constructs to achieve this goal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the activists}} {{did not succeed}} in saving the theater, Fields {{captured}} their tumultuous efforts on film and this resulted in two films: Saving The Indian Hills and footage that later became the core of Preserve Me A Seat. The later film enlarges the focus of Saving The Indian Hills to the entire United States. It presents the story of the Indian Hills Theater Preservation Society, the Omaha group that formed to save the theater, in context with the companion stories of similar groups that formed in other cities with the intention of saving their own theater palaces from the wrecking ball. Because of the controversy surrounding its Indian Hills Theater elements, the film's premier faced long delays while litigation got resolved. The world premiere occurred in Grand Island, NE Nebraska. After the feature a lively panel discussion occurred featuring the film-makers and theater developer, Paul Warshauer. <b>The</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> of the theater preservation efforts within Preserve Me A Seat is their lack of success.|$|E

500|$|Rachel Carson {{was born}} on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, just up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. She was the {{daughter}} of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman. She {{spent a lot of time}} exploring around her family's [...] farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the St. Nicholas Magazine (which carried her first published stories), the works of Beatrix Potter, and the novels of Gene Stratton Porter, and in her teen years, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-five students.|$|E
500|$|Although Johnson {{is known}} for {{publishing}} Unitarian works, particularly those of Priestley, he also published the works of other Dissenters, Anglicans, and Jews. <b>The</b> <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> uniting his disparate religious publications was religious toleration. For example, he published the Reverend George Gregory's 1787 English translation of Bishop Robert Lowth's seminal book on Hebrew poetry, De Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum. Gregory published several other works with Johnson, such as Essays Historical and Moral (1785) and Sermons with Thoughts on the Composition and Delivery of a Sermon (1787). Gregory exemplified the type of author that Johnson preferred to work with: industrious and liberal-minded, but not bent on self-glorification. Yet, as Helen Braithwaite writes in her study of Johnson, his [...] "enlightened pluralistic approach was also seen by its opponents as inherently permissive, {{opening the door to}} all forms of unhealthy questioning and scepticism, and at odds with the stable virtues of established religion and authority".|$|E

2500|$|The core {{instrument}} in an inhalational anesthetic delivery system is an anesthetic machine.

[...] Since inhalational anaesthetics are flammable, various checklists {{have been developed to}} confirm that the machine is ready for use, that the safety features are active and the electrical hazards are removed.

2500|$|In the {{political}} vacuum created by this alienation, the southern {{wing of the}} Whig Party was formed.

[...] With both parties arguing who could best defend southern institutions, the nuances {{of the differences between}} free soil and abolitionism, which became an issue in the late 1840s with the Mexican War and territorial expansion, never became part of {{the political}} dialogue.
