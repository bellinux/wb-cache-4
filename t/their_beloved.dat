On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower {{held a press conference}} about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life.|$|E

5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to <b>their</b> <b>beloveds.</b> The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|R
40|$|Love is {{distinguished}} as {{a feeling that}} begins from the lover’s sight to the beloved. In societies in the past, lovers preferred to keep their relationships with the beloved in secret. It means that keeping love as a secret had been appropriate in societies. In present people’s view, {{it is a big}} problem which cannot be answered with any reason, but religion. Today’s lovers are not forced with such problem and they overtly speak about <b>their</b> <b>beloveds.</b> In Janette Oke’s fictions, the lovers openly speak about their idiosyncratic behaviors. She shows perfect love in her novels that is against egotism which this paper tries to survey it. 1...|$|R

Instead of the Theocritean emphasis on anxious or desperate lovers, who feel a sense of inferiority to <b>their</b> <b>beloveds</b> (especially clear is the case of the Cyclops of Theocr. 6 and 11), ps. -Theocr. 20 describes the rejection of love and the ex-beloved (a girl of the city) by a young shepherd who not only does not display any sense of inferiority for his less refined way of life and manners, but also expresses full pride for his job and life, and finds in this pride the way to avoid erotic despair...|$|R

25|$|In the Rhineland, May 1 is also {{celebrated by}} the {{delivery}} of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers {{to the house of}} a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice {{in the form of a}} heart at the house of <b>their</b> <b>beloved</b> one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the doormat. In leap years, it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual's choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they have no desire to leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are there to keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in <b>their</b> <b>beloved</b> village where, they believe, no harm can come to them.|$|E

Part of this praise is likely because the hemispherical heads on the original 2-valve engine allowed for an almost completely straight exhaust port, resulting in a less diluted or muddied engine sound, allowing Alfa Romeo to use quieter stock exhausts without losing much of <b>their</b> distinct and <b>beloved</b> race-bred engine noise.|$|R
25|$|While {{the stone}} {{sculpture}} {{and the inner}} sanctum image empowering the temple remained immovable, changing religious concepts during the period around the 10th century demanded that the deities {{take part in a}} variety of public roles similar to those of a human monarch. As a result, large bronze images were created to be carried outside the temple to participate in daily rituals, processions, and temple festivals. The round lugs and holes found on the bases of many of these sculptures are for the poles that were used to carry the heavy images. The deities in bronze who participated in such festivities were sumptuously clothed and decorated with precious jewellery. Their every need and comfort were catered to by a battery of temple priests, musicians, cooks, devadasis, administrators and patrons. The lay public thronged the processional route to have a darshan and admired <b>their</b> <b>beloved</b> deity for the lavish depiction of the figure and the grand costumes and jewelry.|$|E
25|$|Though the duo never stated so outright, their {{additional}} {{motivation in}} {{getting involved with}} KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, {{at least until the}} law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see <b>their</b> <b>beloved</b> club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continues to be involved with it in a lesser capacity.|$|E
25|$|By 1964, in {{the face}} of the superiority of tractors, the {{breeding}} of the heavy warmblood had completely collapsed. Stallions covered 10% of the mares that they had 20 years before. This scene played out in the 1950s and 60's throughout German horse breeding. During this time, though, increasing leisure time meant that horses soon found their modern cultural niche: recreational riding. The breeders of Ostfriesland aimed to develop their horses along this path, producing a lighter riding horse with all the economical traits that had made them popular before. Fearing that the Thoroughbred would detract from the amenable nature of their horses, the Ostfriesen breeders chose to use Arabian blood instead. Beginning in 1948, such stallions were made available to the breeders, who scarcely used them, being hard-put to change <b>their</b> <b>beloved</b> horses so drastically. However, the evidence was convincing, as the Freisen-Arabs were horses of excellent character, great capacity and riding quality. Unfortunately, they had missed the mark: the market demanded a light, elegant, but tall riding horses, and the Freisen-Arabs were smaller than their warmblood mothers. Limited in their competitiveness in dressage and jumping, the Freisen-Arabs did not sell, and the Ostfriesen horses seemed doomed to extinction.|$|E

In one of her Tiruvālaṅkāṭu verses, Kāraikkāl Ammaiyār describes those who bear the bier to the cremation ground as “agitated and unable to comprehend” (punti kalaṅki mati mayaṅki, 1.10), and yet in one of her Tiruvālaṅkāṭu signature verses she claims that she “thrives” at the burning ground (kāṭu malinta, 2.11).

40|$|The {{population}} ageing {{is inevitably}} {{going to change}} the society and the elderly living dynamics. Optimization of resources, independent living and enhancement of elderly’s social, working, and physical activities are the key aspects of this changing. The current paradigm is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), where the elderly person is enabled to live an independent and high-quality life by empowering the ambient around him/her. Home Automation can provide a two-way contribution: it represents an opportunity to help overcoming difficulties; while its pervasive instrumentation provides precious information. Being aware of the elderly's activities has several applications: for the families, reassuring them about <b>their</b> <b>beloved’s</b> safety, for the caregivers, enabling them to provide prompt interventions. To highlight this aspect, it is possible to refer to AAML: Ambient Assisted and Monitored Living. This chapter introduces the design procedure of AAML systems, and their main challenges: user's needs centrality, data visualization and dependability...|$|R

5000|$|The age-range when boys {{entered into}} such {{relationships}} was consonant {{with that of}} Greek girls given in marriage, often to adult husbands many years their senior. Boys, however, usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate, while marriages for girls were arranged for economic and political advantage {{at the discretion of}} father and suitor. These connections were also an advantage for a youth and his family, as the relationship with an influential older man resulted in an expanded social network. Thus, some considered it desirable to have had many admirers or mentors, if not necessarily lovers per se, in one’s younger years. Typically, after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married, the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life.
