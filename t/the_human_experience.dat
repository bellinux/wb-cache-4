5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Related to the {{argument}} from morality is {{the argument}} from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection beyond the realm of race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} {{and evaluation of}} art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby {{it is also an}} absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of different humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{microscopic}} {{kinetic energy}} {{portion of the}} internal energy {{gives rise to the}} temperature of the system.

Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy {{is often referred to as}} the thermal energy of a system, relating this energy, like the temperature, to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of hot and cold.|$|E
25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding {{of what it means to}} be human.|$|E

25|$|Wilder wrote Our Town, {{a popular}} play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was {{inspired}} by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of Americans, and many elements of Stein's modernist style {{can be found in}} the play. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set to underscore <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> Wilder played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
25|$|Norbert Wiener's {{book was}} {{the forerunner of}} studies in cybernetics, and has {{influenced}} many theorists. It has impacted the fields of computers and technology, engineering, biology, sociology, and {{a broad range of}} other sciences. Numerous books have been published in relation to cybernetics theory which explore alternative concepts and models of feedback, human/machine relationships, systems science, and industrial advancement. William Ross Ashby, another founder of cybernetics, wrote the book Introduction to Cybernetics, which presents many new interpretations and definitions. Other theorists have produced writings on systems, communication, and <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> in cybernetics. N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics, describes the effects of technology in the age of virtual information and what it means for humans to live in an ever-advancing society. The American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) is a research association founded in 1964, the same year Wiener died, and is dedicated to the cooperative understanding and further improvement of cybernetics theory.|$|E
25|$|However, the Industrial Revolution continued. Influential {{innovations}} included steam-powered industrialization, {{and especially}} the development of railways, starting in Britain in the 1830s, and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture associated with this. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was The Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate glass exhibition hall built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style {{in the construction of}} major railway terminals in London, such as Paddington Station (1854) and King's Cross station (1852). These technological advances led to the building of later structures like the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889). The latter broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. These engineering marvels radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people. <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of time itself was altered, with the development of the electric telegraph from 1837, and the adoption of standard time by British railway companies from 1845, and {{in the rest of the}} world over the next fifty years.|$|E

500|$|The Upanishads {{describe}} the universe, and <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience,</b> as an interplay of Purusha (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and Prakṛti (the temporary, changing material world, nature).

500|$|Blake {{based his}} {{portrayal}} of the apocalypse on his belief that God's love allowed for a personal apocalypse as part of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience.</b> In the notes to the work, he claimed that [...] "whenever any Individual Rejects Error & Embraces Truth a Last Judgement passes upon that Individual". This idea is connected to views of David Hartley of the [...] "pure disinterested love of God", and appears in other works by Blake, including his Jerusalem. Also, Blake's [...] describes the process that an individual goes through during an apocalypse, which includes having to confront their errors and their flaws. There is no peace during the struggle, as it involves a direct interaction between contrary views that would eventually establish the new state.|$|E

500|$|... "Here, There and Everywhere" [...] is a ballad that McCartney wrote {{towards the}} end of the Revolver sessions. His {{inspiration}} for the song was the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds track [...] "God Only Knows", which, in turn, Brian Wilson had been inspired to write after listening to Rubber Soul. McCartney's double-tracked vocal was treated with varispeeding, resulting in a higher pitch at playback. The song's opening lines are sung over shifts in time signature from 9/8 to 7/8 to 4/4; according to Everett, [...] "nowhere else does a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead." [...] Womack characterises the song as a romantic ballad [...] "about living in the here and now" [...] and [...] "fully experiencing the conscious moment".

500|$|... "Recuperative Winter" [...] {{reviews the}} {{cultural}} and social history of winter festivals and holidays. Gopnik posits that the modern Christmas is a compound holiday merging elements from numerous societies, traditions, and beliefs; that its moral foundations were established in the 1820/30s; its celebratory and commercialism elements were established in the 1870s. He also argues that stress and anxiety {{have been part of}} the holiday since the 1920s. [...] "Recreational Winter" [...] is about winter sports, like ice hockey. The evolution of ice skating is identified from the Dutch bringing the concept to England in the 1600s and the origin of hockey is traced back to a particular neighbourhood in Montreal in the 1800s. He portrays winter sports as being more about preparation and the pleasure of solitude, in contrast with summer sports, which are more about impulse. The final chapter, [...] "Remembering Winter", discusses three ways that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>experience</b> of winter is changing: through technological and architectural innovations, via global warming, and by memory.|$|E
