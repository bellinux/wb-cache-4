This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a D-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.|$|E

Cohort survival rates were considered low for both <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>and</b> secondary levels at 66.23% and 68.93%, respectively. For {{the school year}} 1996–97, dropout rate {{at the secondary level}} was high, especially in Butuan City (9.5%) and Surigao Del Sur (7.8%).

25|$|Yokneam Illit's {{accelerated}} {{demand for}} {{day care and}} Kindergartens led to a shortage of space in local day care and Kindergartens {{at the same time}} that there was a shortage of children at some of the Kibbutzim. In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children's houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>and</b> secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.|$|E

25|$|Minnesotan law {{provides}} that public {{elementary and middle}} schools offer at least three and require at least two courses in the following four arts areas: dance, music, theater and visual arts.

25|$|In Lebanon, the {{government}} sponsored the first training {{of school counselors}} for public {{elementary and middle schools}} in 1996. There are now school counselors in about 1/5 of <b>the</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>and</b> middle schools in Lebanon and none in the high schools. They have been trained in delivering preventive, developmental, and remedial services. Private schools have some school counselors serving all grade levels but the focus is exclusively individual counseling and primarily remedial. Challenges include regular violence and wartime strife and not enough resources and a lack of a professional school counseling organization, assignment of school counselors to cover more than one school at a time, and only two school counseling graduate programs in the country. Last, for persons trained in Western models of school counseling there are dangers of overlooking unique cultural and family aspects of Lebanese society.|$|E
