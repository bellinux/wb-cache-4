40|$|Abstract Background Fanconi anemia (FA) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive syndrome characterized by developmental abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and predisposition to cancer. The key FA protein FANCD 2 crosstalks with members of DNA damage and repair pathways that {{also play a role}} at telomeres. Therefore, we investigated whether FANCD 2 has a similar involvement at telomeres. Results We reveal that FANCD 2 may perform a novel function separate to the FANCD 2 /BRCA pathway. <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>includes</b> FANCD 2 interaction with one of the telomere components, the PARP family member tankyrase- 1. Moreover, FANCD 2 inhibits tankyrase- 1 activity in vitro. In turn, FANCD 2 deficiency increases the polyADP-ribosylation of telomere binding factor TRF 1. Conclusions FANCD 2 binding and inhibiting tankyrase- 1 PARsylation at telomeres may provide an additional step within the FA pathway for the regulation of genomic integrity. </p...|$|E

The terminal is a microcomputer system that shares a block of memory with some specialized video generation hardware. Data that is stored in the memory by the microcomputer is made to appear as characters on the video screen by the hardware. The primary function of the microcomputer is to accept ASCII characters from a host system and cause them to be displayed on the screen in the appropriate place. <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>includes</b> interpretation of control characters (e. g. carriage return, line feed) and maintenance of a cursor.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a modification of}} receptor theory for the estima-tion of observed affinities (Kobs) and relative efficacies of or-thosteric ligands in functional assays that exhibit constitutive activity. Our theory includes parameters for the fractions of the occupied receptor population in the active (intrinsic efficacy,) and inactive (i) states and analogous parameters for the frac-tions of the free receptor population in the active (sys) and inactive (i-sys) states. The total stimulus represents the sum-mation of the active states of the free and occupied receptor populations. A modified operational model is developed that expresses the response as a logistic function of the total stim-ulus. <b>This</b> <b>function</b> <b>includes</b> the standard parameters related to affinity and efficacy (Kobs and) {{as well as a}} parameter propor-tional to the activity of the free receptor complex, sys. Two related parameters are proportional to the fraction of the free (i-sys) and occupied (i) receptor populations in the inactive state. We show that the estimates of the affinity constants of orthosteric ligands for the active (Kb) and inactive (Ka) states of the receptor are equivalent to Kobs/sys and iKobs/i-sys, re-spectively. We verify our method with computer simulation techniques and apply it to the analysis of M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptors.

40|$|The motor system generates {{time-varying}} {{commands to}} move our limbs and body. Conventional descriptions of motor control and learning rely on dynamical representations of our body’s state (forward and inverse models), and control policies {{that must be}} integrated forward to generate feedforward time-varying commands; thus these are representations across space, but not time. Here we examine a new approach that directly represents both time-varying commands and the resulting state trajectories with a function; a representation across space and time. Since the output of <b>this</b> <b>function</b> <b>includes</b> time, it necessarily requires more parameters than a typical dynamical model. To avoid the problems of local minima these extra parameters introduce, we exploit recent advances in machine learning to build our function using a stacked autoencoder, or deep network. With initial and target states as inputs, this deep network can be trained to output an accurate temporal profile of the optimal command and state trajectory for a point-to-point reach of a nonlinear limb model, even when influenced by varying force fields. In a manner that mirrors motor babble, the network can also teach itself to learn through trial and error. Lastly, we demonstrate how this network can learn to optimize a cost objective. This functional approach to motor control is a sharp departure from the standard dynamical approach, and may offer {{new insights into the}} neural implementation of motor control...|$|E

Dosemeters are characterized with sup 9 sup 0 Sr- sup 9 sup 0 Y, calibrated with the energy of sup 6 sup 0 Co and irradiated with seven different qualities of x-ray beams, suggested by ANSI No. 13 and ISO 4037.
