5|$|Because of {{increased}} running <b>time,</b> <b>budget</b> and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E
25|$|As Chief of Staff, LeMay clashed {{repeatedly}} with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Air Force Secretary Eugene Zuckert, and {{the chairman}} of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Maxwell Taylor. At the <b>time,</b> <b>budget</b> constraints and successive nuclear war fighting strategies had left the armed forces in a state of flux. Each of the armed forces had gradually jettisoned realistic appraisals of future conflicts in favor of developing its own separate nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. At the height of this struggle, the U.S. Army had even reorganized its combat divisions to fight land wars on irradiated nuclear battlefields, developing short-range atomic cannon and mortars in order to win appropriations. The United States Navy in turn proposed delivering strategic nuclear weapons from supercarriers intended to sail into range of the Soviet air defense forces. Of all these various schemes, only LeMay's command structure of SAC survived complete reorganization in the changing reality of Cold War-era conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|Competitive chess became {{visible in}} 1834 with the LaBourdonnais-McDonnel matches, and the 1851 London Chess tournament raised {{concerns}} about the time taken by the players to deliberate their moves. On recording time {{it was found that}} players often took hours to analyze moves, and one player took as much as two hours and 20 minutes to think over a single move at the London tournament. The following years saw the development of speed chess, five-minute chess and the most popular variant, a version allowing a bank of time to each player in which to play a previously agreed number of moves, e.g. two hours for 30 moves. In the final variant, the player who made the predetermined number of moves in the agreed time received additional <b>time</b> <b>budget</b> for his next moves. Penalties for exceeding a time limit came in form of fines and forfeiture.

Findings are that passengers of Changzhou BRT need to budget, on average, an extra 3 – 5 minutes beyond their typical journey time for selected origin-destination pairs to ensure on-time arrival at destinations with 95 % probability. Extra <b>time</b> <b>budgeted</b> for bus waiting beyond mean waiting time contributes to more than 80 percent of extra <b>time</b> <b>budgeted</b> for a journey, while only 20 percent is budgeted for in-vehicle travel time.
