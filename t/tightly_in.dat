5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
25|$|Women {{in ancient}} Rome adopted {{a form of}} the Greek apodesme, known as the strophium or mamillare. Since the Romans {{regarded}} large breasts as comical, or characteristic of aging or unattractive women, young girls wore breast bands (fascia) secured <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> the belief that doing so would prevent overly large, sagging breasts.|$|E

25|$|Huddling: Prolonged {{physical}} contact or huddling also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, {{together with the}} transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact {{play a major role}} in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.|$|E
25|$|More {{remains were}} found {{the day after}} the ship's bell was rediscovered. These {{represented}} six or seven crewmen, and were found among the wreckage of the central portion of the ship near the conning tower. The bones were found in a confused mass, scorched by fire, and many were incomplete or fractured. Some were skulls which had portions missing, and many were small fragments. Workers reported that additional remains were wedged <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> twisted masses of steel, and could not be easily removed without the use of acetylene torches. The remains of another three to four men were found on the central superstructure on July 24. Again, some showed the action of fire.|$|E
25|$|The use of Chinese {{varieties}} is {{not controlled}} <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> traditional arts, such as Chinese opera. As such, they {{have managed to}} survive, and even flourish in these areas. In Singapore, various types of Chinese opera include Hokkien, Teochew, Hainanese and Cantonese. In the past, this diversity encouraged the translation between varieties for scripts of popular stories. After {{the implementation of the}} bilingual policy and Speak Mandarin Campaign, Mandarin subtitles were introduced to help the audience understand the performances. Today, as usage of English rises, some opera troupes not only provide English subtitles but also English translations of their works. For these English-Chinese operas, subtitles may be provided in either Mandarin, other Chinese varieties, or both. In this way, Chinese opera will be able to reach out to a wider audience despite being variety-specific.|$|E

25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

[...] Elite Moche graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large adobe structures also used for human sacrifices, such as the Huaca de la Luna.

500|$|At {{the time}} of her conception, Barbara Gordon's {{character}} was intended to reflect the women's liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered {{to be one of the}} most popular characters to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books. In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states: [...] "While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs." [...] Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections. Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair [...] "tied up <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative—not to say dowdy—clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day--busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior." [...] Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that [...] "uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{removal and}} fitting of {{cylinder}} liners in large engines requires {{the use of}} dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely slides into the engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting interference fit holds it <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> place. [...] Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{stability}} of the molecule {{is due to the}} 3 disulfide bonds linking the 6 cysteine members of the chain (Cys5-Cys55, Cys14-Cys38 and Cys30-Cys51).

2500|$|Whereas older {{instruments}} {{fitted with}} valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> the bell section (closed wrap [...] or traditional wrap), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (open wrap), {{resulting in a}} freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks {{out from behind the}} bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.|$|E
2500|$|Each string {{is wound}} around a tuning pin, {{normally}} {{at the end}} of the string closer to the player. [...] When rotated with a wrench or tuning hammer, the tuning pin adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch. [...] Tuning pins are held <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> holes drilled in the pinblock or wrestplank, an oblong hardwood plank. Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the nut, a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank. [...] The section of the string beyond the nut forms its vibrating length, which is plucked and creates sound.|$|E

[...] Using {{materials from the}} Moon is attractive because launch from the Moon is in theory far less complicated than from Earth. [...] There is no atmosphere, and so components {{do not need to}} be packed <b>tightly</b> <b>in</b> an aeroshell and survive vibration, pressure and temperature loads. Launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely. [...] Launch from the Moon the GEO also requires far less energy than from Earth's much deeper gravity well. [...] Building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the Moon.|$|E
