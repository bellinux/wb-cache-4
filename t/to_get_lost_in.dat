He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to The Man from London generally praised its formalist aesthetic and painstakingly composed scenes, while criticizing its slow pace {{and lack of}} a compelling plot. Most argued the film fell short of Tarr's previous efforts. Varietys Derek Elley rated the film {{on a par with}} his Damnation (1988) but as inferior to Sátántangó (1994) and Werckmeister Harmonies (2000), remarking it was improbable that The Man From London would {{put an end to the}} polarization of Tarr's audiences into those who hail him as a director of [...] "visionary genius" [...] and those for whom he is a [...] "crashing bore". Martin Tsai of The New York Sun allowed that Tarr [...] "makes it easy for viewers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> his beautifully bleak world and lose track of time" [...] but complained that in comparison with its predecessors, the film's central theme of guilt seemed insubstantial and the film itself felt [...] "slight and incomplete".|$|E

[...] AbsolutePunks Ian Walker praised Ocean on the track, writing: [...] "his verse and chorus showcase both sides of his expertise, as he can write both hip-hop and R influenced vocals with ease. While “She” tends <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the midst of heavier tracks like “Yonkers” and “Transylvania,” it deserves a ton of recognition for leaning a bit more towards a mainstream sound Odd Future isn't known for while staying true to their original vision." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnston's {{plan was}} to attack Grant's left, {{separate}} the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the woods and others to grind to a halt faced with heavy traffic jams. [...] It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio {{was too far away}} to be of any aid to Grant. [...] Instead, it would happen on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. [...] Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. [...] They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out rations by the time the battle commenced.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were recorded on tape and Pro-Tools simultaneously; the band ultimately {{chose to use}} the tape version, as they preferred its sound quality. [...] Most songs were recorded live with the band members playing together in one room, and microphones set up to capture the overall sound rather than that of individual instruments. [...] Was felt this approach best approximated {{the feel of a}} Black Crowes concert, later noting that the Lions songs debuted at a private show in [...] "sounded exactly like the record." [...] Most of the recordings that comprise the album were recorded during preproduction, the purpose of which was to test arrangements. [...] "e didn't think we were recording the record.

[...] Audley Freed played guitar on only three tracks because Rich did not want [...] "the meat of the song, which is the riff", <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "wall of sound". Though Rich brought his entire collection of guitars and a number of amplifiers, he mostly recorded with a 1954 Fender Esquire through a Harry Joyce amp. [...] To achieve a resonator-like tone on [...] "Soul Singing", he used a James Trussart metal-bodied electric. [...] Since Andy Hess did not join The Black Crowes until the above private show, the band did not have a bassist during the recording sessions; Rich thus played bass on most tracks.

One wonders if the movie is too ambitious, facetious and hip for its own box-office good". Film critic Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "I didn't find it hard to accept the uninflected, deadpan tone, and to enjoy Buckaroo Banzai for its inventiveness and the gags that bounce off other adventure movies, other comedies.

2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in,</b> but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E

Rocko reluctantly tells Hubie about his desire to fly and live in tropical climate. He convinces him to help him return to Antarctica by making up a lie about a flying penguin named Waldo.
