Five hundred pounds isn't so much,--and surely I {{have a right to}} some share. And you may be sure of this; when we're settled, Brisket is not the man <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for more, as some would do." [...] And then she gave another look at Robinson.|$|E

[...] "Lady Harry may be persuaded <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{when we want}} her for our grand project. In the {{meantime}} (for I am always a considerate man where women are concerned) we act delicately towards my lady, in sparing her the discovery of--what shall I call our coming enterprise?--venturesome villainy, which might ruin you in your wife's estimation. Do you see our situation now, as it really is? Very well. Pass the bottle, and drop the subject for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stupid women, {{and all are}} stupid, {{think the}} first winning of the man the final victory. Then they settle down and grow fat, and state, and dead, and heartbroken. Alas, they are so stupid. But you, little infant-woman with your first victory, you must make your love-life an unending chain of victories. Each day you must win your man again. And when you have won the last victory, when you can find no more to win, then ends love. Finis is written, and your man wanders in strange gardens. Remember, love must be kept insatiable. It must have an {{appetite}} knife-edged and never satisfied. You must feed your lover well, ah, very well, most well; give, give, yet send him away hungry <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wait--I've {{got more}} to tell you, {{that you ought}} to know. I shouldn't be here to-day if Nancy Durrett had consented to--to get a divorce and marry me. We had agreed to that when this {{accident}} happened to Ham, and she went back to him. I {{have to tell you that}} I still love her--I can't say how much, or define my feelings toward her now. I've given up all idea of her. I don't think I'd marry her now, even if I had the chance, and you should decide to live away from me. I don't know. I'm not so sure of myself as I once was. The fact is, Maude, circumstances have been too much for me. I've been beaten. And I'm not at all certain that it wasn't a cowardly thing for me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt," [...] said Dinah, [...] "I promise <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in {{the winter}} if you're ill. Don't think I will ever stay away from you if you're in real want of me. But, indeed, it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoy--at least that I should go away for a short space. No one can know but myself what are my inward needs, and the besetments I am most in danger from. Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest {{the love of the}} {{creature}} should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{remains to}} comfort you? I hope {{you may be}} comforted;--that is all. Don't be too particular. Let her choose her own friends, and go her own gait, and have her own way, and do you be blind and deaf and dumb and {{properly}} submissive; {{and it may be}} that she'll give you your breakfast and dinner in your own house,--so long as your hours don't interfere with her pleasures. If she should even urge you beside yourself by her vanity, folly, and disobedience,--so that at last you are driven to express your feeling,--no doubt she will come to you after a while and tell you with the sweetest condescension that she forgives you. When she has been out of your house for a twelvemonth or more, she will offer <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and to forget everything,--on condition that you will do exactly as she bids you for the future." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To-morrow is Saturday. Send the housemaid {{out in your}} walking {{dress of}} to-day, just as you propose; but don't stir out yourself, and don't go near the window. Desire the woman to keep her veil down, to take half an hour's walk (quite unconscious, of course, of the parson or his servant at her heels), and then <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> As soon as she appears, send her {{instantly}} to the open window, instructing her to lift her veil carelessly and look out. Let her go away again {{after a minute or}} two, take off her bonnet and shawl, and then appear once more at the window, or, better still, in the balcony outside. She may show herself again occasionally (not too often) later in the day. And to-morrow--as we have a professional gentleman to deal with--by all means send her to church. If these proceedings don't persuade the parson that the house-maid's face is your face, and if they don't make him readier to believe in your reformed character than he was when I spoke to him, I have lived sixty years, my love, in this vale of tears to mighty little purpose.|$|E
