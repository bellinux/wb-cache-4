Energy utilization of an animal is closely related to its ability to adapt to its environment. Assessing an animal 2 ̆ 7 s response to its environment has proven difficult due to the complex interplay of the environment and the animal. This report develops a measure of a dynamic overall heat transfer coefficient, or <b>thermal</b> <b>index,</b> based upon a noninvasive tympanic temperature measurement. The relative <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> for swine was objectively determined from analysis of the transient response of tympanic temperature of six crossbred barrows exposed to three distinct thermal environments. The three environments (treatments) compared in a repeated Latin square design with subsampling were: 28 ∘C with a low air speed; 28 ∘C with a high air speed; and 18 ∘C with low air speed. ^ The transient thermodynamic response of each pig was determined by analysis of the tympanic temperature spike associated with a meal event. Each suitable temperature spike was processed by a statistical exponential curve fitting algorithm generating the <b>thermal</b> <b>index,</b> K. <b>Thermal</b> <b>index</b> values occurred as subsamples within the Latin square design since multiple meal events were allowed for each treatment. ^ Analysis of <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> means from the repeated Latin square showed that an air temperature of 28 ∘C with low wind speed was a significantly different (P = 0. 0205) thermal environment compared to the other two treatments. This result supported a preliminary analysis of the projected impact of the prescribed thermal environments based on steady state assumptions. The <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> {{has been shown to be}} a measure of the overall heat transfer coefficient which relates the pig 2 ̆ 7 s rate of heat loss to its thermal environment by evaluation of the dynamics of the tympanic temperature record. ^ The objectively determined <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> provides a noninvasive integrated response of a pig to its thermal environment. Researchers can use this biologically based measure to link thermal conditions to performance in optimizing swine production. ...|$|E

40|$|Heat stress {{impaired}} productive, reproductive {{and animal}} behaviour. Examination of milk production loss due to heat stress was mainly evaluated in USA and few tropical countries using the temperature humidity index (THI 1) {{developed in the}} 1950 ’s. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of six new environmental stress indices on production traits in a temperate region. These indices include solar radiation and wind speed in addition to the temperature and humidity only defining THI 1. For that purpose, 530820 milk, fat, protein, and somatic cell count first-lactation test-day records (TD) collected between 2000 and 2011 in Luxembourg were used. TD records were merged with meteorological data from 14 public weather stations. Each TD was assigned to the average daily <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> of the 3 days before. Firstly, broken-line regression models were applied to identify the threshold of heat stress (THR) for each of the thermal indices. The decline of daily production of the different traits above THR point was assessed by mixed linear models including regression on unit of each of the <b>thermal</b> <b>index.</b> Estimates of THR were specific to each <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> and trait. Significant decrease of milk, fat and protein yields above THR was observed for all studied thermal predictors. Whereas, an increase of the somatic cell score was observed above the specific THR point. THR estimates for THI 1 and THI 6 were of 68 and 80 and 62 and 78 for milk and protein yields respectively. Respective rate of decline per unit were of 0. 243 and 0. 188 kg and 0. 0045 and 0. 0051 kg respectively.
