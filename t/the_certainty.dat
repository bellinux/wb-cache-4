5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>certainty</b> of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried <b>the</b> <b>certainty</b> of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with <b>the</b> <b>certainty</b> that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in <b>the</b> <b>certainty</b> of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E

40|$|The {{somewhat}} ad-hoc {{method of}} certainty calibration, based on self-stated preference certainty follow-up questions, {{has been found}} to be a successful method of eliminating or reducing hypothetical bias in stated preference studies.

Estimated bivariate probit models provide no evidence for systematic individual-specific answers to <b>the</b> preference <b>certainty</b> follow-up questions of different contexts.
