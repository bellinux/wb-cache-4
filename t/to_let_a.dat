5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> sale go through, {{but this time the}} lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi helped Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him {{a key player in}} South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ helped rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he helped Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and helped to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi wanted <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Scientology {{strongly}} opposed the book's publication. The Church {{was accused of}} organising a smear and harassment campaign against Miller and his publisher, though it strenuously denied this accusation, and a private investigator involved in the campaign denied that the Church was his client. However, a leak of internal Church documents to the press in 1990 disclosed many details of the campaign. The Church and related corporate entities attempted to prevent the book's publication in court, resulting in cases that reached the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the Federal Court of Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> lower court's ruling stand, denying fair use protection for the book's use of unpublished sources, set a precedent favouring copyright protection of unpublished material over biographers' freedom of speech. Courts in the UK and Canada took an opposite view, allowing publication of Bare-faced Messiah in the public interest.|$|E

The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs.|$|E

25|$|The Natchez Rebellion {{expanded}} {{into a larger}} regional conflict with many repercussions. The Yazoo and Koroa Indians had allied with the Natchez and suffered their fate. The Tunica were initially reluctant to fight on either side. In June 1730 the Head Chief of the Tunica, Cahura-Joligo, agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> small party of Natchez refugees settle near his village, {{with the provision that}} they should do so unarmed.

But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> musical motif endure a fate. In any case, a programme should be added to a piece of music only if it was necessarily needed for an adequate understanding of that piece.|$|E
25|$|Though Hitler hated Jewish {{people and}} wanted them {{expelled}} from Germany, in 1933 the Nazis were not willing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> {{large number of}} Jewish refugees flee to the surrounding nations. This was because Reich officials were concerned that fleeing Jewish refugees would lend large numbers to a growing international movement for the economic boycott of Germany. Adding to Hitler's worries, German financial advisers warned the Nazi government that a mass exodus of Jewish laborers from the German workforce would badly damage Germany's economic stability. The Nazis needed a convenient solution to rid themselves of Jews without a political or economic backlash.|$|E
25|$|Later on, the organistrum {{was made}} smaller <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> single player both turn the crank and work the keys. The solo organistrum was known from Spain and France, but was largely {{replaced}} by the symphonia, a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, {{a new form of}} key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the symphonia show both types of keys.|$|E

In Steelmill/Stahlwerk, a 1979 documentary made in collaboration with Clara Weyergraf, Serra explores the physical construction of an art piece {{and at the same time}} examines the lives of the steelmill.

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} a screenplay for The Terminator, Cameron {{decided to sell}} it {{so that he could}} direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called Hemdale Pictures, which was willing to let him direct. Gale Anne Hurd, who had started her own production company, Pacific Western Productions, had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as a producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. Orion Pictures distributed the film. Hurd and Cameron were married from 1985 to 1989.|$|E

25|$|On June 9, {{the federal}} {{government}} approved that the last section of NY214 was eligible for federal aid, {{at the cost of}} $700,000 (1952USD), which would be subsidized by half by the government. However, due to the approval being announced late in the fiscal year, there was no ability on part of the state <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> bid contract until the next, as all state money for the year had dried up. The $700,000 project would go to four miles of grading, drainage structures, three bridges and paving of two lanes through Greene County. The federal government announced they would approve construction bidding once the state sent documents noting they acquired rights-of-way for the project. However, by July 30, no progress was made by the state on construction despite federal approval according to J. Ernest Wharton, a United States Congressman from Richmondville.|$|E
25|$|With an {{appreciation}} that {{both men were}} {{to blame for the}} altercation, Banner gives Bond the assignment he craves: the rocket-powered X-2, which is designed to fly to the edge of outer space. The general insists, however, on piloting the first test flight at full power, despite strong pressure from his superior, Lieutenant General Bryan Shelby (Paul Fix), <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> younger man take on the dangerous job. When Bond is assigned to fly the last half-power test before the main flight, he goes to full power without authorization and barely survives a high-altitude bailout when the aircraft goes out of control. The base flight surgeon tells Banner that only a young, fit person could have survived, leading the general to accept a promotion and transfer. He recommends Colonel McKee as his successor. Although Banner offers to take Connie with him to his new assignment, she decides to stay with Bond.|$|E

Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>a</b> couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
