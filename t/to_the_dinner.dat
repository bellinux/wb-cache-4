Though rarely used, men can also substitute a tailcoat for the standard dinner dress jacket with this uniform. The female version is substantially the same as Dinner Dress Blue Jacket, but substitutes the mother-of-pearl studs and cuff links for gold. This uniform is equivalent to white tie in usage. Additionally, this uniform is only prescribed for chiefs and officers.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} few run-ins, Saša is {{sufficiently}} intrigued with Koka that he tracks {{her down and}} ends up sleeping with her in her apartment. Afterwards, he informs her that he doesn't want to pursue things further, which she takes in stride to his face, passing it all off as a light fling, but looks visibly shaken after he leaves. He decides to stay with Branka and is soon informed by her that she's pregnant so the parents quickly set about organizing a wedding. Meanwhile, Giga decides to call on his Pomoravlje paisano connections {{in order to find}} Saša a job. He wants to track down his old friend Jataganac who's now a powerful politically connected party-installed business manager. Though he manages to get Jataganac's attention after much wrangling, the whole thing eventually goes pear-shaped when Giga refuses to swallow his pride when Jataganac shows up four hours late <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> at Popadić's house.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1kg of meat {{requires}} up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires {{nearly half of}} the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E

25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized {{the sound of an}} oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going to}} have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner.</b> Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood up for her. In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, and banged on Gellhorn's door with a mop, demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, was in one of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E
25|$|Together with Agatha, {{he begins}} investigating. They {{discover}} a viscous substance {{left behind by}} the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. The Doctor and Agatha question the guests while Donna searches the bedrooms for clues. While searching, Donna hears a strange buzzing noise. Opening the curtains, she sees, instead of a harmless, trapped bee like she expected, there is a ridiculously gigantic wasp outside. It smashes through the window and attacks Donna, but she fights back with light from a magnifying glass and it embeds its sting in the door but escapes through the window before the Doctor and Agatha arrive. The Doctor examines the wasp's sting embedded in the door, and collects a honey like-substance from the sting. The alien kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala, by crushing her with a gargoyle, and the Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase it but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor deduces that the creature is a Vespiform, an extraterrestrial wasp species that lives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Suddenly, the Doctor is poisoned with cyanide in lemonade laced with bitter almonds. His Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify, with Donna's help. The poisoning inspires him to add pepper <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> meal, since the piperine in it would act as an insecticide. As they eat, the guests hear the wasp but the lights in the room are blown out before the alien's identity is revealed. When the lights are restored, they discover that Lady Eddison's necklace has been stolen and that her son Roger has been stabbed in the back with a bread knife.|$|E

40|$|Between 1907 and 1911, {{executives}} of American steel manufacturers {{gathered in a}} series of social events and meetings that became known as <b>the</b> Gary <b>dinners.</b> Their founder, Judge Elbert H. Gary, {{chairman of the board of}} the United States Steel Corporation (U. S.

It brought suit in 1911, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> as one of the reasons why the court should dissolve U. S. Steel as an illegal monopoly. Nine years later, the Supreme Court held that <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> amounted <b>to</b> price fixing. <b>The</b> Court went on to hold, however, that U. S. Steel 2 ̆ 7 s resort <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> only proved that it lacked <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> control steel prices on its own and, therefore, could not have unilaterally monopolized the industry. Commentators have long questioned the Court 2 ̆ 7 s result on the issue of monopolization. This essay, however, will focus on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s intermediate conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>dinners</b> were concerted action, a result that was by no means obvious in antitrust 2 ̆ 7 s formative period, when the case was decided. I argue that the reasoning that led to this conclusion, especially by the trial judges in the case, can still shed light on the agreement element of section 1 of the Sherman Act...|$|R

Amir is an American-born, Muslim-raised Manhattan mergers and {{acquisitions}} lawyer, while Emily is an up-and-coming artist who focuses on Islamic themes in her art. Amir has cast aside his Muslim heritage {{for the sake of}} his career and serves as Emily's muse, who has an affinity for Islamic artistic traditions. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner,</b> Amir, who is on the partner track, becomes involved in a controversial case. Amir's assimilated nephew, Abe (born Hussein Malik), has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped-up of financing terrorist-supporting groups, leading Amir to question whether it is religious persecution. Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam, in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times. The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory, a colleague from work, and her husband, Isaac, who is Emily's Jewish art dealer. In all, the dinner table assembly includes an ex-Muslim, an African-American, a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith. The conversation touches upon [...] "Islamic and Judaic tradition, the Quran and the Talmud, racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu" [...] as tensions mount. When Amir admits he felt a [...] "blush of pride" [...] on September 11th, and holds secret animosity toward Israel, his friends are disgusted. Jory and Amir leave the apartment to get a bottle of champagne. It is revealed that Isaac and Emily have had an affair in the past, and that he is secretly in love with her. Jory and Amir return just as Isaac is about to kiss Emily. It is revealed that Jory has been selected as partner in the law firm over Amir, in part because of his presence at the imam's trial, and in a rage he calls her [...] "nigger". Jory and Isaac depart, the status of their relationship uncertain after Isaac's infidelity has been revealed. Emily confesses her affair with Isaac and Amir beats her. Abe stumbles into the apartment and finds him standing over her. The play jumps ahead a period of time. Amir is packing his belongings and preparing to leave the apartment. Emily brings Abe over for legal advice. He was questioned by the FBI after his friend expressed a Jihadist sentiment at a Starbucks. Amir warns Abe to be more cautious, but Abe flies into a fit of rage, saying that the West has [...] "disgraced" [...] Islam, but that they will take it all back one day. He storms out. Amir tries to reconcile with Emily, but she leaves.|$|E
