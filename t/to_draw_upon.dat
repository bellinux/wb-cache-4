5|$|Taraborrelli {{decided to}} focus on the singer's private life; who she really was. Many books about the superstar were based on {{previously}} published material, but Taraborrelli had ten years of research <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> including interviews with people who had not spoken about Madonna in public and his own interviews with the icon. Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna's close friends, business associates, and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> that tradition.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli's time as {{the pastor}} of Glarus and Einsiedeln was {{characterized}} by inner growth and development. He perfected his Greek and he took up the study of Hebrew. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> classical, patristic, and scholastic works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli {{took the opportunity to}} meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative pacifism and his focus on preaching {{can be traced to the}} influence of Erasmus.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{formation}} of the 4th Brigade in England, in response to a request made by the British War Office to the New Zealand government for another infantry division. Although their numbers were insufficient for a new division, personnel from New Zealand were arriving in the various NZEF depots in Europe at a much higher rate than they were being lost from the division due to casualties and attrition. By early 1917, there was a reserve of around 10,000 men available with which <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> for the new brigade without adversely affecting the ability to replace existing troops in the field, in the short term at least. The brigade's core units were four infantry battalions designated as the 3rd Battalions of the Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago Regiments. Newly promoted Brigadier General Herbert Ernest Hart was appointed by Godley as the brigade's commander, and after a rigorous training programme, curtailed by orders to report to France, it embarked for the front on 29 May 1917. With four infantry brigades, the New Zealand Division was now the strongest Dominion formation fighting in France with 20,000 personnel. However, Russell did not like his division's four-brigade structure (the remainder of the British and Dominion infantry divisions had three brigades) as he continually had to fend off requests to use the extra brigade for labouring work in the corps rear area.|$|E

Universal Studios drew on a Balkan tale of a plant associated with lycanthropy as there was no literary work <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon,</b> unlike the case with vampires. There is no reference to silver nor other aspects of werewolf lore such as cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|As {{the city}} grew, it began <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> its {{hinterland}} for population growth. Much {{of the surrounding}} countryside {{to the east and}} the north of the city was (and is) inhabited primarily by French-Acadians who were descendants of the refugees that had returned to the region following the deportation of 1755. For the 150 years between its founding by the Pennsylvania Dutch in 1766 and the 1920s, the city of Moncton itself had been an English speaking community but the influx of francophone Acadians seeking employment beginning in the early 20th century would result in a major demographic and cultural shift for the community.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fiscal}} {{guardian}} for the nation's past reserves (that is, reserves not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office), the President's concurrence {{is required for}} a number of financial transactions that the Government may wish to enter into. A guarantee may only be given or a loan raised by the Government if the President concurs, whether the transaction is authorized by a resolution of Parliament or is made under one of eight specified statutes. The President's approval is also needed for budgets of specified statutory boards and Government companies that draw on their past reserves. The statutory boards that come under the President's purview are the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board), the Housing and Development Board, JTC Corporation and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, while the Government companies are the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte. Ltd., MND Holdings Pte. Ltd., and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. Before the start of its financial year, every statutory board and {{the board of directors of}} every Government company must present its budget for that financial year to the President, together with a declaration by the statutory board's chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), or the Government company's chairman of the board of directors and the CEO, as to whether the budget is likely <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> past reserves. If so, the President may exercise personal discretion to disapprove the budget. If he approves the budget even though he is of the opinion that the budget is likely <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> past reserves, the decision and opinion must be published in the Government Gazette. Similarly, statutory boards and Government companies are bound to inform the President of financial transactions that are likely to draw on past reserves, and the President has personal discretion as to whether such transactions should be approved.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of Ruairi's death in 1198, King Henry II of England had invaded Ireland and given the part of it he {{controlled}} to his son John as a Lordship when John was just 10 in 1177. When John succeeded to the English throne in 1199, he remained Lord of Ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland into personal union. By the mid-13th century, while the island was nominally ruled by the king of England, from c.1260 the effective area of control began to recede. As various Cambro-Norman noble families died out in the male line, the Gaelic nobility began to reclaim lost territory. Successive English kings did little to stem the tide, instead using Ireland <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> men and supplies in the wars in Scotland and France.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} urban youth {{growing up in}} the working-class neighborhoods of Antananarivo, Rossy casually improvised with his friends to create songs in the vakisôva genre. This {{contemporary}} Malagasy musical genre is characterized by politically and socially incisive lyrics delivered a capella in a rhythmic, rap-like style over complex hand-clapping beats. Long after vakisôva performance launched his career, Rossy continued <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> its rhythms and sensibilities as a vehicle for expressing bold political and social critique while capitalizing on the genre's dance-inducing entertainment value. As a consequence, {{by the time he had}} achieved national popularity under his stage name Rossy in the early 1990s, he had developed a reputation for speaking truth to power and being unafraid to address sensitive issues through his music. Many of Rossy's songs raise awareness of such issues as environmental degradation and poor governance.|$|E
25|$|The Gotha G.II was {{an entirely}} new biplane {{designed}} by Hans Burkhard, who had previously reworked Oskar Ursinus's design for the G.I to make it suitable for mass-production. Burkhard abandoned the G.I's unorthodox configuration {{in favor of a}} more conventional design with the fuselage mounted on the bottom wing rather than the top. In deciding this, he had the benefit of greater pilot experience <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon.</b> The difficulties of asymmetric thrust created by losing an engine on a twin-engine design had proved to be not nearly as bad as Ursinus had originally believed, and therefore the G.I's unusual design was really an answer to a non-existent problem. Furthermore, Burkhard had the opportunity to rebuild a crashed G.I (serial number 9/15) and re-arrange its components to place the fuselage on the lower wing, and found this design workable, while also removing the grave danger to the crew that landing accidents posed.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to spending cuts, Romney and the legislature {{relied heavily on}} fee increases to help balance the budgets throughout Romney's term, more aggressively pursuing a revenue source that the legislature had already begun <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> to close a deep deficit during the year prior to Romney’s election. The state of Massachusetts raised $500 million in new revenue during Romney’s {{first year in office}} from fees, more than any other state surveyed. Romney proposed 33 new fees along with increases in 57 existing fees, resulting in higher costs for birth certificates, new car purchases, driver’s learning permits, firearms permits, professional licenses, and billboards advertising, as well as for many state services. He also increased a state gasoline fee originally intended for cleanup of contamination around underground fuel storage tanks. The two cents per gallon increase made for a total effective state gasoline tax of 23.5 cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue (surpluses of $40 million over the costs of the cleanup program). Opponents said many of the fees posed a hardship on those who could least afford them, such as fees for the state to provide certification of blindness and a photo identification card for the blind. The proposal also called for a $50 fee for tuberculosis tests and a $400 fee for those who tested positive (the tuberculosis fees were rejected by the legislature).|$|E
25|$|From around 1922, Pușcariu {{approached}} various {{intellectuals and}} politicians {{with the goal}} of creating new institutions for the preservation of cultural identity. With Vintilă Brătianu and Nistor, he set up the Brătianu Foundation, which financed a network of summer schools for adult education. With Iorga's assistance, Pușcariu established the Museum of the Romanian Language, a research institute he had conceived in early 1917, while on the front. The large group of collaborators and students who advanced the language as an academic discipline {{came to be known as}} the Cluj School of linguistics. Rather than confine himself to a narrow field, Pușcariu incorporated linguistics, history, sociology and even literature into his studies, constantly referring to research in other disciplines. He introduced Romanian linguistics to the theories of Meyer-Lübke, particularly as they related to the form of Latin that underpins the language; to Matteo Bartoli's ideas about the isolated and peripheral position of the language; and to Jules Gilliéron's dialectological notions. In terms of Romanian scholars, he incorporated the archaeological findings of Vasile Pârvan, as well as the sociological and folkloric studies of Simion Mehedinți and Romulus Vuia. His respect for their opinions led him <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>upon</b> the work of Densusianu, Candrea, Constantin C. Giurescu, Iorgu Iordan, Alexandru Rosetti, Alexandru Graur and others. He had over eight hundred articles and numerous books to his name. In 1930, he helped organize a Folklore Archive within the museum building; led by Ion Mușlea, this was the country's first institution dedicated exclusively to the study of its folklore tradition.|$|E
