50|$|This was an {{expensive}} war fought over disputed territory bordering the Amazon. On September 21, 1857 Ecuador decided to adjudicate to Britain territories in the Canelos region as payment for international debt it had incurred {{during the war}} of independence. Peru immediately protested the Ecuadorian action citing the uti possidetis juris principle by which the Canelos region would belong to Peru, based on the <b>territorial</b> <b>concession</b> of 1802 to the Viceroyalty of Peru. Despite Peruvian complaints, Ecuador proceeded in its negotiations with the British. This led to an 1859 occupation and blockade of Guayaquil by President Castilla. (Ecuador {{at the time was}} undergoing a civil struggle.) On February 25, 1860, Peruvian minister Manuel Morales and his Ecuadorian counterpart, Nicolás Estrada, signed the Treaty of Mapasingue in order to end the dispute. (Mapasingue is a location near Guayaquil where Peruvian troops had been stationed.) Ecuador voided the concession of territories claimed by Peru to the British, and Peru withdrew its forces. However, the territorial situation remained unclear and was left to be resolved at a later time.|$|E
5000|$|....."Once pacification {{had been}} accomplished, Fascist Italy {{endeavored}} to convert Libya into an Italian province {{to be referred}} to popularly as Italys Fourth Shore. In 1934 Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were divided into four provinces--Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, and Darnah--which were formally linked as a single colony known as Italian Libya, thus officially resurrecting the name that Diocletian had applied nearly 1,500 years earlier. Fezzan, designated as South Tripolitania, remained a military territory. A governor general, called the first consul after 1937, was in overall direction of the colony, assisted by the General Consultative Council, on which Arabs were represented. Traditional tribal councils, formerly sanctioned by the Italian administration, were abolished, and all local officials were thereafter appointed by the governor general. Administrative posts at all levels were held by Italians. An accord with Britain and Egypt obtained the transfer of a corner of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, known as the Sarra Triangle, to Italian control in 1934. The next year, a French-Italian agreement was negotiated that relocated the 1,000-kilometer border between Libya and Chad southward about 100 kilometers across the Aouzou Strip, but this <b>territorial</b> <b>concession</b> to Italy was never ratified by the French legislature. In 1939 Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy. During the 1930s, impressive strides were made in improving the countrys economic and transportation infrastructure. Italy invested capital and technology in public works projects, extension and modernization of cities, highway and railroad construction, expanded port facilities, and irrigation, but these measures were introduced to benefit the Italian-controlled modern sector of the economy. Italian development policy after World War I had called for capital-intensive [...] "economic colonization" [...] intended to promote the maximum exploitation of the resources available. One of the initial Italian objectives in Libya, however, had been the relief of overpopulation and unemployment in Italy through emigration to the undeveloped colony. With security established, systematic [...] "demographic colonization" [...] was encouraged by Mussolinis government. A project initiated by Libyas governor, Italo Balbo, brought the first 20,000 settlers — the ventimilli — to Libya in a single convoy in October 1938. More settlers followed in 1939, and by 1940 there were approximately 110,000 Italians in Libya, constituting about 12 percent of the total population. Plans envisioned an Italian colony of 500,000 settlers by the 1960s. Libyas best land was allocated to the settlers to be brought under productive cultivation, primarily in olive groves. Settlement was directed by a state corporation, the Libyan Colonization Society, which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake and credit facilities to the settlers it had sponsored. The Italians made modern medical care available {{for the first time in}} Libya, improved sanitary conditions in the towns, and undertook to replenish the herds and flocks that had been depleted during the war. But, although Mussolini liked to refer to the Libyans as [...] "Muslim Italians," [...] little more was accomplished that directly improved the living standards of the Arab population.|$|E

50|$|A {{relative}} moderate, Baron Burián initially resisted German {{pressure for}} <b>territorial</b> <b>concessions</b> {{as the price}} of maintaining Italy's neutrality, although he somewhat vacillated towards the end as Austro-Hungarian forces suffered a crushing defeat with the surrender of Przemysl in March.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt, and Israel and Syria. The objective {{of the study is}} to explain why Israel managed to obtain a peace agreement with Egypt, but not with Syria. The two cases are seemingly similar in content and the parties’ positions towards each. The major difference lies in the negotiation outcome; while Egypt achieved a peace agreement and regained the control over the Sinai Peninsula, Syria is without a peace agreement and still claims sovereignty over the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. The examination focuses on the time periods 1977 - 1979, when the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations were undertaken, and 1991 - 2000, when Israel and Syria conducted their long period of peace talks. Relying on negotiation theory in order to explain the negotiation outcomes, I have structured the thesis around three explanatory factors. The first is bargaining strength which constitutes five sub-categories that is directed towards negotiation tactics. These are; degree of impatience, risk of breakdown, inside option, asymmetrical information, and issue delinkage. All of the five categories represent tactical behaviours that determine the party’s bargaining strength and may be employed {{to take advantage of the}} opponent. These behaviours are directed to influence the opponent in an attempt to achieve the best possible agreement. In addition to the bargaining strength, I explore the role of the mediator. In both negotiations the US worked as a mediator between Israel and the Arab states. As a powerful third party with close connections to Israel, the US may have affected the negotiation outcome. The final explanatory factor is concentrated towards the Israeli public opinion. This factor is further divided into two subcategories; commitment tactics and domestic politics. The former constitutes a behaviour tactic in order to create credibility behind a party’s negotiation position, and the latter is a simplified form of Putnam’s two-level game. The findings from this examination indicate that Israel, to a certain degree, employed the same negotiation tactics in both peace negotiations. However, the major difference seems to be that while Egypt was affected by the negotiation tactics, Syria occurred indifferent towards the Israeli behaviour. Another difference that seemed to be crucial for the Israeli position was the public’s attitude towards the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. While Israeli public supported the <b>territorial</b> <b>concession</b> of the Sinai Peninsula, they opposed the concessions of the Golan Heights...|$|E
