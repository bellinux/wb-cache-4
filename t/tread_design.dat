5000|$|It {{was finally}} {{determined}} that the engine being mounted in the rear caused too many unfavourable handling characteristics in an offroad vehicle, and the LMA002 was built with an entirely new chassis, moving the engine (now the V12 out of the Lamborghini Countach) to the front. After much testing and altering of the prototype, it was finally given a serial number {{and became the first}} LM002. The production model was unveiled at the Brussels Auto Show in 1986. It was dubbed the [...] "Rambo-Lambo". [...] Civilian models were outfitted with a full luxury package, including full leather trim, tinted power windows, air conditioning, and a premium stereo mounted in a roof console. In order to meet the vehicle's tire needs, Lamborghini commissioned Pirelli to create the Pirelli Scorpion tires with custom, run-flat <b>tread</b> <b>designs.</b> These were made specifically for the LM and were offered in two different <b>tread</b> <b>designs,</b> one for mixed use and the other for sand use only. These tires could be run virtually flat without risk and could handle the desert heat, the loading, and the speeds of the LM. The LM002 was fitted with a 290-litre fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|Various tyres {{have been}} made {{available}} by different mountainboard manufacturers, giving riders a choice of tire specifications.

There is a variety of tread patterns available, ranging from street slicks to deep <b>tread</b> <b>designed</b> for maximum grip with split center beads to channel water away. Width and diameter is also variable.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded as High-Tec Retreading in Colorado in 1981 by Rick Hawkins. He grew it {{as a family}} {{business}} with his sons Joel and Rick Jr. For years they focused on fleet and delivery vehicles like mail trucks.

5000|$|As {{is often}} the case, there are compromises. Winter tires, and [...] "mud and snow" [...] tires, may have {{thousands}} of sipes and give good traction. But, they may feel [...] "squirmy" [...] on a warm, dry road. Unpatterned racing [...] "slicks" [...] on dry roads give maximum traction. These have no sipes, no grooves, and no tread blocks. They also have very poor traction however on even slightly wet surfaces. Tire manufacturers use different tread rubber compounds and <b>tread</b> <b>designs</b> for different tires' usages.|$|R
50|$|Source {{control in}} roadway noise has {{provided}} little reduction in vehicle noise, {{except for the}} development of the hybrid vehicle; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets. Highway noise is today less affected by motor type, since the effects in higher speed are aerodynamic and tire noise related. Other contributions to reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire <b>tread</b> <b>designs</b> for trucks in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of unmuffled vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The rough {{wearing surface}} of the chipseal generates more roadway noise at any {{operating}} speed than do typical asphalt or concrete surfaces.

50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} moulded tyre <b>tread</b> <b>design,</b> {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little {{theoretical}} background to this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show displayed a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of <b>tread</b> <b>design</b> or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such square-edged tread blocks wore badly and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In general, when {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} a sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> pattern <b>design</b> on the noise generated, the noise is measured by first carving the tires and then using expensive laboratory equipment to perform the measurements. The advantages of using this method are that the experimental results and the noise level produced from the tires (that go into mass production) feature minimal differences and that reliable tested data are produced. The disadvantages of this method are that molds must be created to produce slicks, and that substantial time is invested in the process of artificial carving and performing subsequent experiments, all of which increase the tire development time and cost. Therefore, {{the effect of a}} sedan vehicle’s tire <b>tread</b> pattern <b>design</b> on rolling noise was predicted in this study by employing the numerical calculation methods used in calculating fluid mechanics. The experimental results obtained by the Automotive Research & Testing Center (ARTC) were used to test the improved <b>tread</b> pattern <b>designs</b> to validate the reliability of the method proposed in this study and that the tire development time can be effectively shortene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This lecture {{provides}} a {{short history of}} agricultural tractors and wheel equipment. A list of basic tire terms {{used to describe the}} tire profile is covered, along with performance criteria used to match mechanical front drive axles to the rear axle for proper gearing. In addition, the RCI table is introduced to provide a visual example of how tires can be grouped by rolling circumference and overall diameter. A description of tire size designations is listed for bias, radial, and flotation sizing. The load rating designations for ply, star, and load index is also explained. The five most common <b>tread</b> <b>designs</b> for powered axles are defined, with examples of the different patterns. Two examples of the creation of new tire sizes are given: one for large, high-horsepower, four-wheel drive tractors, and one for high-capacity row crop sprayers.

50|$|Snow tires - Snow tires perform three functions: compaction, shear bonding and bearing. On roadways they compact {{the snow}} {{in front of them}} and provide a shear bond between the treads and the {{compacted}} snow. Off-road, they also provide bearing on the compacted snow. The bearing contact must be low enough for the tires not to sink too deeply for forward progress to become impeded by compacting {{the snow in}} front of them. <b>Tread</b> <b>design</b> is critical to snow tires used on roads and represent a tradeoff between on-snow traction and dry and wet-road comfort and handling.|$|E
40|$|Autonomous mobile robots, {{which can}} be {{programmed}} to exhibit cooperative behaviors, are ideal mechanisms for sweeping land mines. They can spread out to hunt for the mines, using a dispersal rule. Once a mine is located, they can congregate to surround it using a clustering rule.

UALR has been experimenting with coupled oscillator based rule generators for several years using fragile, indoor robots in a laboratory setting to validate the clustering and dispersal behaviors.

40|$|To produce thin grooves in {{the tread}} portion of tires, tire molds contain a {{multitude}} of sipes, which are thin metal inserts that project into the tread rubber during molding and curing.
