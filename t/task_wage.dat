40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather basic data and measure job {{satisfaction}} and job engagement of dietitians and nutrition teachers in Chungbuk area. This study was conducted on 20 August, 2010. Out of 336 questionnaires, 266 were completed and made available for the purpose of statistical evaluation. As the main results, job satisfaction was classified into eight categories: <b>task,</b> <b>wage,</b> policies related to tasks, professional growth, promotion, relationships with colleagues, working environment, and supervision. In the case of wage, promotion, and policies related to tasks, the average scores of job satisfaction were around 2 points out of 5. Dietitians ' job satisfaction levels according to employment type and school type significantly differed. In terms of job involvement and organizational commitment, average scores were 3. 53 points and 3. 12 points respectively. The survey showed significantly different results for job involvement and organizational commitment, depending on employment type, school type, and status as chef in charge or trainee. Dietitians working in elementary schools, as chef in charge, or with permanent employment showed higher job involvement and organizational commitment. Furthermore, there was a significantly positive correla-tion between factors such as <b>task,</b> <b>wage,</b> promotion, relationships with colleagues, supervision, work environment...|$|E

We offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the causal links between human capital endowments, occupational assignment, job <b>tasks,</b> and <b>wages,</b> which motivate a Roy model of the allocation of workers to occupations.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{household}} behavior to explore the complex interactions between the decision-making process within the household and social norms. The household is viewed as two separate spheres – the female and the male – both linked by a public good and a "conjugal contract" trough which spouses exchange resources. The conjugal contract negotiated within the couple is partly influenced by social norms given the conformism of individuals. Social norms are endogenously determined as the average conjugal contract. We find that the closer spouses' wages are in the labor market, the more equally they share household <b>tasks.</b> <b>Wage</b> policies promoting gender wage equality lead all couples to renegotiate the terms of their conjugal contract, which in turn changes social norms. Even though spouses aim at maximizing the household's welfare, the resulting equilibrium allocation is not Pareto efficient and inefficiency increases with social conformism.

5000|$|Very {{few women}} held any power — some queens did, {{as did the}} heads of Catholic convents. In the Enlightenment, the {{writings}} of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau gave a political program for reform of the Ancien Régime, founded on a reform of domestic mores. Rousseau's conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more unified than that found in modern sociology. Rousseau argued that the domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a [...] "modern" [...] society. Within early modern society, women of urban artisanal classes participated {{in a range of}} public activities and also shared work settings with men (even though they were generally disadvantaged in terms of <b>tasks,</b> <b>wages</b> and access to property.)Salic law prohibited women from rule; however, the laws for the case of a regency, when the king was too young to govern by himself, brought the queen into the center of power. The queen could assure the passage of power from one king to another — from her late husband to her young son—while simultaneously assuring the continuity of the dynasty.|$|R

This was done using a unique web-based dataset {{that allowed the}} measurement of the task implementation intensity {{at the individual level}} (10 occupation-specific tasks across hundreds of occupations and thousands of individuals) for the Dutch labour market. Previous research that used various theoretical and analytical approaches explained a consistent amount of wage differences for similar workers, but left part of it unexplained. We have shown that a better understanding of wage heterogeneity among similar workers can be achieved by implementing a task approach.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{endogenous}} offshoring on cost-efficiency, wages and unemployment in a task assignment model with skill heterogeneity. Exact conditions for the following insights are derived. The distributional effect of offshoring (high-) low-skill-intensive tasks is similar to (unskilled-) skill-biased technology changes, while offshoring medium-skill-intensive <b>tasks</b> induces <b>wage</b> polarization. Offshoring improves cost-efficiency through international task reallocation and puts a downward pressure on all wages through domestic skill-task reallocation. If elasticities of task substitution are low (high), the downward pressure on wages in neighbouring skill segments is low (high) with a net effect of higher (lower) wages and employment...|$|R

Job tasks vary substantially within and between occupations, are significantly related to workers' characteristics, and are robustly predictive of wage differentials both between occupations and among workers in the same occupation. We offer a conceptual framework that makes explicit the causal links between human capital endowments, occupational assignment, job <b>tasks,</b> and <b>wages.</b> This framework motivates a Roy (1951) model of the allocation of workers to occupations. Tests of the model’s implication that 'returns to tasks' must negatively covary among occupations are strongly supported. ...|$|R
50|$|Around 730, {{two factors}} {{led to a}} change in Umayyad policy towards Georgia. First, in that year, the Khazars managed to invade Northwestern Iran and {{went all the way to}} Mosul before being defeated. The {{tributary}} buffer states of the Caucasus had not been able to prevent that invasion. Furthermore, local Christian rulers, such as Guaram III of Iberia still kept contact with Byzantium and hoped for its intervention. The Empire however was weak and Arab raids could reach Constantinople, making the Byzantines less of a menace than the Khazars. In 732-733, caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik appointed Marwan ibn Muhammad governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the <b>task</b> of <b>waging</b> war against the Khazars and subduing Georgia.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between technological complexity and wage inequality. We present an efficiency wage model that adopts Kremer's (1993) O-ring production function. The model has two main implications: (i) when the production process becomes more complex, within-task wage differences will increase between plants, and (ii) between-task wage differences will increase within plants. We study these implications empirically using Finnish metal industry data that provide quantified information on {{the complexity of the}} tasks. We find that wages increase in all the tasks with the complexity of the production process. Furthermore, the relationship between the complexity of the <b>tasks</b> and <b>wages</b> is steepest in the firms with more complex production processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the labour supply of Australian aged care workers to determine methods for increasing supply to remedy possible shortages in the workforce. The possibility of increasing supply is tested through examination of descriptive statistics and estimations of labour supply models. The {{findings show that}} supply could be increased by removing impediments to adjustment of workers' hours and by decreasing paperwork requirements to allow more work hours for direct caring <b>tasks.</b> The <b>wage</b> elasticity of supply for existing workers {{is found to be}} negative for each direct care occupation, even with a measure of labour supply that takes into account desired hours of work. This suggests that wage increases will not be effective in increasing supply of current workers and provides some evidence that aged care occupations have backward bending labour supply curves...|$|R

30|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{limitations}} and complementarities of existing literature and tapping into new web-sourced data possibilities, we addressed two objectives: to explore (a) whether within-occupation wage dispersion is related to differences in task implementation intensity and (b) whether cross-occupation wage dispersion {{is related to the}} level of task heterogeneity of occupations. For that purpose, we used three indexes of task implementation heterogeneity: variation ratio, entropy and the Gibbs index. Wage disparities were measured by two indexes: the Gini index and the frictional wage dispersion (FWD) index, which considers the median and the reservation wages in each occupation. In order to compare a priori similar workers, the wage heterogeneity indexes were computed on the individual's wage portion orthogonal to personal and firm productive characteristics. In addition, <b>task</b> and <b>wage</b> heterogeneity indexes were calculated and compared at occupational level.|$|R

During conquests, noyons used to receive territories for administration and they effectively became aristocracy, into the 20th century. Noyans were above the ordinary Mongols in social rank but below the descendants of Genghis and his brothers.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of a product variety model, this paper {{examines}} the impact of outsourcing of skill-intensive <b>tasks</b> on skilled–unskilled <b>wage</b> gap. Outsourcing affects the wage gap through direct as well as indirect channels. While outsourcing decreases the effective wage of skilled workers in the services sector, owing to inter-sectoral labour mobility, its overall impact on the equilibrium skilled wage is positive. Through an increase in the size of external economies in the industrial sector, outsourcing can reduce the unskilled wage. In overall terms, outsourcing of skill-intensive tasks increases the skilled–unskilled wage gap...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the context}} of a product variety model, this paper {{examines}} the impact of international outsourcing of some skill intensive <b>tasks</b> on <b>wage</b> inequality. We consider four possibilities: long-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are non-traded, long-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are traded, short-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are non-traded and short-run equilibrium where varieties of producer services are traded. It is shown that in each case, under certain conditions, international outsourcing can increase skilled-unskilled wage inequality. In the first three cases, outsourcing affects wage inequality directly as well as indirectly. In the short-run equilibrium, where varieties of producer services are traded, international outsourcing increases skilled-unskilled wage inequality only through an indirect channel. In the short-run equilibrium, where all goods are traded, the impact of outsourcing on wage inequality depends solely on the relative size of the income share of capital. Furthermore, in the long-run equilibrium, outsourcing increases the productivity of the industrial sector...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{framework}} with multiple worker types (e. g. gender, age, education) to decompose changes in aggregated and disaggregated measures of between-group inequality into changes in (i) {{the composition of the}} workforce across labor types, (ii) the importance of different tasks, (iii) the extent of computerization, and (iv) other labor-specific productivities (a residual to match observed relative wages). The model features three forms of comparative advantage: between worker types and equipment types, worker types and tasks, and equipment types and tasks. We parameterize the model to match observed changes in worker type allocations (across equipment types and <b>tasks)</b> and <b>wages</b> in the United States between 1984 and 2003. The combination of changes in the importance of tasks and computerization explains {{more than half of the}} rise in the skill premium and the rise in inequality across more disaggregated education types as well as almost half the rise in the relative wage of women...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries {{industry}} in India is an unorganized sector of occupation where considerable proportion of workers is female. However, the prevalent gender inequality {{in terms of}} <b>task</b> allocation, <b>wages,</b> and other welfare facilities makes the men as dominant workforce. Furthermore, there are occasions when incidents of workplace violence take place. The present {{study was conducted to}} find the prevalence of workplace violence at worksite and study gender bias in such events. In a cross-sectional study 171 fishermen and fisherwomen were interviewed to collect information about workplace violence. The overall prevalence of workplace violence reported was 14. 6 %. This included 2 (8 %) cases of physical assault, 1 (4 %) case of sexual harassment of fisherwoman by her colleague and 22 (88 %) cases of verbal abuse. A significant (p= 0. 002) association was found between gender and verbal abuse at the workplace. In conclusion, this study highlighted the occurrence of workplace violence among fishery workers in India. There was a gender bias towards females that can be attributed to male dominance in this occupation...|$|R
40|$|Occupations {{are central}} to the {{stratification}} system, including the stratification of wages. One compelling explanation for how occupations relate to the wage structure is through their task content. We consider the relationships between occupational <b>tasks</b> and the <b>wage</b> structure directly using unconditional quantile regression methods, examining a broader range of occupational tasks than normally considered. We find that occupational tasks have varied implications for the wage structure in ways not always consistent with dominant technology-based explanations. We conclude that the task-based approach to conceptualising how occupations determine the wage structure is a promising avenue for future research and outline some recommendations on how to proceed...|$|R
30|$|A related {{conceptual}} and empirical challenge concerns the {{appropriate use of}} <b>task</b> measures in <b>wage</b> regressions. A key implication of the theoretical framework above is that holding the task efficiencies (that is, the α(⋅)′s) constant, changes in {{the market value of}} tasks should affect the evolution of wages by skill group. In particular, the model predicts that if the relative market price of the tasks in which a skill group holds comparative advantage declines, the relative wage of that skill group should also decline—even if the group reallocates its labor to a different set of tasks (i.e., due to the change in its comparative advantage).|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of a technological change (the steam engine) on wage premiums. Using historical employer–employee panel data, we found that steam technology had both new skill-demanding and skill-replacing aspects. The former manifested itself as {{an increase in the}} demand for high-skilled engineers, the latter in a decline in the demand for intermediate-skilled, able-bodied seamen and an increase in the demand for unskilled engine room operators. Our panel data analysis, which controls for unobserved heterogeneity, implies that high-skilled labourers in abstract tasks and unskilled labourers in manual <b>tasks</b> improved their <b>wage</b> positions relative to intermediate-skilled labourers in routine tasks. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis of technology-based polarisation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} growth through industrialization, where machines replace labor in a growing set of tasks. While substituting labor in some tasks, machines complement labor in the remaining tasks by increasing its productivity. This dual role of capital leads to a feedback between technical progress and wages, the cost of labor. Higher wages induce creation and adoption of machines to replace costly labor, while these machines complement labor in the remaining <b>tasks</b> and raise <b>wages</b> further. This feedback fuels economic growth and can even lead to long-run growth. The model then analyzes possible triggers that can push a stagnant economy into growth, and suggests some possible events {{that have led to}} the industrial revolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on paid child care work/commodification of child care in {{informal}} labor market and aims to understand meaning of this commodification for child minders and work relation; place of emotions in work, features transferred from familial relations and their impacts; and influence of private sphere as a working place. This study is based on in-depth interviews conducted with 19 child minders {{in the capital city}} of Turkey, Ankara. Results displayed that in Turkey, due to lack of any formal regulations targeting the paid child care work, ambiguity that surrounds frame of the work increases the tension. Both child minders and mothers refrain from considering their connection with each other as employee and employer. Hence, they are inclined to think and behave via family terms. Unavailability of any kind of formal mechanism to bring standardization of definition of <b>tasks,</b> of <b>wages,</b> and of working relation causes a formless area. However, there are informally defined and adopted principles functioning in the field. Furthermore, because of fictive kinship relation and emotional component in the work, risk of exploitation is high. And despite inequality between mothers and child minders, both of the actors have their own negotiation power...|$|R
30|$|Lastly, columns (7) to (10) show fixed effects {{regressions}} explaining variation within broad occupational groups. The urban wage premia and {{the returns}} to match quality decrease when we include occupational fixed effects. Hence, the {{spatial distribution of}} occupations explains {{a substantial part of}} the spatial wage differences in the Netherlands. Columns (9) and (10) show substantial explanatory power of job tasks. As we control for additional cognitive and social job <b>tasks,</b> the spatial <b>wage</b> variation in the Netherlands becomes insignificant. This finding suggests that the spatial wage variation reflects different activities and not increasing returns to scale. Only the economic activity of workers explains spatial wage differences. The wage return of match quality remains significant but decreases to 9 percent of a standard deviation.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} service offshoring on the real wages of U.

The results from a Mincerian wage regression indicate that within skill groups, the impact of service offshoring on real wages depends on the task content of the respective occupation. The real wages of medium- and high-skilled workers employed in the least offshorable occupations were positively affected by service offshoring. However, within the groups of medium- and high-skilled workers, service offshoring negatively affected the real wage of the most tradable occupations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a framework {{to understand the}} role of interpersonal interactions {{in the labor market}} including <b>task</b> assignment and <b>wages.</b> Effective interpersonal interactions involve caring, to establish cooperation, {{and at the same time}} directness, to communicate in an unambiguous way. The ability to perform these tasks varies with personality and the importance of these tasks varies across jobs. An assignment model shows that people are most productive in jobs that match their style and earn less when they have to shift to other jobs. An oversupply of one attribute relative to the other reduces wages for people who are better with the attribute in greater supply.

30|$|A growing {{literature}} is now grappling with these challenges. A recent working paper by Firpo et al. (2011), for example, develops an innovative method {{for measuring the}} impact of changing <b>task</b> prices on <b>wage</b> structure. Using a simple statistical model of occupational wage setting, their work predicts that occupations that are specialized in tasks that have declining market value should see a reduction in both mean occupational wages and the variance of occupational wages, and vice versa for tasks with rising prices. This latter (variance) effect stems from the interaction between a falling task price and a fixed distribution of task efficiencies within an occupation; as {{the market value of}} a given task falls, the range of wages paid to workers with differing productivities in that task compresses along with it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general equilibrium assignment model of workers to tasks with endogenous supply of skills. The model has 2 key features. First, skills are endogenous and multidimensional. Second, {{two types of}} assignment occur; workers self-select the type of skills to supply and firms assign workers to tasks/machines. Equilibrium is characterized by two functions mapping skills of each type to <b>tasks</b> and two <b>wage</b> functions, one {{for each type of}} skills, so that the wage distributions generally overlap. The model shows that the impact of any given skill-biased technical change on wage inequality is tightly related to the distribution of skills in the population. Productivity effects can be over or under estimated by wage data when the supply of skills is endogenous. The model also shows that Johnson's (1997) distinction between intensive and extensive technical change is impossible when supply is endogenous...|$|R

This paper develops a framework to understand the role of interpersonal interactions {{in the labor market}} including <b>task</b> assignment and <b>wages.</b> Interactions between people are modeled as a trade-off between caring and directness, both of which can be either beneficial or detrimental. Caring is needed to establish cooperation; directness is needed to provide information in a non-evasive manner. An assignment model shows that people are most productive in jobs that match their style and earn less when they have to shift to other jobs. Estimates of the assignment model show that this negative effect results from an oversupply of one attribute relative to the other. In addition, evidence is presented indicating that higher levels of sociability at young ages are associated with assignment to jobs emphasizing interpersonal interactions. The returns to interpersonal {{interactions are}} consistent with the assignment model...|$|R
