5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last {{to go out in}} Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, {{on the night of the}} planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

25|$|Harley Quinn - Completely {{loyal to}} the Joker in her first appearances, even though he mistreats her. She starts to develop {{feelings}} for the Green Goblin, which is briefly hinted at when she accepts Goblin's offer <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> date for coffee {{at the end of}} After Hours. At the end of Happy Hour she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still pined for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E

Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing {{to go out with}} nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E

The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music.

Acknowledging that [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia", [...] "The Hound of the Baskervilles" [...] and [...] "The Final Problem" [...] are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, Gatiss explained, [...] "We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous [...]" [...] "There's the question of how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on. You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too."

500|$|Starting in November 1966, {{the band}} adopted an {{experimental}} attitude during recording sessions for the album. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, [...] "the Beatles were looking <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> limb, both musically and sonically... we were utilising {{a lot of}} tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques... limiters and... effects like flanging and ADT." [...] Their recording of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" [...] in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's [...] "She's Leaving Home" [...] was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as [...] " [...] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper—imperishable popular art of its time". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing {{with a host of}} celebrities. The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing [...] "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", wrote Gould. Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as [...] "the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded".|$|E
500|$|... "Mrs. California" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had {{the possibility of}} being a great episode of The Office, but that it did not live up to that possibility. He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bit of a limb here and say that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was {{a good example of how}} the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.|$|E
