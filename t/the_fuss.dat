5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. This gave the English crowds their first chance to see what all <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, hitting a few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes, and fans greeted him with ovations, even at arenas that historically jeered him like TD Garden in Boston and Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.

25|$|However <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> {{about the}} reprint {{was little more}} than a storm in a teacup. Far more important, in terms of publicising Wagner's anti-Jewish feelings, was his stream of essays and {{newspaper}} articles over the following years, up to and including that of his death in 1883, which directly or indirectly criticised Jewish individuals or the Jews as a whole. These coincided with the growth of antisemitism—in the sense of a movement to withdraw the civic rights extended to Jews during the 19th century, and particularly on the unification of Germany in 1870—as a significant force in German and Austrian politics. Antisemitic leaders indeed made approaches to Wagner requesting his support; although he never offered such support officially, neither did he dissociate himself from their policies.|$|E

Avildsen (future Academy Award-winning director of Rocky and The Karate Kid). The two collaborated for several years, making low-budget films including Joe and Cry Uncle! During this period, Kaufman also directed and starred in his second feature film, The Battle of Love's Return, which garnered positive reviews in publications such as The New York Times, wrote and produced the lesbian thriller Sugar Cookies (with Oliver Stone), and wrote and directed another film, the Israeli comedy flop Big Gus, What's <b>the</b> <b>Fuss?.</b> Kaufman also served as executive in charge of locations for Saturday Night Fever, and was influential in choosing 2001 Odyssey as the nightclub in the film.|$|E

Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it to find out what <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what all <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E

The game was particularly praised for retaining the popular RTS gameplay from StarCraft, while introducing new features and improved storytelling. GamesRadar felt that [...] "in many ways, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty feels like StarCraft 2.0 – and that’s a good thing", stating that it [...] "delivers on all fronts". NZGamer.com said {{the game was}} [...] "the best RTS game released in years {{and one of the}} best games on PC". In relation to its story, GameTrailers stated, [...] "If there's anything immediately apparent from Wings of Liberty's story, it's that the series' narrative structure has evolved well beyond the original's sparse between-sortie intermissions," [...] calling it [...] "an epic and entertainingly told yarn", while Eurogamer criticized the dialogue as being [...] "flat" [...] and the characters as being [...] "either clichéd, banal or both". Giant Bomb echoed this view while also noting the Hyperion portion between missions, finding it to have [...] "more depth of character, more believable pathos, more surprise twists—than I honestly expected out of the story".

Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up.

500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E
