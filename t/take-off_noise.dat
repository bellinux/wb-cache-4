40|$|AbstractThe closer {{proximity}} between {{airports and}} residential areas {{has created a}} growing attention regarding noise pollution. The noise abatement procedures established by the aeronautical authorities and the models for computing noise contours around airports are proof of that. There are also models for identifying aircraft taking off which {{have focused on the}} correlation between the aircraft position and the noise signal. However, this correlation has been made so far without spatial information. The present study proposes a method to estimate the geo-referenced flight path followed by an aircraft taking off, using the spatio-temporal information extracted from the noise signal and improved with a smoothing algorithm. A microphone array with twelve sensors is used in order to evaluate different sensor spacings and the spatial aliasing effect when working with <b>take-off</b> <b>noise</b> signals. The flight path estimation method assumes that the aircraft is following a ground track collinear to the runway and was compared against radar information and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data.

This presentation excerpts results of the recent NASA subsonic Engine Concept Study for an Advanced Single Aisle Transport to demonstrate an affordability evaluation of performance characteristics and the subsequent impacts on engine architecture decisions.

40|$|Noise {{emission}} of a 9 x 7 and 8 x 8 open rotor configuration in cruise and in take-off conditions is examined by 3 D unsteady numerical simulations utilising the chimera method to represent rotor movement. The acoustic analysis {{has been carried}} out with a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings code over one rotor revolution with a resolution of 360 time steps. To ensure covering of all sources while keeping numerical losses low different hull surfaces have been examined. The comparison of two configurations at differ-ent flight conditions shows two main noise generating effects: the single rotor emission and emission caused by interaction of the rotors. The single rotor emission can mostly be seen in the rotor plane whereas the interaction can be examined at an angle of 20 to 45 and 135 to 155 degrees to the rotating axis with approx-imately the same share of total <b>noise</b> in <b>take-off</b> conditions. In cruise conditions the single rotor emission prevails over the in-teraction. This {{can be explained by the}} transonic blade tip speeds during cruise. Due to the reduced tip speeds in <b>take-off</b> interac-tion <b>noise</b> contributes to the total noise with a higher share than in cruise conditions.

Therefore {{it is necessary to}} reduce the noise emission of aircrafts. During <b>take-off,</b> the <b>noise</b> generated by the jet engines is dominating. One way to lower the noise emission of jet engines is to build an absorption silencer by using porous liners. Because of the high thermic and corrosive attacks as well as high fatigue loads, conventional absorbers cannot be used. A promising material is sintered metal fibre felts. This study investigates the suitability of metal fibre felts for the use as absorption material in silencers. The influences of pore morphology, absorption coefficient, determined with perpendicular sound incidence, as well as geometric parameters of the silencer to the damping are identified. To characterise the material, the parameters fibre diameter, porosity and thickness are determined using three-dimensional computer tomography images. The damping potential of absorption silencers is measured using an impedance tube, which was modified for transmission measurements. The essential parameter to describe the acoustic characteristics of porous materials is the flow resistivity. It depends on the size, shape and number of open pores in the material. Finally a connection between pore morphology, flow resistivity of the metal fibre felts and damping potential of the absorption silencer is given...|$|R
40|$|Animals often form {{groups to}} {{increase}} collective vigilance and allow {{early detection of}} predators, but this benefit of sociality relies on rapid transfer of information. Among birds, alarm calls are not present in all species, while other proposed mechanisms of information transfer are inefficient. We tested whether wing sounds can encode reliable information on danger. Individuals taking off in alarm fly more quickly or ascend more steeply, so may produce different sounds in alarmed than in routine flight, which then act as reliable cues of alarm, or honest ‘index’ signals in which a signal's meaning is associated with its method of production. We show that crested pigeons, Ocyphaps lophotes, which have modified flight feathers, produce distinct wing ‘whistles’ in alarmed flight, and that individuals take off in alarm only after playback of alarmed whistles. Furthermore, amplitude-manipulated playbacks showed that response depends on whistle structure, such as tempo, not simply amplitude. We {{believe this is the}} first demonstration that flight noise can send information about alarm, and suggest that <b>take-off</b> <b>noise</b> could provide a cue of alarm in many flocking species, with feather modification evolving specifically to signal alarm in some.

40|$|In this thesis, a new {{approach}} to the selection of key fan design parameters is presented and a methodology to optimise engine operation for minimum <b>take-off</b> <b>noise</b> is developed. These techniques are applied to the detailed design of a fan system for the Cambridge-MIT Silent Aircraft Initiative engine to which ultra low noise is the principle design objective. Reduction of jet mixing noise is identified as being crucial to the design process leading to jet area at take-off having to be increased significantly compared to current trends. Whilst increasing the number of engines from two to three and optimisation of the departure profile reduced this area increase, the introduction of variable cycle technology is required in order to deliver low cruise fuel burn. A variable area nozzle, identified as the most promising technology, is linked to operation of the fan through a simple model. This is used to show {{that it is possible to}} enable large increases in exit nozzle area at take-off without compromising fan performance at cruise. For the fan design, stage loading is shown to be a critical parameter as it impacts competing requirements. Increasing loading increases efficiency and part speed capacity but makes designing fixed outlet guide vanes harder. The method to optimise the departure profile was combined with the completed fan design and extended to include fan and airframe noise sources. The results of this show that by modifying the nozzle area at all times during take-off to maximise mass flow rate, the final podded SAI design is estimated to have a noise footprint of approximately 65. 5 dBA outside the baseline airport at take-off. This leads to an ICAO take-off certification noise level of approximately 73 EPNdB at both flyover and sideline, 23 dB below existing requirements at each measuring location.

40|$|Propulsion {{airframe}} aeroacoustic (PAA) interactions arise due to {{the manner}} in which an engine is installed on the airframe and lead to an asymmetry in the flow/acoustic environment, for example, for under-the-wing installations {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and the high-lift devices. In this work we study how we can affect these PAA interactions to reduce the overall jet-related installed noise by tailoring the chevron shapes on fan and core nozzles in a unique fashion {{to take advantage of this}} asymmetry. In part 1 of this trio of papers we introduced the concept of azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) and showed how some types of AVCs can be more beneficial than the conventional chevrons when tested on "isolated" scaled nozzles inclusive of the pylon effect. In this paper, we continue to study the effect of installing these AVC nozzles under a typical scaled modern wing with high-lift devices placed in a free jet. The noise benefits of these installed nozzles, as well as their installation effects are systematically studied for several fan/core AVC combinations at typical take-off conditions with high bypass ratio. We show, for example, that the top-enhanced mixing T-fan AVC nozzle (with enhanced mixing near the pylon and less mixing away from it) when combined with conventional chevrons on the core nozzle is quieter than conventional chevrons on both nozzles, and hardly produces any high-frequency lift, just as in the isolated case; however, its installed nozzle benefit is less than its isolated nozzle benefit. This suppression of <b>take-off</b> <b>noise</b> benefit under installed conditions, compared to its isolated nozzle benefit, is seen for all other chevron nozzles.

Blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise from four, 6 degree descent conditions are investigated with descents flown at 80 knot true and indicated airspeed, {{as well as}} 4400 and 3915 pound <b>take-off</b> weights. BVI <b>noise</b> is extracted from the acquired acoustic signals {{by way of a}} previously developed time-frequency analysis technique. The BVI extraction technique is shown to provide a better localization of BVI noise, compared to the standard Fourier transform integration method. Using this technique, it was discovered that large changes in BVI noise amplitude occurred due to changes in vehicle gross weight. Changes in BVI noise amplitude were too large to be due solely to changes in the vortex strength caused by varying vehicle weight. Instead, it is suggested that vehicle weight modifies the tip-path-plane angle of attack, as well as induced inflow, resulting in large variations of BVI noise. It was also shown that defining flight conditions by true airspeed, rather than indicated airspeed, provides more consistent BVI noise signals.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The major source of aircraft <b>noise</b> at <b>take-off</b> is jet <b>noise.</b> If jet noise is not adequately addressed environmental impact concerns will constrain the planned growth of the air transport system. A considerable amount of research worldwide has therefore been aimed at identifying ways to reduce jet noise including development of a predictive tool that can estimate the noise generated by new nozzle designs. Current noise prediction techniques, however, still require the input of empirically calibrated noise source models and their performance is still inadequate. In addition, development of detailed noise source identification measurements and the associated {{understanding of how to}} control (and reduce) the noise at the source has been limited. The fundamental turbulence property which acts as the source of propagating noise in shear layers is the two-point space-time velocity correlation (Rijkl). Very few measurements exist for this property to guide model development. It is therefore the aim of the work reported in this thesis to provide new experimental data that helps identify the turbulence sources located within the shear layer of jets.

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is {{investigating}} aircraft noise prediction and noise reduction capabilities. The Parametric Aircraft Noise Analysis Module (PANAM) is a fast prediction tool by the DLR Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology to address overall aircraft noise. It was initially developed to (1) enable comparative design studies {{with respect to}} overall aircraft ground noise and to (2) indentify promising low-noise technologies at early aircraft design stages. A brief survey of available and established fast noise prediction codes is provided in order to rank and classify PANAM among existing tools. PANAM predicts aircraft noise generated during arbitrary 3 D approach and <b>take-off</b> flight procedures. <b>Noise</b> generation of an operating aircraft is determined by its design, the relative observer position, configuration settings, and operating condition along the flight path. Feasible noise analysis requires a detailed simulation of all these dominating effects. Major aircraft noise components are simulated with individual models and interactions are neglected. Each component is simulated with a separate semi-empirical and parametric noise source model. These models capture major physical effects and correlations yet allow for fast and accurate noise prediction. Sound propagation and convection effects are applied to the emitting noise source in order to transfer static emission into aircraft ground noise impact {{with respect to the}} actual flight operating conditions. Recent developments and process interfaces are presented and prediction results are compared with experimental data recorded during DLR flyover noise campaigns with an Airbus A 319 (2006), a VFW- 614 (2009), and a Boeing B 737 - 700 (2010). Overall, dominating airframe and engine noise sources are adequately modeled and overall aircraft ground noise levels can sufficiently be predicted.

40|$|NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Program (UEETP) is {{developing}} a suite of technology to enhance the performance of future aircraft propulsion systems. Areas of focus for this suite of technology include: Highly Loaded Turbomachinery, Emissions Reduction, Materials and Structures, Controls, and Propulsion-Airframe Integration. The two major goals of the UEETP are emissions reduction of both landing and take-off nitrogen oxides (LTO-NO(x)) and mission carbon dioxide (CO 2) through fuel burn reductions. The specific goals include a 70 percent reduction in the current LTO-NO(x) rule and an 8 percent reduction in mission CO 2 emissions. In order to gain insight into the potential applications and benefits of these technologies on future aircraft, a set of representative flight vehicles was selected for systems level conceptual studies. The Supersonic Business Jet (SBJ) {{is one of these}} vehicles. The particular SBJ considered in this study has a capacity of 6 passengers, cruise Mach Number of 2. 0, and a range of 4, 000 nautical miles. Without the current existence of an SBJ the study of this vehicle requires a two-phased approach. Initially, a hypothetical baseline SBJ is designed which utilizes only current state of the art technology. Finally, an advanced SBJ propulsion system is designed and optimized which incorporates the advanced technologies under development within the UEETP. System benefits are then evaluated and compared to the program and design requirements. Although the program goals are only concerned with LTO-NO(x) and CO 2 emissions, it is acknowledged that additional concerns for an SBJ include <b>take-off</b> <b>noise,</b> overland supersonic flight, and cruise NO(x) emissions at high altitudes. Propulsion system trade-offs in the conceptual design phase acknowledge these issues as well as the program goals.

40|$|At present, on the {{aviation}} market a need exists for lighter {{and more efficient}} aircraft than the ones dominating the airspace today. Beside the reduction in operating costs and air pollutants of these new generation aircraft, this reduction in fuel use can result in several advantages {{with respect to the}} performance of the aircraft like increased range, increased payload capacity, decreased of take-off field length and decreased <b>take-off</b> <b>noise.</b> The present thesis is an effort to contribute to this reduction of fuel use by performing a gradient-based aerostructural wing optimization of a modern high-speed transport aircraft, the Airbus A 320, for minimal necessary fuel weight while maintaining its range specification. The novelty of this work is the use of the Individual Discipline Feasible (IDF) architecture instead of the traditional Multidisciplinary Feasible architecture. Using the IDF approach the disciplines within the aerostructural optimization are completely decoupled. The consistency of the system as a whole is maintained by the use of equality constraints to equate the output of one discipline to the input of another. No coupled sensitivity information is required because of this decoupled system. This makes the system not only simpler, but also provides more freedom in software choice for the disciplinary analyses. Furthermore, the time to perform optimization is reduced as the work of making the system consistent is removed from the computationally expensive individual disciplines {{and put it in the}} hands of the cheap optimization algorithm. The CFD solver SU 2 is used within the aerodynamic discipline to deform the grid, calculate the flow properties and gain sensitivities of lift and drag with respect to surface perturbations of the wing. The Euler model is used and the viscous drag component is calculated using a separate estimation. For the structural discipline the FEMWET software is used, providing the structural data including the static aeroelastic deformation of the wing. The optimization design variables are selected to be the angle of attack, the exterior shape of the wing, being the airfoil and planform shapes, and the thicknesses of the equivalent panels representing the internal wing box. The problem is constraint by compression, tension, shear, buckling and fatigue failure modes. Moreover it is constraint by a minimum aileron effectiveness and a maximum wing loading. The aerodynamic analysis is performed under cruise conditions while the wing structure is analyzed under the critical load cases of the reference aircraft. The optimization algorithm chosen is the Sparse Nonlinear Optimizer, based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming optimization algorithm. The optimization resulted in a reduction of the aircraft fuel weight of 11 %. This has been achieved by reducing induced drag through an increase in span and an improved lift distribution, by reducing wave drag by improved airfoil shapes and by reducing wing structural weight by a reduction in wing sweep.

40|$|Prediction of Supersonic Fan Noise Generated by Turbofan Aircraft Engines was {{focussed}} {{on improving}} {{the capability of}} predicting supersonic fan noise from modern high-bypass-ratio turbofan aero-engines. The shift from single core jet engines to highbypass-ratio turbofan engines brought about {{a reduction in the}} overall aircraft engine noise principally by reducing the jet-broadband noise. However, this new design meant the size of the fan of a high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine, over subsequent years, has increased in diameter. This increase allowed for the speed of the tips of the fan blades to reach and exceed the speed of sound. At high power engine operation conditions, especially at <b>take-off</b> conditions, the <b>noise</b> levels observed from such engines is very high. A major component of this noise is the supersonic fan noise which is also referred to as buzz-saw noise. Shocks are produced at the fan blade tips at this high power engine operation condition. These shocks propagate upstream, against the inflow, following a helical path dictated by the rotation of the fan. The pressure field produced {{at the tip of the}} fan is represented as a series of shock waves and expansion waves. As this pressure field advances, it interacts with the incoming flow and acoustic treatment in the intake duct. The shocks in the pressure field are all unique and are of different amplitudes. This is because the fan blades, although manufactured to tight tolerances, are not perfectly alike. Also, the arrangement of these fan blades on the fan hub will also lead to unavoidable differences among the fan blades. These minute differences are reflected in the amplitudes of the shocks, making each shock slightly different from the others. Shocks in the pressure field propagate with respect to the magnitude of their pressure amplitude. Therefore, the shocks travel at different speeds. In the course of propagation, faster shocks catch up with slower ones, and they merge into a single shock, even as the shocks’ amplitudes are attenuated. The difference in speeds and the interactions among the shocks ensure a transfer of energy among the harmonics of the pressure field. This process is nonlinear; the work in this thesis is focussed on modelling the nonlinear propagation of the shocks pressure pattern. These interactions greatly enhance the lower frequency harmonics of the pressure field shifting the dominance from the blade passage frequency and its harmonics. Further upstream, the dominance of the low frequency harmonics is unmistakable. Subsequently the pressure field is radiated from the aircraft intake duct. The resultant radiated pressure field is that which is perceived by an observer in the far-field. The models presented in this thesis capture the main features of this nonlinear propagation and radiation of the pressure field generated at the fan blade tips, and generates predictions for supersonic fan noise levels in the intake duct and in the far-field. A time domain model named SPRID (Sawtooth Propagation in Rigid Intake Ducts) developed is presented. This model predicts the supersonic fan noise levels in ducts without any acoustic treatment, and has been validated against a benchmark frequency domain nonlinear propagation model (FDNS), and also measured data from a modelscale fan rig test provided by Rolls-Royce PLC. The need to incorporate the effect of acoustic liners in the modelling led to the development of a new model which employs the combined time-frequency domain approach. In this model, the nonlinear propagation of the pressure field is simulated in the time domain, while the acoustic liner effects are implemented in the frequency domain. This model also has been validated with measured data. The combined time-frequency domain prediction method was improved to incorporate more complex features of supersonic fan noise propagation. Features such as the change in duct radius along the duct axis and the consequent change in mean flow speeds, and boundary layer effects on the liner absorption have been included in a more advanced model. The advanced nonlinear model is a more representative model of real aircraft intake duct. Also, a theoretical radiation model (GX-Munt) was utilized to predict supersonic fan noise in the far-field. In this thesis, a whole study of supersonic fan noise, starting from source generation at the fan plane up to the radiation to the farfield is presented. The thesis includes an extensive literature review, research on the generation of a source sawtooth for propagation utilizing measured data, and development of equations for nonlinear propagation in axisymmetric intake ducts. Results of the parametric studies using the advanced nonlinear propagation model reliably show all the effects of nonlinear distortion of the shock waves, variation in intake geometry, flow speeds, and variations in the acoustic liner absorption as a consequence of changes in boundary-layer thickness. Comparisons made against measured data, from modelscale fan rig tests conducted by Rolls-Royce PLC, show good and reasonable agreement. The advanced nonlinear propagation model achieves improved prediction capability for supersonic fan noise...|$|R
