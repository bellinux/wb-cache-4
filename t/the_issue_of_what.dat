5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law.

25|$|Another {{reason for}} the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their {{position}} on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin {{even if it is}} not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.|$|E

500|$|The 1873 act {{eliminated}} the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion {{to have their}} metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. [...] As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. [...] Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more {{on the open market}} in the United States until 1963. [...] Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that [...] "free silver" [...] or bimetallism would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. [...] Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 Bland–Allison Act required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. [...] The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, which {{came to be known as}} the Morgan dollar.

We introduce the term counter-assurance to describe methods and techniques used to defeat or subvert the protective and defensive measures that are put in place to assure information on information systems. It is our contention that teaching counter-assurance methods and techniques is ethically permissible. Mostly, we make a case for the moral justification of these teaching methods provided certain safeguards are in place...|$|R
