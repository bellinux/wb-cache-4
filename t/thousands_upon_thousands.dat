Their enduring following, described as [...] "cult-like", is notable in that their fanbase and legacy have continuously remained strong throughout their entire career whereas other bands from the 2000s emo scene have faded into obscurity. They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, [...] "popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence."

40|$|International audienceVirtual machine (VM) {{placement}} {{problem has been}} active research area over the past decade. The research community needs an open simulation framework that can accurately and scalably simulate virtual machine operations including live migrations. However, existing cloud simulation frameworks cannot reproduce live migration behaviors correctly. A naive migration model, not considering memory update operations nor resource sharing contention, can drastically underestimate the duration of a live migration {{and the size of}} migration traffic. In this paper, we propose a simulation framework of virtualized distributed systems with the first class support of live migration operations. We developed a resource share calculation mechanism for VMs and a live migration model implementing the precopy migration algorithm of Qemu/KVM. We extended a widely-used simulation toolkits, SimGrid, which allows users to simulate large-scale distributed systems by using user friendly programming API. Through experiments, we confirmed that our simulation framework correctly reproduced live migration behaviors of the real world under various conditions. Through a first use case, we also confirmed {{that it is possible to}} conduct large scale simulations of complex virtualized workloads <b>upon</b> hundred <b>thousands</b> of VMs <b>upon</b> <b>thousands</b> of physical machines (PMs) ...|$|R

The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled.

2500|$|Informal logic as a {{distinguished}} enterprise under this name emerged roughly {{in the late}} 1970s as a sub-field of philosophy. The naming of the field was preceded {{by the appearance of}} a number of textbooks that rejected the symbolic approach to logic on pedagogical grounds as inappropriate and unhelpful for introductory textbooks on logic for a general audience, for example Howard Kahane's Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric, subtitled [...] "The Use of Reason in Everyday Life", first published in 1971. Kahane's textbook was described on the notice of his death in the Proceedings And Addresses of the American Philosophical Association (2002) as [...] "a text in informal logic, [...] was intended to enable students to cope with the misleading rhetoric one frequently finds in the media and in political discourse.

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 1793, France {{declared}} war on Great Britain. The white planters in Saint Domingue, unhappy with Sonthonax made agreements with Great Britain to declare British sovereignty over the colony, believing that the British would maintain slavery. The British Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger believed {{that the success of}} the slave revolt in Saint Domigue would inspire slave revolts in the British Caribbean colonies and that taking Saint Domingue, the richest of the French colonies would be a most useful bargaining chip to have when the peace negotiations began to end the war, and the interim, occupying Saint Domingue would mean bringing all of its great wealth into the British treasury. The American journalist James Perry noted that the great irony of the British campaign in Haiti was instead of being the great money-spinner as expected, the campaign ended in a complete debacle that cost the British treasury millions of pounds and the British military <b>thousands</b> <b>upon</b> <b>thousands</b> of dead, all for nothing. Spain, who controlled the rest of the island of Hispaniola, would also join the conflict and fight with Great Britain against France. The Spanish forces invaded Saint Domingue and were joined by the slave forces. For most of the conflict, the British and Spanish supplied the rebels with food, ammunition, arms, medicine, naval support, and military advisors. By August 1793, there were only 3,500 French soldiers on the island. On 20 September 1793, about 600 British soldiers from Jamaica landed at Jérémie to be greeted with shouts of [...] "Vivent les Anglais! from the French population. On 22 September 1793, Mole St. Nicolas, the main French naval base in Saint Domingue surrendered to the Royal Navy peacefully. Everywhere, the British went, they restored slavery, which made them especially hated by the Haitians. To prevent military disaster, and secure the colony for republican France as opposed to Britain, Spain, and French royalists, separately or in combination, the French commissioners Léger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel freed the slaves in St. Domingue.|$|E
