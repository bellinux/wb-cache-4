5|$|Claus and Lavie are {{initially}} {{treated as}} intruders but eventually befriend {{the crew of}} the Silvana. They learn that the Guild intends to capture Alvis for reasons unknown <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first battle between the Silvana and Guild forces, Guild member Dio Eraclea takes an interest in Claus's flying skills and his signature move, the Immelmann turn. Wanting to learn more about Claus, Dio willingly allows himself to be captured. He reveals to the Silvana's captain, Alex Row, the existence of one of four Mysteria which act as a key to something known as Exile.|$|E

Other street foods include, dahi bhale (deep fried vadas in creamy yoghurt), gol gappay (fried round puri filled with vegetables and topped with tamarind chutney) and vegetable or chicken pakoras. Biryani and murgh pilao rice are a speciality in Faisalabad.|$|E

5|$|By {{the year}} 737, Emperor Xuanzong {{discarded}} {{the policy of}} conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending {{them out to the}} frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corvée labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 John's elder brothers, {{backed by}} Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the {{short-lived}} rebellion of 1173 to 1174. Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey {{to join their}} brother Henry in Paris. Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peace settlement agreed at Montlouis. Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights, Richard was given Aquitaine back, and Geoffrey was {{allowed to return to}} Brittany; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it {{claims to have}} one of the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|These ongoing {{victories}} belied {{the changing}} conditions applicable to Levants hunt for enemy vessels off Gibraltar. American vessels had become scarce, especially since Spain had closed her ports <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1777 {{in retaliation for}} privateer attacks on Spanish ships. French trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by Gibraltar's small Royal Navy squadron. Levant was careened on a beach at Gibraltar over Christmas 1778 {{and then returned to}} sea, but her next capture was not until 14 March 1779 when in company with Captain Rich's Enterprise she seized a French vessel, Thésée. A further victory followed on 1 April when Levant, still in company with Enterprise, took Eclair, a French xebec carrying wine and brandy from Marseilles.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1836, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery {{recounted the}} {{appearance}} of Jesus <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kirtland Temple, and his acceptance of the building as his house. This was followed by {{the appearance of}} three Old Testament prophets: Moses, Elias, and Elijah, each of whom bestowed additional temple-related authority on the two men.|$|E
25|$|Some mystics {{are said}} {{to have been able to}} perform miracles. But for many mystics, the miracles {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, one common form of mystical miracle, especially for women, was the Eucharistic miracle, such as being able to eat nothing other than the communion host. Catherine of Genoa was an example of someone who experienced this type of miracle.|$|E

25|$|The {{finding of}} good Gold in the Mines could {{sometimes}} cause the Club to renege on their obligations.

They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local press, but they never came back until 1910.|$|E
25|$|The American Colonization Society {{was active}} from late 1816 {{to the end}} of the Civil War, their goal being the {{establishment}} of an African republic where former slaves could experience a freedom not available <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. There were other reasons also for expatriation, as freedmen in the slave states were seen as disruptive to the slave system. Even among some abolitionists in the north freedman were seen as incompatible to their vision of American society.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} police departments has generated some controversy because such access is not typically given to traditional local news media. Moreover, {{the show has}} been criticized for putting witnesses in danger by revealing their faces and their voices on a nationally televised program and for not being sensitive to what might happen <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of retaliation. In response to such criticism, witnesses often ask producers to have their faces blurred out and voices changed or to speak off camera.|$|E
