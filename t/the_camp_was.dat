5|$|At {{that time}} the reorganized Lithuanians {{returned}} to the battle, attacking von Jungingen from the rear. The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry. As von Jungingen attempted {{to break through the}} Lithuanian lines, he was killed. According to Cronica conflictus, Dobiesław of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master's neck, while Długosz presented Mszczuj of Skrzynno as the killer. Surrounded and leaderless, the Teutonic Knights began to retreat. Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp. This move backfired when the camp followers turned against their masters and joined the manhunt. The knights attempted to build a wagon fort: <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification. However, the defense was soon broken and <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> ravaged. According to Cronica conflictus, more Knights died there than on the battlefield. The battle lasted for about ten hours.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1992, Vulliamy, Independent Television News (ITN) {{reporter}} Penny Marshall, and Channel 4 News reporter Ian Williams gained {{access to}} the Omarska camp. Their reporting served {{as one of the}} catalysts of a UN effort to investigate war crimes committed in the conflict. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> closed {{less than a month after}} its exposure caused international uproar.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus {{was sent}} to Stalag Luft III, a prisoner-of-war camp near Sagan that housed {{captured}} air force servicemen during the Second World War. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> restructured several times {{in order to accommodate}} more POWs. It would eventually hold over 10,000 inmates. Marcinkus was the only known Lithuanian at the camp.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> closed {{immediately}} {{after a visit}} by foreign journalists in early August. On 6 or 7 August 1992, the detainees at Omarska were divided into groups and transported in buses to different destinations. About 1,500 people were transported on twenty buses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> {{closed on}} 21 August 1941, and the {{remaining}} Croat inmates were transferred to other NDH-controlled camps, while the remaining Serbs and Jews were murdered.

5|$|This {{operation}} consisted {{mainly of}} a series of marches from Carrefour de la Croix to Camp Bois-l'Évêque. The battalion arrived at Camp Bois de L' Eveque on 18 August 1918.

50|$|The {{conditions}} {{in many of}} <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> <b>were</b> cruel. Responsibility in <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> <b>was</b> split up systematically, so that the individual German officer with responsibility in each camp could with {{a certain kind of}} justification declare himself not liable for the misery.

5000|$|April 1943: Part of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> {{turned into}} a {{hospital}} for POWs. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> separated and {{taken over by the}} SS to house Jews ostensibly for shipment overseas in exchange for German civilians.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} after Nelson's death, the state traded land for Nelson's estate, which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. The site {{is now known as}} the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District. After the land was {{converted}} to a park, but still unopen to the public, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> often vandalized. One of Nelson's tool sheds was burned down; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> closed, {{the site}} {{eventually}} {{returned to its}} original state. Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, {{with the exception of}} the two sentry posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the County of Inyo. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence Veterans of Foreign Wars, who used it as a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as a maintenance facility by the Inyo County Road Department.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

5|$|By {{now it was}} mid-August, {{more than}} three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho, a small steam tug that had {{assisted}} Emma during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was.</b> More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{was also}} the officer {{in charge of the}} {{liquidation}} of Szebnie concentration camp, which interned 4,000 Jewish and 1,500 Polish slave labourers. Evidence presented at Göth's trial indicates he delegated this task to a subordinate, SS-Hauptscharführer Josef Grzimek, who was sent to assist camp commandant SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Kellermann with mass killings. Between 21 September 1943 and 3February 1944 <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> gradually liquidated. Around a thousand of the victims were taken to the nearby forest and shot, and the remainder were sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately on arrival.|$|E
50|$|The Army {{had three}} {{reasons for the}} {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> two <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> to help escort wagon trains south into Indian Territory, where Indians loyal to the Confederacy attacked Union wagon trains. A second use for <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> <b>was</b> to be a place to send tired cavalry horses. The area west of <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> had much grass. The soldiers from <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> <b>were</b> needed to guard the horses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camp</b> Menominee <b>is</b> a boys' {{summer camp}} in Eagle River, Wisconsin, founded in 1928. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> focused {{primarily}} on sporting activities, although other options are available to campers. <b>The</b> <b>camp's</b> primary philosophy <b>is</b> to free campers from social pressures while emphasizing positive sportsmanship and other life skills. <b>Camp</b> Menominee <b>is</b> represented by the colors green and white, and is owned by Jason Feldgreber. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>is</b> certified by <b>the</b> American <b>Camp</b> Association's Wisconsin division.|$|R
5000|$|The camps: More {{than one}} <b>camps</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} to select students for IMO.

5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The Velepromet {{camp was}} a {{detention}} facility {{established in the}} final days of the Battle of Vukovar during the Croatian War of Independence. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> set up by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which shared control of the facility with Croatian Serb rebels. The facility, originally an industrial storage site, was located on the southern outskirts of the city of Vukovar, in close proximity to the JNA barracks. It consisted of eight warehouses surrounded by a wire fence, and was established on 16 November 1991, when the first detainees were brought there.|$|E

5|$|The duo was {{eventually}} smuggled into occupied Poland where they contacted the Polish Underground in Częstochowa {{and joined the}} guerrilla movement Armia Krajowa. Posing as a Polish laborer working in a jam factory, he served on patrols, raided food convoys, and assassinated members of the Gestapo during a probationary period. After <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> attacked in December, which not only killed several resistance members but also caused a split in the group, the reduced force continued its operations until February 1944, when retaliation for a raid on a police garrison lowered their membership to a critical point.|$|E
5|$|The first prisoners (30 German {{criminal}} prisoners {{from the}} Sachsenhausen concentration camp) arrived in May 1940, intended {{to act as}} functionaries within the prison system. The first mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp, which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in Tarnów, Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly, adjacent to the site, until <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>was</b> ready.|$|E
