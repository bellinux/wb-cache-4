25|$|To grow crops {{regularly}} in less-fertile areas, the soil must be turned to bring nutrients to the surface. A major advance for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> was the turnplough, {{also known as}} the mouldboard plough (UK), moldboard plow (US), or frame-plough. A coulter (or skeith) could be added to cut vertically into the ground just ahead of the share (in front of the frog), a wedge-shaped cutting edge at the bottom front of the mouldboard with the landside of the frame supporting the undershare (below-ground component).|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} limited {{empirical}} evidences {{on this subject}} in the EU. Vrolijk and Poppe (2008) analysed a very large samples <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> based on several EU countries. This allows for comparison among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> supporting the idea that farm income variability is generally high and that differences among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> exist: more specialised and small farms are often faced with relatively higher income variability. Agrosynergie (2011) found that variability appears on average high in specialist granivore and specialist field crops farms, while low in mixed farms. Furthermore, variability is higher in small than in large <b>farms</b> in most <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> and across regions (Agrosynergie 2011).|$|R

25|$|In {{shifting}} cultivation, a {{small area}} of a forest is cleared by cutting down all {{the trees and the}} area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.|$|E

40|$|All {{gradations}} {{in farming}} systems between cash grain production and large cattle feeding establishments {{are present in}} Cass and Otoe counties. Therefore, to facilitate {{a study of the}} various combinations, the farms are classified into <b>types.</b> Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> grain, general, and livestock, have been arranged with arbitrary limits so that a reasonably representative sample falls within each group. A preliminary phase of the study attempts to compare three methods <b>of</b> determining <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms.</b> Another phase deals with the extent of grain, general, and livestock farming in this area by groups of years similar in price level and production. An analysis is made to try to identify any significant shifting in <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> between groups <b>of</b> years. The third objective is an attempt to determine what relationships exist between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> size <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> and labor incomes. Finally the study includes an analysis <b>of</b> specialized <b>farms</b> within <b>types,</b> that is, those farms characterized by relatively heavy production of cattle, hogs, corn, or wheat. The source of the data consists <b>of</b> 827 <b>farm</b> account records from Cass and Otoe counties. The data cover the 12 year period from 1928 to 1939, inclusive. Advisor: N/...|$|R
