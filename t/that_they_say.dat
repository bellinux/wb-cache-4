The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{complexity}} and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations. Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science Lawrence M. Principe and William R. Newman, have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> are described in medieval and early modern texts. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian and Anna Marie Roos, who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he {{was familiar with the}} Japanese original. However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: [...] "I {{know for a fact that}} [...] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time." [...] He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is [...] "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas." [...] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, [...] "we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience.

[...] "I suggest to audiences <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it.

He left the church on October 19, 1838 with Thomas B. Marsh, the presiding member of the Twelve. Marsh explained the reasons for their dissent in an affidavit which he and Hyde signed on October 24, 1838 in Richmond, Missouri. These included their contention that the Mormons had organized into a company known as the Danites, [...] "who have taken an oath to support the heads of the church in all things <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> or do, whether right or wrong" [...] and that Mormon and Danite vigilantes had burned and looted non-Mormon settlements in Daviess County.

He was present at early Danite meetings and said that the Danites swore oaths [...] "to support the heads of the church in all things <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> or do, whether right or wrong." [...] The newly formed Danites disagreed initially on what steps to take against the dissenters, who had left the church but still lived nearby on land that had murky legal status. The properties had been purchased with a mixture of common and private funds, and in the name of both the LDS Church and private individuals. Reed Peck, another ex-Mormon, alleged that Carter and Dimick B. Huntington proposed that the group [...] "kill these men {{that they would not be}} capable of injuring the church."
