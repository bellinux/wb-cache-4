500|$|Because {{the results}} of {{calculations}} based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it could {{not lead to a}} successful weapon, while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. [...] Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer. To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible. [...] To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, MANIAC, at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. [...] Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. [...] Françoise Ulam was one of a cadre of women [...] "computers" [...] who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on mechanical calculators, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's slide rule. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. [...] The results showed that, in workable configurations, a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in Combinatorics to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering. [...] In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.|$|E
40|$|The Gamow peak {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} concepts in the study of <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> in stars. It is widely used in order to determine, at a given plasma temperature, the effective stellar energy region in which most charged-particle induced nuclear reactions occur. It is of importance in the design of nuclear astrophysics measurements, including those involving radioactive ion beams, and for the determination of stellar reaction rates. We demonstrate that the Gamow peak concept breaks down under certain conditions if a nuclear reaction proceeds through narrow resonances at elevated temperatures. It is shown that an effective stellar energy window does indeed exist in which most <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> take place at a given temperature, but that this energy window can differ significantly from the commonly used Gamow peak.

2500|$|The 62-ton Ivy Mike device {{built by}} the United States and {{exploded}} on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful [...] "hydrogen bomb" [...] or thermonuclear bomb. In this context, {{it was the first}} bomb in which most of the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated vacuum flask or cryostat, held cryogenic liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional atomic bomb (the [...] "primary") {{at one end of the}} bomb was used to create the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, he {{researched}} cosmic rays. In mid-1948 {{he participated}} in the Soviet atomic bomb project under Igor Kurchatov and Igor Tamm. Sakharov's study group at FIAN in 1948 {{came up with a}} second concept in August–September 1948. Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b> This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake. The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to Sarov in 1950, Sakharov {{played a key role in}} the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as Sakharov's Third Idea in Russia and the Teller-Ulam design in the United States. Before his Third Idea, Sakharov tried a [...] "layer cake" [...] of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel. The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb. However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller-Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called radiation implosion. The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Sakharov's idea was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50Mt Tsar Bomba of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>reaction.</b> (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E
