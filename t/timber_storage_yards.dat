40|$|Inbound and {{outbound}} containers are temporarily {{stored in}} the <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> at container terminals. A combination of container demand increase and <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> capacity scarcity create complex operational challenges for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> managers. This paper presents an in-depth overview of <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations, including the material handling equipment used, and highlights current industry trends and developments. A classification scheme for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations is proposed and used to classify scientific journal papers published between 2004 and 2012. The paper also discusses and challenges the current operational paradigms on <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations. Lastly, the paper identifies new avenues for academic research based on current trends and developments in the container terminal industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> management contains:determining the exact storage locations for the arriving blocks, and determining the storing or retrieving route for each block.

Container <b>storage</b> <b>yards</b> include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{organization}} of the import <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> at container port terminals. Three new stacking strategies are introduced which take into account the containersâ€™ arrival and departure rates and the <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> characteristics. A mathematical model based on probabilistic distribution functions is developed to estimate the number of rehandles required to manage an import container yard. The model is applied to the three proposed stacking strategies. Results show that the optimal strategy depends on stacking height and the relationship between vessel headway and container dwell time.
