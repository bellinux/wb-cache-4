40|$|The tube to {{tube sheet}} (TTS) welds of steam {{generator}} of Fast Breeder Reactor {{is the most}} critical joint. This is because, sodium flows on shell side and water on tube side. Any failure would thus be catastrophic. Microfocal radiography is an established technique {{that is being used}} for the evaluation of such welds. Using microfocal radiography pores of the order of 25 microns could be detected. Microfocal radiography of TTS joints is primarily accomplished using a backward <b>throw</b> <b>rod</b> anode. Such an arrangement however is beset with its own problems. The angled beam results in uneven beam intensity across the weld. During actual weld radiography, the trailing edge of the beam where intensity is minimum, traverses a longer distance than the leading edge which compounds the problem of density variation. This results in uneven radiographic density and contrast. It is a well-known fact that sensitivity achievable in radiography is a function of radiographic contrast and definition. Radiographic contrast in turn is affected by subject and film contrast. Uneven radiographic contrasts make interpretation complex and sometimes result in unacceptable density variations. To overcome this problem, the authors devised a novel solution. Using appropriately designed and fabricated filters and image processing techniques, authors have successfully developed procedures for ensuring uniformity i...|$|E

50|$|Deacon Litz was {{the fastest}} {{qualifier}} for the day, with {{a run of}} 105.755 mph. After two failed attempts, Rick Decker finally made the field, after he finished installation of the Hoosier Pete engine. Fred Roberts and Rollin May failed to complete their attempts. Roberts <b>threw</b> a <b>rod,</b> and May was too slow to meet the 80 mph minimum speed. Doc MacKenzie never made {{it out to the}} track, and Sam Greco <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> with only thirty minutes left in the day.|$|R
50|$|The P-38 was {{ill-equipped to}} deal with the extreme cold and high {{moisture}} conditions that prevailed at the operating altitudes of 20,000 to 33,000 feet over Northern Europe. A high number of group casualties resulted from engine failure at altitude. <b>Thrown</b> <b>rods,</b> engine explosions and unexpected power reduction during flight were all fatal flaws that the Axis aircraft exploited. The P-38 was equal to any German fighter at altitudes below 15,000 feet, but was usually at a disadvantage above that altitude.|$|R

50|$|Qualifying resumed on Wednesday May 22. Approximately 20,000 spectators saw five cars {{complete}} runs, and {{the field}} was filled to 14 cars. Mauri Rose, who <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> on his first attempts, returned Wednesday with a different engine, was the fastest car of the day.|$|R
50|$|Rain {{closed the}} track {{for nearly two}} hours, {{prompting}} officials to extend qualifying until 7:30 p.m. Still, only seven cars made runs, and only six were completed. Mauri Rose had a fast first lap that could have {{put him on the}} front row, but the engine <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> on lap two.|$|R

50|$|Also a {{surprise}} was Ralph Hepburn who qualified third. Hepburn took {{the outside of}} the front row with a run of 116.543 mph. Peter DePaolo's run was mostly a disappointment, as he managed only 5th starting position. Chet Gardner's engine <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> and damaged the crankcase. Carl Marchese hit the wall, and would require repairs. Both Gardner and Marchese were expected to attempt to qualify sometime on Monday or Tuesday.|$|R
50|$|Four {{other drivers}} {{took to the}} track, but failed to {{complete}} their runs. Bill Denver quit after two laps. Rick Decker, making his second attempt, blew an engine after completing only one lap. Likewise, Julius C. Slade, also making his second attempt in two days, <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> on his final lap. Babe Stapp took to the track just before sundown, but pulled off the track apparently before starting the attempt.|$|R
50|$|The hard luck {{story of}} the race belonged to Lou Moore. After {{finishing}} second in 1928, Moore {{was on his way}} to back-to-back runner-up finishes. With two laps to go, however, his engine <b>threw</b> a <b>rod.</b> Due to the rules at the time, since Moore was not running at the finish, he was scored behind all finishers. He fell all the way back to 13th position, behind four cars that actually had fewer laps than he had.|$|R
50|$|A {{day after}} {{practicing}} over 100 mph, Joe Huff did not disappoint, {{putting in the}} second-fastest speed of the afternoon. Rick Decker, who <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> and blew the engine in his #31 Decker Special on Monday, spent the day working a new engine. Decker {{made a deal with}} Fred Clemmons, owner of the #48 Hoosier Pete entry. Clemmons was unable to secure a chassis for his 4-cylinder Hoosier Pete engine, so he allowed Decker to install it in his car. The team expected to be out on the track for Wednesday.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, DePaolo {{drove the}} Harry Miller {{four wheel drive}} race car in races {{throughout}} Europe and Africa. At the Avus course, near Berlin, while leading the race in a down pour, his engine <b>threw</b> 2 connecting <b>rods</b> which narrowly missed hitting Adolph Hitler in his track side box seat.|$|R

60|$|Dan {{would not}} say so, but he feared just that. What miserable black luck! Almost I <b>threw</b> the <b>rod</b> and reel overboard. Some sense, however, {{prevented}} me from such an absurdity. And as I worked the tuna closer and closer I grew absolutely sick with disappointment. The only {{thing to do was}} to haul this little fish in and go hunt up the school. So I pumped and pulled. That half-hour seemed endless and bad business altogether. Anger possessed me and I began to work harder. At this juncture Shorty's boat appeared close to us. Shorty and Adams waved me congratulations, and then made motions to Dan to get the direction of the school of tuna. That night both Shorty and Adams told me that I was working very hard on the fish, too hard to save any strength for a long battle.|$|R
50|$|With Ribbs {{behind the}} wheel of the #36 Duntov 1969 Corvette, it {{appeared}} he was in position to drive to victory. Second place Rick Blaha pitted and handed the car over to Sarah Fisher. Furthermore, race leader Jody O'Donnell in the #46A Corvette never pitted, and he and Roberto Guerrero were disqualified. Willy T. Ribbs re-took the lead but with just minutes left in the race, the engine <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> and came to a stop out on the track. Sarah Fisher benefited greatly from the resulting full-course caution, and was able to complete the team's driver switch under the yellow. Fisher drove to victory, winning by a full lap over the car of Peter Klutt/Al Unser Jr. Fisher became the first female driver to win an automobile race of any kind at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.|$|R
5000|$|Thursday May 24: With {{only two}} days before {{elimination}} trials were set to begin, there was a potential that less than a full field of 33 cars would make the starting grid. Kelly Petillo crashed his Eglin Piston Pin Special in turn one. Petillo was uninjured, but the car was too damaged to repair. Also experiencing trouble was Herman Schurch in the Sievers Special, which <b>threw</b> a <b>rod.</b> Of the original 36 entries, the cars of Prince Ghica and Shorty Cantlon were no shows, and with two cars already out, only 32 cars were left. A check around the garage area indicated that at least 23 cars were planning to qualify on Saturday, led by Leon Duray, Cliff Bergere, and Peter DePaolo. Ray Keech broke an exhaust pipe on Thursday, and the crew {{would have to make}} quick repairs in order that {{he would be able to}} qualify on Saturday.|$|R
50|$|Being a 90-degree V6, Chevrolet {{took steps}} to {{eliminate}} the rough running tendencies of the 200. The crankshaft has each of its connecting <b>rod</b> <b>throws</b> offset by 18 degrees for each pair of rods. This required the connecting rods to have 0.050-inch narrower ends {{as well as a}} thrust bearing to be installed between each pair of rods. However, the connecting rods were still the same 5.7-inch length as most other small-block Chevrolet V8 engines. This produced an engine with a semi-even fire sequence of 132 degrees/108 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Allard {{competed in}} the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1951, 1952 and 1953 but did not finish. In 1951 he shared a works J2 with the American driver Tom Cole and retired with gearbox failure. In 1952 he and Jack Fairman drove the works J2X, chassis number 3055, fitted with a Chrysler hemi engine, where the car retired at 6.30 a.m. having <b>thrown</b> a <b>rod.</b> In 1953 he shared a Cadillac-engined Allard J2R with Philip Fotheringham-Parker, leading the race {{at the end of}} the first lap, but on lap four he was the first to retire with {{collapsed}} rear suspension and a severed brake pipe. In 1952 and 1953 a sister car was driven at Le Mans by Zora Arkus-Duntov, a one-time Allard employee. Carroll Shelby also raced an Allard-Cadillac J2 in the United States early in his driving career. Thus the successful Allard formula of an American V8 engine in a light chassis inspired the development of the Chevrolet Corvette and the A.C. Shelby Cobra.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a reduced}} {{threshold}} {{for the standard}} of care owed by children. In the Australian case of McHale v Watson, McHale, a 9-year-old girl was blinded in one eye after being hit by the ricochet of a sharp metal <b>rod</b> <b>thrown</b> by a 12-year-old girl, Watson. The defendant child was held {{not to have the}} level of care to the standard of an adult, but of a 12-year-old child with similar experience and intelligence. Kitto J explained that a child's lack of foresight is a characteristic they share with others at that stage of development.|$|R
50|$|Keaton {{performed}} many dangerous physical stunts on {{and around}} the moving train, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow-moving train while holding a railroad tie, and running along the roof. One {{of the most dangerous}} ones involved Keaton sitting on one of the coupling rods that connected the drivers of the locomotive; had the locomotive suffered a wheel spin, Keaton might have been <b>thrown</b> from the <b>rod</b> and injured or killed. Shot in one take, the scene shows the train starting gently and gradually picking up speed as it enters a shed, while Keaton, his character distracted and heartbroken, pretends to be oblivious.|$|R
50|$|While Keech cruised to victory, {{the race}} now {{came down to}} {{who was going to}} finish second. Barney Kloepfter pulled Lou Moore's car into the pits with two laps to go. The engine was clanking, {{suffering}} from burned out bearings. Lou Moore got back in the car, attempting to nurse the final two laps out of the machine. Still holding a lead of at least a few minutes over third place, he was able to crank the car one more time, and pulled away. He only got as far as turn two, and the engine <b>threw</b> a <b>rod</b> down the backstretch. Due to the rules at the time, all cars that were running at the finish were ranked ahead of cars that dropped out, regardless of total lap count. Since Moore was not running at the finish, he was scored behind all finishers. He fell {{all the way back to}} 13th position, behind three cars that actually had fewer laps than he had. But more frustrating for Moore was the loss of over $12,000 in prize money. His lap prize money $2,200 and 13th place purse of $462 was of little consolation.|$|R
50|$|The {{connecting}} rod is under tremendous stress from the reciprocating load {{represented by the}} piston, actually stretching and being compressed with every rotation, and the load increases as {{the square of the}} engine speed increase. Failure of a connecting <b>rod,</b> usually called <b>throwing</b> a <b>rod,</b> {{is one of the most}} common causes of catastrophic engine failure in cars, frequently putting the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby rendering the engine irreparable; it can result from fatigue near a physical defect in the rod, lubrication failure in a bearing due to faulty maintenance, or from failure of the rod bolts from a defect, improper tightening or over-revving of the engine. In an unmaintained, dirty environment, a water or chemical emulsifies with the oil that lubricates the bearing and causes the bearing to fail. Re-use of rod bolts is a common practice as long as the bolts meet manufacturer specifications. Despite their frequent occurrence on televised competitive automobile events, such failures are quite rare on production cars during normal daily driving. This is because production auto parts have a much larger factor of safety, and often more systematic quality control.|$|R
50|$|By 1983, {{most of the}} original-cabbed DG {{class had}} been withdrawn, while the re-cabbed {{locomotives}} continued in service until they either suffered a mechanical failure, required major repairs or were withdrawn serviceable and placed in storage. On 28 August 1983, NZR operated a 'Farewell to the DG Class' excursion between Christchurch and Arthur's Pass on the Midland line. Hauled by recabbed DG 2007 and 'slave' unit DG 2468, {{the first and last}} DG class locomotives respectively, the excursion marked the end of the original DG class in regular service. The following month, DG 2007 failed when it <b>threw</b> a con <b>rod</b> through the engine block and was placed in storage, while DG 2468 was sold to the fledgling Weka Pass Railway shortly after.|$|R
50|$|When the sorcerers {{came to the}} Pharaoh, {{he promised}} them {{that they would be}} amongst the honored among his {{assembly}} if they won. On the day of the festival of Egypt, Moses granted the sorcerers the chance to perform first and warned them that God would expose their tricks. The Qur'an states that the sorcerers bewitched the eyes of the observing people and caused terror into them. The summoned sorcerers <b>threw</b> their <b>rods</b> on the floor and they appeared to change into snakes by the effect of their magic. At first, Moses became concerned witnessing the tricks of the magicians, but was assured by God to not be worried. When Moses reacted likewise with his rod, the serpent devoured all the snakes. The sorcerers realized that they had witnessed a miracle. They proclaimed belief in the message of Moses and fell onto their knees in prostration despite threats from the Pharaoh. Pharaoh was enraged by this and accused them of working under Moses. He warned them that if they insisted in believing in Moses, that he would cut their hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify them on the trunks of palm trees for their firmness in their faith. The magicians, however, remained steadfast to their newfound faith and were killed by Pharaoh.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year (1963), Graham Hill and Rodríguez drove {{the car to}} a third-place finish at the 12 Hours of Sebring behind newer factory mid-engine 250 P prototypes whilst at one time, it held a 3-lap lead over its teammates until mechanical and electrical problems slowed the car down {{as well as the}} driver having to deal with exhaust fumes caused by split exhaust manifold. The 330 returned to Le Mans to defend its title but with wider tires.Partnering with Roger Penske and starting from the pole position, it trailed in second place against the factory Ferraris until the ninth hour when the engine <b>threw</b> a connecting <b>rod.</b> Oil spilled on the rear tires, causing the car to crash and taking along Jo Bonnier's Porsche 718/8 GTR with it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was several}} minutes before Oliver aroused {{himself from the}} {{abstracted}} position {{in which he was}} standing when Louisa last saw him; but when he did, he muttered something rapidly and incoherently, and, <b>throwing</b> his <b>rod</b> over his shoulder, he strode down the walk through the gate and along one of the streets of the village, until he reached the lake-shore, with the air of an emperor. At this spot boats were kept for the use of Judge Temple and his family. The young man threw himself into a light skiff, and, seizing the oars, he sent it across the lake toward the hut of Leather-Stocking, with a pair of vigorous arms. By the time he had rowed a quarter of a mile, his reflections were less bitter; and when he saw the bushes that lined the shore in front of Natty’s habitation gliding by him, as if they possessed the motion which proceeded from his own efforts, he was quite cooled in mind, though somewhat heated in body. It is quite possible that the very same reason which guided the conduct of Miss Temple suggested itself to a man of the breeding and education of the youth; and it is very certain that, if such were the case, Elizabeth rose instead of falling in the estimation of Mr. Edwards.|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} was trifling, {{the water was}} shallow, {{the bed of the}} river was (fortunately for me) of sand. Beyond the fright and the wetting I had nothing to complain of. In a few moments I was {{out of the water and}} up again, very much ashamed of myself, on the firm ground. Short as the interval was, it proved long enough to favor the escape of the fish. The angler had heard my first instinctive cry of alarm, had turned, and had <b>thrown</b> aside his <b>rod</b> to help me. We confronted each other for the first time, I on the bank and he in the shallow water below. Our eyes encountered, and I verily believe our hearts encountered at the same moment. This I know for certain, we forgot our breeding as lady and gentleman: we looked at each other in barbarous silence.|$|R
60|$|The unfortunate to {{be punished}} held out his arm at a level with his shoulder, back uppermost. Raising his arm so that the rod fell almost {{straight}} behind his back, Dr. Litter would bring it down, stroke after stroke, with a passionless and mechanical air, but with a sweeping force which did its work thoroughly. Four cuts was the normal number, {{but if it was}} the third time a boy had been sent up during the term he would get six. But four sufficed to swell the back of the hand, and cover it with narrow weals and bruises. It was of course a point of honour that no sound should be uttered during punishment. When it was over the Doctor would <b>throw</b> the broken <b>rod</b> scornfully upon the ground and return to his seat. The Junior then carried it away and placed a fresh one upon the desk.|$|R
5000|$|According to Islamic tradition, Moses {{departed}} for Egypt {{along with his}} family after completing the time period. The Qur'an states that during their travel, as they stopped near the Tur, Moses observed a fire and instructed the family to wait until he returned with fire for them. When Moses reached the Valley of Tuwa, God called out {{to him from the}} right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as Al-Buq‘ah Al-Mubārakah (الـبُـقـعَـة الـمُـبَـارَكَـة, [...] "The Ground the Blessed") in the Qur'an. Moses was commanded by God to remove his shoes and was informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Moses was then ordered to <b>throw</b> his <b>rod</b> which turned into a snake and later instructed to hold it. The Qur'an then narrates Moses being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and upon revealing it would shine a bright light. God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Moses to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God. Moses states his fear of Pharaoh and requests God to heal his speech , and grant him his brother Aaron (Harun) as a helper. According to Islamic tradition, both of them stated their fear of Pharaoh but were assured by God that He would be observing them and commands them to inform the Pharaoh to free the Israelites. Therefore, they depart to preach to the Pharaoh.|$|R
