5|$|It was {{not until}} 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were {{put to the test}} {{for the first time in}} the First Siege of Gibraltar. That year Ferdinand IV of Castile and James II of Aragon joined forces to attack the Muslim Emirate of Granada, {{targeting}} Almería in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west. In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both Algeciras and Gibraltar. By this time the latter had a modest population of around 1,200 people, a castle and rudimentary fortifications. They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month. Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians. A keep and dockyard were built on his orders to secure Castile's hold on the peninsula. Ferdinand also issued a letters patent granting privileges to the inhabitants <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> settle, as it was initially not regarded as a particularly hospitable place to live.|$|E

25|$|Health psychologists help {{to promote}} health and {{well-being}} by preventing illness. Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{articles}} of association often includes an indemnification provision holding the officers harmless for losses occurring due to {{their role in the}} company. The purchased insurance is typically in addition to this corporate indemnification, or reimburses the corporation. In some states corporations may be mandated to indemnify directors and officers in order <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> take the positions and in most cases the corporations have the option to indemnify their officers. However, in certain cases the corporation may be explicitly forbidden from indemnifying such director or officer. Liabilities which aren't indemnified by the corporation are potentially covered by certain types of D insurance (particularly Side-A Broad Form DIC policies).|$|E
25|$|As {{did other}} colonies, Maryland used the headright system <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> bring in new {{settlers}}.

25|$|Immigration {{patterns}} of the 1930s were dominated by the Great Depression. In the final prosperous year, 1929, there were 279,678 immigrants recorded, but in 1933, only 23,068 came to the U.S. In the early 1930s, more people emigrated from the United States than to it. The U.S. government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily move to Mexico, but thousands were deported against their will. Altogether about 400,000 Mexicans were repatriated. Most of the Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis and World War II were barred from coming to the United States. In the post-war era, the Justice Department launched Operation Wetback, under which 1,075,168 Mexicans were deported in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Traffic and {{transportation}} remain {{a problem in}} urban areas. Solutions are implemented, but inevitably the implementation expense and {{the time required to}} plan, approve, and build infrastructure can't keep pace with the population growth. There have been some improvements. Carpool lanes have become common in urban areas, which are intended <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> drive together rather than in individual automobiles. San Jose is gradually building a light rail system (often over routes of an original turn-of-the-century electric railroad line that was torn out and paved over to encourage the advent of the automobile age). None of the implemented solutions are without their critics. The sprawling nature of the Bay Area and of the Los Angeles Basin makes it difficult to build mass transit that can reach and serve {{a significant portion of the}} population.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} decorated, outdoor {{national}} Christmas tree {{originated with}} Frederick Morris Feiker.

In 1921, Feiker joined the personal staff of United States Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover as a press aide. The Society for Electrical Development (an electrical industry trade group) was looking for a way <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> purchase more electric Christmas lights and use electricity, and Feiker suggested that President Calvin Coolidge personally light the tree as a way of giving Christmas lights prominence and social cachet. Vermont Republican Senator Frank L. Greene accompanied Feiker to the White House, where they successfully convinced Coolidge to light the tree.|$|E
