5|$|Isle of Portland has a Non-League {{football}} club Portland United F.C. who play at Grove Corner. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very successful youth set up called Portland United youth football Club who provide active team sport for over 170 {{children on the}} Island.|$|E
5|$|Massive main {{sequence}} stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000K. Smaller {{stars such as}} the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600K; but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities are {{administered}} by a council of 23 members elected every four years. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...). The mayor primarily deals with these departments.|$|E

5|$|Posey {{married his}} high school sweetheart, Kristen, in January 2009. They had twins in 2011. Posey lives {{with his family in}} the East Bay during the season, and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> home in Georgia during the off-season.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|Young have {{a shrill}} closed-bill call, which they use in begging and to contact their parents. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long call used in {{response}} to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> son, William V, {{who succeeded}} to the march.|$|R
5000|$|Many genealogies {{accept the}} high {{likelihood}} that <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter: ...|$|R

5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all times of the day. They are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> award winning marching and symphonic {{band and}} various music ensembles.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 Price {{married his}} current wife Alison Thomas and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{outstanding}} {{sense of}} smell, and tactile {{response in the}} snout region.|$|R
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{track in}} Petz: Dogz 2 called [...] "Pop Pop Radio instrumental".|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> adopted son named Diego Mendez de Segura {{who became}} Christopher Columbus' secretary.|$|R
50|$|Asti fare {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} pasta, seafood, and meat dishes. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lengthy wine list.|$|R
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light {{back through the}} rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{shareholding}} in Carlisle-based CFM Radio, {{holding a}} further stake in neighbouring Border Television.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, Logansport State Hospital <b>had</b> <b>a</b> surgery unit {{in which}} they did lobotomies. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> ward that housed {{tuberculosis}} patients. The facility <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> morgue and pathology lab. Since that time {{it has been used}} for a TV Studio and administrative offices. It is now the home of a museum, which was formerly known as the Longcliff Museum. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chapel which is still in use.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{interest}} in urban guerrilla warfare and studied material on resistance movements.|$|R
5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|Type I diamond has {{nitrogen}} (N) atoms as {{the main}} impurity, at a concentration of up to 1%. If the N atoms are in pairs or larger aggregates, they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type Ia. About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia: these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only ~0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is usually of type Ib. Type Ia and Ib diamonds absorb in both the infrared and ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 320nm. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> characteristic fluorescence and visible absorption spectrum (see Optical properties).|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based battlefield, with {{objectives}} which range from clearing enemy groups to capturing points of importance. Each map has unique terrain to be negotiated in battle ranging from mountains to rivers and flat plains. Viewed from an overhead perspective, there are castles and locations such as shops that the player can visit, the latter of which provides a means for obtaining items. Each chapter has {{a different set of}} victory conditions, which can be related to the number of turns taken or how the enemy force is dealt with. Battles play out using a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During battle, the combat screen appears, showing the fight from a sidelong perspective. Both sides move at least once, after which the combat screen fades. Battles between individual units are governed by the series' recurring Weapons Triangle, a rock–paper–scissors system where certain weapons have advantages over others — lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. As they participate in battles, each unit gains experience points (EXP) from their actions: they raise their experience level by one when they have accumulated 100 EXP. EXP can be earned in both normal battles and challenge fights in special arenas. Players can save {{at the end of each}} chapter or outside battle. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> single mid-chapter save available. All units are subject to permanent death: If a unit dies in battle, they are removed from the rest of the campaign.|$|E
