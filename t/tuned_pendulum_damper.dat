40|$|Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) {{supplement}} existing structures with damping {{while preserving}} stability. As evolutions {{of the structure}} to be controlled may pull down the performance {{of this kind of}} device, large bridges under construction in windy areas are rather equipped with active devices such as AMDs that prove efficient (7 th International Seminar on Seismic Isolation, Passive Energy Dissipation and Active Control of Vibrations of Structures, Assisi, Italy, 2001). However, active devices suffer from several drawbacks such as the necessity to carefully prevent from instability, {{especially in the case of}} noncollocated control. Therefore, a natural question arises: how to adapt a TMD in such a way to make its performance independent of the structural evolution? A new type of semi-active control system matching this requirement is presented. It builds upon a TMD of pendulum type. In order to damp the torsional mode of a bridge under construction, a gear with an alternator would connect the pendulum to the structure. As the bridge starts vibrating, the pendulum begins to oscillate and the alternator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy to be dissipated through an exterior resistor via the Joule effect. Given an optimal design of a passive <b>tuned</b> <b>pendulum</b> <b>damper</b> (TPD) for the structure in its current configuration, the semi-active control strategy consists in changing the resistor in real-time in such a way to lock the apparent stiffness and damping of the real TPD at their desired optimal values no matter the current construction step. Resistor tuning is mandatory even when only one construction step is considered since a constant resistor within the alternator would yield a time-varying effective damping coefficient of the pendulum, whereas the desired optimal damping assumes a given value, which does not change until the structure or load type changes. The semi-active control law easily adapts to any change of the structure provided this change is known. The control algorithm relies on the knowledge of the pendulum rotation, of the frequency of the mode to be controlled and of its modal participation factor at the TPD location. These modal parameters are computed during the construction process, or can be viewed as outputs of a SHM system. How to get these parameters has already received a lot of attention in the SHM literature and is not discussed here. Experimental validations on a small-scale bridge mock-up confirm the interest of the approach...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique for}} fluid-structure interaction, {{which is based}} on the finite element method (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), was developed for application to an industrial chimney equipped with a <b>pendulum</b> <b>tuned</b> mass <b>damper</b> (TMD). In order to solve the structural problem, a one-dimensional beam model (Navier-Bernoulli) was considered and, for the dynamical problem, the standard second-order Newmark method was used. Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow are solved in several horizontal planes to determine the pressure in the boundary of the corresponding cross-section of the chimney. Forces per unit length were obtained by integrating the pressure and are introduced in the structure using standard FEM interpolation techniques. For the fluid problem, a fractional step scheme based on a second order pressure splitting has been used. In each fluid plane, the displacements have been taken into account considering an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian approach. The stabilization of convection and diffusion terms is achieved by means of quasi-static orthogonal subscales. For each period of time, the fluid problem was solved and the geometry of the mesh of each fluid plane is updated according to the structure displacements. Using this technique, along-wind and across-wind effects have been properly explained. The method was applied to an industrial chimney in three scenarios (with or without TMD and for different damping values) and for two wind speeds, showing different responses.

40|$|Vibration {{control of}} a main system, which is modelized by two-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system, with two autoparametric {{vibration}} absorbers has been experimented and simulated.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to describe the design, construction, implementation and performance of a prototype adaptive <b>pendulum</b> <b>tuned</b> mass <b>damper</b> (APTMD). Furthermore the thesis aims at demonstrating the performance improvements obtained when the tuned mass damper (TMD) parameters are optimized. The study considers the effect of adjusting the APTMD tuned frequency and damping ratio on a two storey test structure subjected to broadband and narrowband excitation. An analytical model of the APTMD for a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structure is used to demonstrate the performance improvements when the APTMD parameters are optimized. The optimized model considers the effects of adjusting the frequency ratio, damping ratio, and mass ratio of the combined system to reduce the maximum deflection when the structure is subjected to a harmonic excitation force. The analytical model is used to simulate the optimal performance of the APTMD system. The experimental APTMD is capable of identifying the structural vibration modes in real time and tuning to the desired mode. The structural vibration modes are identified by calculating the windowed power spectral density of the structure’s acceleration, followed by peak-picking algorithm to identify the modal frequencies. Tuning is performed by moving the pivot location of the pendulum arm via a tuning frame along a set of rails. The design also allows {{for changes in the}} external dampening force. An adjustable damper is attached to the pendulum mass to allow for control of the APTMD damping ratio. A prototype of the APTMD is built and tested in a modal testing setup. The test structure is a two-storey model of a building structure. The structure is excited using a shaker fixed to the lower storey of the structure. The performance of the APTMD under broadband and narrowband excitation is examined for various tuning and damping parameters. The performance of the APTMD system under optimally tuned and detuned conditions is investigated. The results of the experimental studies demonstrate the importance of optimizing the TMD tuned frequency and damping ratio to reduce structural vibrations. Since the APTMD is designed to autonomously update both parameters, it is an effective tool in mitigating structural vibrations where user interaction is either difficult or expensive. Further study on the performance of a prototype APTMD applied to a large scale structure is required before implementation on full-scale structures...|$|R

The existence of e#cient computational methods has been crucial in making balancing an e#ective and important tool for model reduction of linear systems. The balancing change of coordinates can be computed using established matrix equation and decomposition algorithms.

Pendulosity {{refers to a}} pendulum-oscillatory mode that can occur during descent under main parachutes {{and that has been}} observed during Orion parachute drop tests. The pendulum mode reduces the ability of GN&C to maneuver the suspended vehicle resulting in undesirable increases to structural loads at touch-down. Parachute redesign efforts have been unsuccessful in reducing the pendulous behavior necessitating GN&C mitigation options. An observer has been developed to estimate the pendulum motion as well as the underlying wind velocity vector.

40|$|On 20 August 2010 an {{energetic}} disturbance triggered damped large-amplitude longitudinal (LAL) oscillations in almost an entire filament. In the present work we analyze this periodic {{motion in the}} filament to characterize the damping and restoring mechanism of the oscillation. Our method involves placing slits along the axis of the filament at different angles {{with respect to the}} spine of the filament, finding the angle at which the oscillation is clearest, and fitting the resulting oscillation pattern to decaying sinusoidal and Bessel functions. These functions represent the equations of motion of a <b>pendulum</b> <b>damped</b> by mass accretion. With this method we determine the period and the decaying time of the oscillation. Our preliminary results support the theory presented by Luna and Karpen (2012) that the restoring force of LAL oscillations is solar gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate, and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Following an earlier paper, we have determined the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic flux tubes hosting a thread along the filament, as well as the mass accretion rate of the filament threads, via the fitted parameters.

40|$|Various {{versions}} of pendulum masses {{have been developed}} abroad within {{the past few years}} by means of which resonant vibrations of rotating shafts can be eliminated at a given tuning. They are already successfully employed on radial engines in the form of pendulous counterweights. Compared with the commonly known torsional vibration dampers, the pendulum masses have the advantage of being structurally very simple, requiring no internal damping and being capable of completely eliminating certain vibrations. Unexplained, so far, remains the problem of behavior of pendulum masses in other critical zones to which they are not tuned, their dynamic behavior at some tuning other than in resonance, and their effect within a compound vibration system and at simultaneous application of several differently tuned pendulous masses.

A theoretical framework for predicting the buffeting response of the coupled MPMD-bridge system was first developed. Four different construction stages of the bridge were selected for study. The effectiveness of MPMD was further examined by an experimental investigation.

Diderot wrote the Memoir in order to clarify an assumption Newton made without further justification in the first pages of the Principia in connection with an experiment to verify the Third Law of Motion using colliding pendulums. To explain the differences between experimental and theoretical values of momentum in the collision experiments he conducted Newton assumed that the bob was retarded by an air resistance F_R proportional to the velocity v. By giving Newton's arguments a mathematical scaffolding and recasting his geometrical reasoning in the language of differential calculus, Diderot provides a step-by-step solution guide to the problem and proposes experiments to settle the question about the appropriate form of F_R, which for Diderot quadratic in v, that is F_R ∼ v^ 2.
