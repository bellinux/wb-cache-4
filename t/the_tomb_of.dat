5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but broke into <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, {{probably due to the}} quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (r. 1353–1336 BC), the Great Hymn to the Aten—preserved in tombs of Amarna, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Ay—was written to the Aten, the sun-disk deity given exclusive patronage during his reign.

5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia.

There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> {{the king}} was {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> {{the king was}} hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|On the way back, {{they stayed}} again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawing and {{paintings}} of the monuments there.

They also located <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted.

5|$|Several tombs of antipopes were desecrated and destroyed, {{often by}} their rival claimants, shortly after their creation. For example, Pope Innocent II razed Santa Maria in Trastevere (one {{of the main}} Marian basilicas {{and one of the}} oldest churches of Rome) to the ground and was {{eventually}} buried over the spot once occupied by <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> his rival, Pope Anacletus II. Others survived centuries, only to be destroyed during conflicts such as the French Revolution and the War of the Spanish Succession, a fate common to some non-extant papal tombs. Such was the case with <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Antipope Felix V (the last historical antipope), who was buried with most of his predecessors as Count of Savoy in Hautecombe Abbey.|$|E
