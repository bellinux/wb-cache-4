50|$|As {{usual for}} barges they were carvel built, with bluff bows and rounded bilges. The stem post is high with a <b>towing</b> <b>bitt</b> behind, {{and with a}} canoe stern. Both stem and stern had a small decked area. The bow carried a large iron {{windlass}} and the stern provided a small living cabin beneath the deck. There was no sailing mast or propulsion, as they were bank-hauled by horses.|$|E
5000|$|Valiant has a 25 mm machine cannon {{mounted on}} the bow and is capable of firing high {{explosive}} projectiles {{at a rate of}} 180 round per minute. In addition, the vessel mounts two [...]50 caliber heavy machine guns. The 24 foot [...] "Cutter Boat Large" [...] (CBL) and the 23 foot [...] "Over The Horizon" [...] (OTH) are used to visit and board other vessels at sea. The special <b>towing</b> <b>bitt</b> on the fantail allows Valiant to tow vessels up to 10 times her size. Another feature of Valiant is her ability to carry a Coast Guard HH-65 Dolphin helicopter. The helicopter extends the ships surveillance range for law enforcement and reduces response time for search and rescue mission.|$|E
50|$|Built {{for hard}} {{service in the}} port the vessel had {{strengthened}} <b>towing</b> <b>bitts</b> and ice guards and a hull with three watertight bulkheads. The deck house contained rooms for the captain and mate with a galley aft. An 8 ft square hatch was located on the foredeck for access below.|$|R
50|$|The {{hull and}} {{wheelhouse}} are made entirely of wood, with a fibreglass hat and smokestack. It has a 'face' on the funnel, with large realistic hydraulic eyes which {{are no longer}} operational. The boat displays a number of prop details such as winches and <b>towing</b> <b>bitts</b> inspired from real tugs but operates as a tour boat, not a real tug boat.|$|R
5000|$|The Defender class {{utilizes}} a rigid deep-V hull {{constructed of}} marine grade aluminum. While similar in appearance to the sponson of a rigid-hulled inflatable boat the Defender's collar is actually made from rigid polyethylene foam. The boat {{is powered by}} two [...] outboard engines, usually Honda four-strokes though Mercury and Johnson engines have also been used. <b>Tow</b> <b>bitts</b> are fitted forward and aft which also serve as mounting points for M240B or M60 machine guns.|$|R
