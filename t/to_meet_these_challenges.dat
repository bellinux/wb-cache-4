This is mainly due to their increased use in various challenging fields of engineering and science. One such challenging application is the use of master–slave concept in a robot-assisted surgery. The authors have already performed the kinematic study and gravity balancing of seven degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) surgeon-side manipulator (Singh et al., 2015 a, 2015 b). <b>To</b> <b>meet</b> <b>these</b> <b>challenging</b> demands, {{the most important aspect of}} a robotic manipulator is to develop an accurate kinematic model.

Out of these, the most prominent one is D–H parameters method, which was proposed by Denavit and Hartenberg in 1955. In the present work, this method is applied to a five-DOFs spatial manipulator, named as patient-side manipulator, which tracks the motion of surgeon-side manipulator during a robot-assisted surgery.
