5|$|In the 18th and 19th century, {{green was}} {{associated}} with the romantic movement in literature and art. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared <b>that</b> <b>green</b> was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, {{green and}} blue were {{sometimes}} considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described {{the color of the}} sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered <b>that</b> <b>green</b> was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E

In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years {{without the possibility of}} parole. Green denied being under the influence of any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said <b>that</b> <b>green</b> screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{also show}} <b>that</b> <b>green</b> {{is the color}} most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance.

Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E

5|$|The {{family moved}} to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the {{frontier}} violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> had pioneered elsewhere.

The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} both city {{planners}} and citizens are increasingly promoting greening strategies {{as a way}} to effectively respond to issues of urban liveability, public health, and climate change. Greening initiatives include, inter alia, the promotion of community gardens, parks, forests, recycling programs, street closures, street trees, sustainable housing, sustainable transportation, and urban farming. This movement is particularly promising given that in 2014, 53, 6 % of the global population lived in urban areas, a figure that is set to rise to 60, 0 % by 2030. In their recently published book, Gould and Lewis (2017), however, argue that, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>greening</b> initiatives have the potential to address the issues mentioned above, they also entail a risk of causing or enhancing gentrification and displacement. This paper contributes to the debates on urban greening and sustainability by using a case study approach to examine how bottom-up greening initiatives can be entangled with or engender processes of gentrification and displacement. More specifically, attention is focused on a grassroots greening initiative called Living Streets (Leefstraten) initiated in Brugse Poort, a gentrifying neighbourhood of Ghent (Belgium). This initiative, in which residents make their street (partially) car-free for a period of two months, aims to create a temporary place for greenery and social living. As such, it actively contributes to the transition of Ghent to a climate-neutral city. Although Living Streets advocates often appeal to an apolitical or post-political discourse of ecological sustainability and urban liveability, they have met with serious opposition, mostly from incumbent residents. Drawing on 37 in-depth interviews, both with incumbent (N= 20) and newly arrived residents (N= 17), this study shows <b>that</b> <b>greening</b> initiatives in Brugse Poort not only are emblematic of a wider gentrification process but also exacerbate this process. More specifically, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>greening</b> initiatives in Brugse Poort are inducing a variety of displacement pressures such as economic displacement, community displacement, and neighbourhood resource displacement. The reason for such a wide-spread displacement lies in the fact <b>that</b> <b>greening</b> initiatives are causing more than just soaring housing costs. In fact, our results indicate <b>that</b> <b>greening</b> initiatives promoted by newly arrived residents have significantly redefined the place-identity of the neighbourhood and its socio-political hierarchy which in turn have led to the increasing out-of placeness and marginalization of incumbent residents. The paper therefore concludes by stressing the importance of developing <b>greening</b> initiatives <b>that</b> are environmentally as well as socially sustainable...|$|R

5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued <b>that</b> <b>green</b> timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned <b>that</b> <b>Green,</b> who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

Black deduces <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans <b>that</b> <b>green</b> flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Chongju was {{the furthest}} north that the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate, and on 1 November, {{while still in}} divisional reserve, the brigade was ordered to pull back to Pakchon {{in an attempt to}} {{consolidate}} the western flank. Immediately following their success at Unsan, the Chinese 117th Division of the 39th Army—under the overall command of Zhang Jiecheng—attacked southward, intending to cut off the retreating UN forces and in so doing eliminate the remnants of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division by cutting the road junction at Pakchon. Meanwhile, the Chinese 38th and 40th Armies approached along the Chongchon River from the east. 3 RAR remained at Chongju, however, {{due to a lack of}} transport, while the remainder of the brigade moved south; now the most forward element on the US Eighth Army's left flank, the battalion soon became isolated without communications or armour and artillery support. Finally, on 2 November, US Army trucks became available, and the battalion completed its move south without incident, harbouring in the bed of the Taeryong River that evening. Meanwhile, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Green</b> would be temporarily replaced by Walsh, who he had himself replaced in Japan several months before. Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted back to 3 RAR to resume command, despite his lack of operational experience as an infantry commander. Taking over amid difficult circumstances following Green's death, and with little time to become acquainted with the battalion, Walsh's inexperience soon told as the local situation deteriorated.|$|E
