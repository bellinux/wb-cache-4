5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} was {{supposed}} to revolve around the duo {{trying to get the}} plant back, lest Princess Bubblegum turn into a man. In addition, the episode originally {{was supposed to}} feature a mysterious rabbit <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> Finn and Jake through the Underworld; this character was later cut. The episode was watched by 1.981 million people and received largely positive critical attention. Many critics applauded Ferrer's voice acting work, and Matt Fowler of IGN singled the episode out {{as an example of the}} comedic darkening of Adventure Time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{scenario}} of the British war effort {{and the threat}} from the militant movement in India, {{it was a major}} factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915. Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement. It was also a factor <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy during and after World War I, including the passage of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917. The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union, and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India.|$|E

25|$|If {{civilian}} control {{is the critical}} variable for military effectiveness, it {{raises the question of}} how {{civilian control}} is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E
25|$|In a {{classroom}} {{there may be}} many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level.

The size of the groups will also vary {{depending on how much}} face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> instruction is only for struggling students. This is an opportunity for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.|$|E

25|$|Facing {{problems}} in the British mainland and unable to muster enough forces of collaboration or coercion, the Cabinet mission of 1946 was sent to negotiate the transfer of power. Some historians cite Auchinleck's own assessment of the situation to suggest this shortened the Raj by at least fifteen to twenty years. Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, reflecting on the factors <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> the British decision to relinquish the Raj in India, {{is said to have}} cited the effects of the INA and Bose's activities on the British-Indian Army and the Bombay Mutiny as being the most important.|$|E
25|$|These efforts {{yielded a}} total of 902 runs at 300.66, and nine wickets at 38.66. He was {{selected}} for a non-Test tour of New Zealand by Australia's Second XI, as the first-choice team {{was still in the}} subcontinent. Playing as an opener, he scored 418 runs at 69.66 in four representative matches. This included an unbeaten 129 in the third match <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> Australia to an eight-wicket win. During this period, Simpson transformed into a less flamboyant and more solid player who eschewed the hook shot and swayed backwards to avoid short balls. He also took 10 wickets at 27.60 in the international matches, including 4/80 in the second innings of the second fixture.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{teaches the}} oral traditions by example, {{presenting}} actual cases {{being brought to}} judgment, usually along with {{the debate on the}} matter and the judgment that was given by a notable rabbi based on halakha, mitzvot, and spirit of the teaching ("Torah") <b>that</b> <b>guided</b> his decision. In this way, it brings to everyday reality the practice of the mitzvot as presented in the Torah, and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed since the time when the Second Temple was destroyed (70 CE). The Mishnah does not claim to be the development of new laws, but rather the collection of existing traditions.|$|E
