500|$|West {{has been}} an outspoken and {{controversial}} celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (A Concert for Hurricane Relief), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black hurricane victims. He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. [...] "It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have felt for far too long", argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons.|$|E

Oliver also wrote that older viewers would find Eccleston [...] "easily the best time lord since Tom Baker". Reviewing the first episode, The Stages Harry Venning hailed it as a [...] "fabulous, imaginative, funny and sometimes frightening reinvention" [...] and particularly praised Rose for being an improvement upon previous female companions who were [...] "fit only to scream or be captured". However, he found Eccleston to be [...] "the show’s biggest disappointment" [...] as he looked [...] "uncomfortable playing fantasy". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan found the final episode anticlimactic, but overall said that the series was [...] "excellent Saturday night telly of the kind <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> thought the BBC had forgotten how to make". He praised Eccleston's performance and named [...] "The Empty Child" [...] and [...] "The Doctor Dances" [...] as the best episodes. Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the series a grade of A-, praising its variety. However, he was critical of Davies' [...] "annoying tendency to play to the lowest common denominator with toilet humor", but felt that from [...] "Dalek" [...] on the series was more dramatic and sophisticated.|$|E

500|$|On January 28, 2013, a new CGI special titled Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed was {{announced}} to premiere that year, {{though it was}} later delayed to January 20, 2014. The former Beatle Ringo Starr promoted the special on Cartoon Network singing a new original song [...] "I Wish I Was a Powerpuff Girl" [...] with previews {{leading up to the}} airdate. Ringo also voiced a new character named Fibonacci Sequins in the episode. The special was directed by Dave Smith, who directed episodes for the series in the past, and featured the original cast members reprising their roles. This Powerpuff Girls special marked the first time that series creator Craig McCracken had no input. The episode's plot has Mojo Jojo kidnap Fibonacci along with an opera singer and a badger. The girls rescue all of them, and the powerpuff girls defeat Mojo yet again with his kidnapping plan. Not deterred he then goes on to invent an evil video game called [...] "Dance Pants R-EVILution" [...] to take over Townsville. Common Sense Media gave the special 3/5 stars citing the [...] "tasteful update of the original animation style" [...] however recommends it for older kids around the age of 7. GON (Geeked Out Nation) gave the show a B rank and described it as [...] "...a good special with the return of the characters <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> grew up [...] ", while they said that the special has few flaws.

[...] He praised the gameplay, especially the Good Cop/Bad Cop system and the upgrades system. He also praised the absence of loading screens. However, he wrote of the graphics, [...] "there are far too many clipping issues that come up far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so {{that there will be}} times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's a lot of fun despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked." ...|$|E
