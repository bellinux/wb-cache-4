5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} now, in his <b>time</b> <b>his</b> works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works.

5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first <b>time.</b> <b>His</b> 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only <b>time</b> <b>his</b> bowling average was so high, and he missed three {{weeks of the season}} owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E
