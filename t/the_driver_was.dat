5|$|On 14 March 1980, {{an empty}} stock train {{comprising}} five Hastings Unit vehicles derailed at Appledore due to excessive speed through {{a set of}} points. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed. A motor coach was consequently withdrawn from service due to extensive damage.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
50|$|Jordan: 0.05. Breathalyzer {{testing is}} not {{routinely}} used. If suspected by police <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> produced before <b>the</b> closest government medical officer who examines and determines whether <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> under influence.|$|R
50|$|The tram {{is driven}} by more than 80 {{certified}} <b>drivers.</b> To ensure <b>the</b> safety of the tram and <b>the</b> passengers, every <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> required to take an alcohol test before driving <b>the</b> tram. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> allowed to drive the tram if he passes the test. The tram also have a Dead man's switch, which <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>are</b> required to press every three to five second to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> paying attention. <b>The</b> tram will {{come to a halt}} if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> fails to press the button.|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{approach}} may necessitate creating {{a situation where}} <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> more relaxed in a 'stop' location, whether at a location where <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> taking a break, or purportedly being stopped by police.|$|R
5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the Artificial Passenger is the {{disruptive}} speech recognition. This technology keeps a conversation with <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and analyzes what <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> saying and how s/he is saying it. It can recognize fluctuations in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> voice to determine if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> sleepy, upset, or in a good mood through different vibration patterns in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> speech. It also record the time it takes for a driver to respond in the conversation and from that determine if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> nodding off or being distracted by something.|$|R

40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} (EM) optimization <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> introduced {{which makes}} optimization of electromagnetic components fully automatic. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> composed of an EM simulator and an optimizer. As a test example, an optimum {{design of a}} waveguide-microstrip transition using <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated. <b>The</b> numerical design is verified by the measurement...|$|R
25|$|Also in March 2011, on the New Jersey Turnpike, a crash {{occurred}} in which <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed and 40 injured, two critically.|$|E
25|$|The front-seat male {{passenger}} {{of a car}} on the A329 {{was killed}} when a branch hit the car near Streatley, Berkshire; <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> injured.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting some tradition-based fashions of the time, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> {{confronted by}} a series of knobs of whalebone, while the {{steering}} wheel was covered with walnut.|$|E
50|$|Sri Lanka: 0.06%. Breathalyzer {{testing is}} not used routinely. If {{suspected}} by police <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> produced before <b>the</b> closest government medical officer who examines and determines whether <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> under influence. If <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> refuses examination by the medical officer he is considered to have been under influence by default.|$|R
5000|$|Updated Driver Monitoring System for {{detecting}} whether <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> eyes <b>are</b> properly open. It monitors <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> eyes to detect <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> level of wakefulness. This {{system is designed}} to work even if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> wearing sunglasses, and at night.|$|R

25|$|On 14 September 1929, a {{train was}} derailed at Port-la-Duc. Locomotive No.34 fell down an {{embankment}} and <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed. The cause was a landslip after heavy rain.|$|E
25|$|The no. 700316 6C 2300 tipo Turismo straight-six engine placed behind <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> Alfa Romeo: 2,309cc, iron block, {{light alloy}} head, {{chain-driven}} dual overhead camshafts, spur gears, wet sump lubrication.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, on {{the morning}} of March 10, a {{southbound}} Rail Runner train struck an abandoned car in the South Valley. On August 18, a northbound train was struck by a car which drove {{into the side of the}} train; <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> killed.|$|E
30|$|The {{maximum speed}} of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>was</b> {{analysed}} {{only for the}} free driving scenario, since in the following vehicle scenario, <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> instructed to follow the lead vehicle which moved with a steady speed, and, as such, we expected no significant findings from the observation of their maximum speed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Omega ATI <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} ATI's Catalyst <b>drivers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} notable for resolving 3D compatibility problems affecting past versions of <b>the</b> ATI <b>drivers</b> (versions 7.8-7.12) and some AGP cards.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Driver</b> CPC <b>is</b> {{enforced}} in all European Union (EU) member states. If <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> {{driving in}} another EU country, they must still hold a valid Driver CPC, {{unless they have}} an exemption.|$|R
25|$|On 21 February 2004, at Wellington Quay, Dublin, a bus {{mounted on}} a {{pavement}} and ploughed into a queue of 30 people, killing five and injuring 14. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> tried for dangerous driving causing death, his trial began in February 2007 at Dublin Circuit Court, but was acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The Norton Bridge rail {{crash in}} 2003, saw an {{intermodal}} train hauled by nos. 86631 and 86611, collide with {{the rear of}} another stationary freight train. The force of the impact broke the leading locomotive in half, although <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> not killed. Both locomotives were written off as uneconomical to repair.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2013 an Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 was in {{collision}} with the railway bridge at Duke Street, Chelmsford {{resulting in the}} entire upper deck roof being torn away.

25|$|On 23 June 2013 a Neoplan Tourliner was {{involved}} in the 2013 Podgorica bus crash, 18 people being killed. The Tourliner derailed from a bridge and fell about 40 meters into a ravine. The causes of the accident are uncertain, but survivors claim that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> overspeeding while the tight mountain road was wet after a storm.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 2009, a bus {{en route}} from Abbey Street to Artane {{collided}} with a tree on North Strand Road and the entire roof section was torn off. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> treated in hospital for shock but apart from {{that there were no}} injuries as no passengers were seated in the upper deck. The bus was an Alexander ALX400.|$|E
25|$|The missile hit the bus {{after all}} but one of the {{children}} had been dropped off. The only remaining passenger, a 16-year-old boy, Daniel Viflic, was critically injured with shrapnel wounds to the head and died from his injuries on 17 April. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>was</b> lightly injured. Another mortar barrage was timed to coincide with the arrival of the paramedics, which delayed the evacuation.|$|E
50|$|Lane Keeping Assist - detects road {{markings}} and senses if <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> inadvertently straying {{out of the}} lane. If so, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>is</b> warned by short vibrations of the steering wheel. This system can also distinguish between intentional (for example, overtaking or merging) and unintentional lane departures, {{reducing the number of}} false alarms.|$|R
