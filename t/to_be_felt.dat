5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{many local}} {{businesses}} collapsed, several railroads went bankrupt, and numerous small rural banks folded. Manufacturing {{came to an}} abrupt halt or was severely cut back due the dwindling demand for products. The Depression continued to negatively affect Indiana until the buildup for World War II. The effects continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> for many years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Nestlé {{announced}} on 20 September 2006 {{that it would}} cut 645 jobs at the Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came {{after a number of}} other job losses in the city at Aviva, British Sugar and Terry's chocolate factory. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b>|$|E

50|$|Great Britain {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subject <b>to</b> several {{very minor}} earthquakes each month, and more occasional light to moderate ones. During the 20th century, 25 earthquakes with a moment magnitude of 4.5 <b>to</b> 6.1 <b>were</b> <b>felt,</b> {{many of them}} originating within the Isles themselves.|$|R
5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were too small <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at {{the eastern end of}} a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the western}} fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction. Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily, though most are too weak <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E
5|$|From 4 December 1956 to 26 February 1957, Takechi {{served as}} {{the host of the}} Nippon Television program, The Tetsuji Takechi Hour. The show {{featured}} the Takechi Kabuki's interpretations of such Japanese stage classics as Chūshingura, and was also known for pushing the limits of the coverage of sexual subjects on television for its time. Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the Nissei Theater in Tokyo, not long after it was opened in 1963. Though these would be his last kabuki productions, Takechi's influence on the art form continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> for decades after his departure for the cinema.|$|E

50|$|The severest shocks seem <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>felt</b> {{over the}} whole island of Luzon about 400 mi North to South, and 200 mi East to West. From {{observations}} taken {{it seems that the}} difference in the time between the extreme points was not more than ten minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, Purgatory {{precedes the}} Resurrection--there is continual {{question}} among divines what manner of purgatorial fire {{it may be}} that affects spirits separate from the body--perhaps Heaven and Hell, as opposed <b>to</b> Purgatory, <b>were</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> picturable because not only spirits, but the risen bodies too are conceived in them.|$|R
5|$|Quwatli was {{initially}} {{brought up in}} a pro-Ottoman environment, owing to his family's connections in Istanbul. The restrictions of the Abdul Hamid II era, however, started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> around the Ottoman Empire, and discontent was brewing even among the empire's elite. Following the Young Turk Revolution against Abdul Hamid II in 1908, parliamentary elections were called in all provinces, and liberal Arab intellectuals like Shukri al-Asali, Shafiq Muayyad al-Azm, and Rushdi al-Shama'a secured seats as deputies (members of the legislature) representing Damascus. The liberal current that established itself through these figures, and the political dailies they established including al-Qabas ("The Firebrand") and al-Ikha' al-Arabi ("Arab Brotherhood"), greatly influenced Quwatli and other Arab youths.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{attained}} {{its greatest}} geographic extent, but the attempted union with Russia {{could not have}} been achieved, as the systemic, cultural and religious incompatibilities between the two empires proved to be insurmountable. The territorial annexations and the ruthlessly conducted wars left a legacy of injustice suffered and desire for revenge {{on the part of the}} Russian ruling classes and people. The huge military effort weakened the Commonwealth and the painful consequences of the adventurous policies of the Vasa court and its allied magnates were soon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Rabearivelo {{occurred}} {{just prior to}} the emergence of the Négritude movement, by which time the Malagasy poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as Léopold Sédar Senghor as Africa's first modern poet. The Government of Madagascar declared Rabearivelo its national poet upon independence in 1960. The legacy and influence of his works continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> and his works are a focus of ongoing academic study. Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including Elie Rajaonarison have cited him as a major inspiration. A street and a high school in Antananarivo have been named after him, as has a dedicated room in the National Library of Madagascar.|$|E

5000|$|A coureur des bois (...) or coureur de bois ( [...] , runner of the woods; plural: coureurs de bois) was an {{independent}} entrepreneurial French-Canadian woodsman who traveled in New France {{and the interior}} of North America. They ventured into the woods usually to trade various European items for furs, {{and along the way}} they learned the trades and practices of the Native people. These expeditions were fuelled {{by the beginning of the}} fur trade in the North American interior. Trade began with coat beaver, but as the market grew coureurs de bois were trapping and trading prime beavers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felted</b> in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The rupture {{was located}} on the Nazca plate where it is being pushed beneath the mantle of the South American continent. It shook the ground from Argentina to Canada and its {{oscillations}} <b>were</b> the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captured on a modern seismic network. Light damage <b>to</b> buildings <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|$|R
5|$|The first {{effects of}} the flood began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in Fairbanks late on the 29th, as the Tanana River overflowed its banks and covered low-lying areas of South Fairbanks. Thought was given on that date to closing the {{floodgates}} of the Moose Creek Dam, located on the Chena River {{as part of the}} Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, but the Chena's rise was not as rapid as that of the Tanana, which lies to the south of the town, and no action was taken on the 29th. Engineers also considered lowering the gates on the 30th, but the flow of the Chena River had not reached a level where computer models mandated the closing of the gates to protect Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{two pairs}} of glands usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These glands are not visible or able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in other}} areas soon began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> The method of {{government}} after the conquest {{can be described as}} a feudal system, in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance, called homage, they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour. Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support, and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services, creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts. This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo-Saxon system of government. The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest, as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church. The more prosperous peasants, however, lost influence and power as the Normans made holding land more dependent on providing labour services to the local lord. They sank down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree villeins or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor or seek alternative employment.|$|E
50|$|Residents of {{the area}} around the launch site <b>were</b> advised <b>to</b> stay indoors, close windows, and turn off air {{conditioning}} systems as a precaution, as some vapours from the fuel could be irritant or toxic. The explosion <b>was</b> reported <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>felt</b> 25 mi away from the launch site, and damage to store windows 10 mi away was reported.|$|R
6000|$|Something of the {{pleasure}} {{that she had}} {{for a long time}} <b>been</b> a stranger <b>to,</b> <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> by Emily Moseley, as the well remembered tower of the village church of B---- struck her sight on their return from their protracted excursion. More than four months had elapsed since they had commenced their travels, and in that period what changes of sentiments had she not witnessed in others; of opinions of mankind in general, and of one individual in particular, had she not experienced in her own person. The benevolent smiles, the respectful salutations they received, in passing the little group of houses which, clustered round the church, had obtained the name of [...] "the village," [...] conveyed a sensation of delight that can only <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> by the deserving and virtuous; and the smiling faces, in several instances glistening with tears, which met them at the Hall, gave ample testimony to the worth of both the master and his servants.|$|R
60|$|She was herself again. Her {{explanation}} was carelessly given. It sounded even convincing, but Duncombe himself was not convinced. He {{knew that she}} wanted him <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> He <b>felt</b> her eyes seeking his, studying his face. Perhaps she was only anxious {{that he should not}} misunderstand.|$|R
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E
25|$|Instruments were {{installed}} {{in and around}} the area in 1974 to closely monitor seismic activity. Since then, more than 4,000 earthquakes have been recorded, most of which were too small <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> On average, one earthquake per year is large enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt</b> in the area.|$|E
25|$|When orally consumed, 2C-B has a {{much longer}} delay {{before the onset of}} effects than when it is insufflated. Oral {{ingestion}} generally takes roughly 45–75 minutes for the effects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt,</b> plateau lasts 2–4 hours, and coming down lasts 1–2 hours. Rectal administration ("boofing") onset varies from 5–20 minutes. Insufflated onset takes 1–10 minutes for effects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>felt.</b> The duration can last from 4 to 12 hours depending on ROA, dose, and other factors.|$|E

50|$|The masses {{are often}} too small <b>to</b> <b>be</b> palpated or <b>felt.</b> A galactogram <b>is</b> {{therefore}} necessary <b>to</b> {{rule out the}} lesion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} {{organized}} on May 3, 1994, in response <b>to</b> what <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a general apostasy of the LDS Church. This apostasy included Brigham Young (and subsequent {{presidents of the}} LDS Church) scattering the LDS Church membership rather than gathering it; the discontinuation of plural marriage; changes to ordinances and temple-related doctrine; and an increasing trend of what TLC describes as [...] "watering-down" [...] doctrine.|$|R

2500|$|The District {{felt the}} 1811-1812 New Madrid earthquakes, and {{according}} to old records, residents were [...] "badly frightened". In March 1828, President John Quincy Adams felt a [...] "violent" [...] earthquake in the White House and wrote it in his journal. The 1886 Charleston earthquake (magnitude 6.6 <b>to</b> 7.3) <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in DC. The strongest earthquake in Virginia happened in 1897 and <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> in the District. An earthquake in 1925 in Canada, estimated about magnitude 7, <b>was</b> <b>felt</b> over an area of 2 million square miles. Another 6.2 earthquake in 1935 caused damage in New York and shook residents from Maine to Wisconsin.|$|R
