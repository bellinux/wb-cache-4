30|$|In {{the late}} 1950 s, {{automatic}} <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{began to be}} used in warehouse automation and factory operations, and Japan began to introduce automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology from then on. In the mid- 1970 s, due to the application of integrated circuit technology and electronic technology in automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> were significantly improved in terms of automation and control performance. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> entered the production system as a production component and has also been rapidly developed [1]. During this period, European companies standardized the size and structure of pallets for containers, which accelerated the development of automated transport technology in Europe [2]. The first International Conference on Unmanned Pallets was held in June 1981 in London, England, which has shown a breakthrough in the technology of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> [3]. In 1984, General Motors first tried an automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> on their flexible assembly system. Two years later, the number of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> increased to 1407, making it the world’s largest automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> user [4]. In 1985, due to the development of computer microprocessors and the rise of control technology, computer communication and identification technology entered the field of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> developed toward intelligence [5]. In 1987, it was reported that Sweden first used automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the field of logistics systems in 1969 [6]. In 1974, the Swedish Volvo Car Company applied automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> to their car assembly lines. This improvement has been a huge success, not only reducing labor, assembly time, and assembly failures, but also speeding up capital flow by 43 % [7]. Many Western European countries have followed suit because of the practical economic benefits of this application. In the 1980 s, the wave of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Europe flooded into the US market. Many US companies transferred advanced automatic guided trolley technology to Metron through technology introduction and joint ventures ([8]. In 1978, a direct computer-controlled automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> system introduced from Europe was successfully applied at the Keebler Distribution Center in Chicago, USA [9]. In 1981, John Corporation of the USA applied automated <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> to automated warehouses to increase the efficiency of material handling during manufacturing, and the entire process was monitored in real time [10]. The French outdoor guide automatic transporter runs at speeds of up to 97 [*]km/h [11]. In the following 10 [*]years, various intelligent automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> have emerged in an endless stream. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on visual navigation have also been greatly developed. At this time, the typical visual navigation system mainly includes ARCADE system of the University of Michigan; LANA system [12]; NAVLAB system of Carnegie Mellon University, USA; EMS, Vision system of German Federal University of Defense; ROMA system of IITB of Germany; and PVS system of MITI of Japan. According to statistics, by 2004, there were more than 16, 000 automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> systems in use worldwide and more than 100, 000 automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> [13].|$|R

30|$|In China, the {{development}} of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> started late. In 1975, China’s first electromagnetically guided three-wheeled automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> was successfully developed at the Beijing Crane Transportation Machinery Research Institute [14]. In the late 1980 s, the Beijing Machinery Industry Automation Research Institute developed the first automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{that can be used}} in the three-dimensional warehouse and successfully applied in the Second Automobile Group. During the same period, the Beijing Postal Research Institute also successfully developed the Automated Guided Car IV [15] using two-way wireless communication technology. In the 1990 s, China’s research on automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> entered a period of rapid development. The automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> imported from abroad was successfully applied to the CIMS experimental research at the National CIMS Engineering Center of Tsinghua University. Shenyang Institute of Automation developed an automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> for automobile engine assembly for Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd., which is a successful application in China’s automobile industry [16]. Kunming Marine Equipment Research Institute successfully developed an automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> based on laser/infrared guidance for the first time. The Intelligent Vehicles Group of Jilin University is mainly engaged in the research of automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on visual navigation. It has developed JUTIV 1 and JUTIV 2 visual navigation vehicles. On this basis, they developed the JUTIV 3, general-purpose and assembly-type visual navigation automatic <b>transport</b> <b>vehicles</b> for the actual application of the factory [17].|$|R

40|$|Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the content of 5 important emergency medical services (EMS) drugs after being stored at the recommended refrigerated temperature, room temperature, or in an emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> operating under real-world working conditions. METHODS: Adrenaline hydrochloride, cisatracurium besylate, lorazepam, methylergonovine maleate, and succinylcholine chloride were stored for 1 year under the 3 conditions. For each storage condition, samples of the drugs were taken after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. For adrenaline hydrochloride, however, the samples were taken after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. The samples were analyzed with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay. A drug was considered stable if its content was above 90 %. RESULTS: Adrenaline hydrochloride and methylergonovine maleate remained stable for 1 year at room temperature and in the emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle.</b> At room temperature and in the emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle,</b> lorazepam became unstable within 4 weeks. Succinylcholine chloride was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for 1 month in the emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Cisatracurium besylate became unstable within 4 months at room temperature. However, it remained stable for 4 months in the emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle.</b> CONCLUSION: When stored at room temperature or in the emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle,</b> lorazepam became unstable within weeks, whereas succinylcholine chloride and cisatracurium besylate became unstable within months. Adrenaline hydrochloride and methylergonovine maleate remained stable for several months, even under room temperature and emergency physician <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> conditions. Thus, real-world EMS working conditions pose challenges for maintaining optimal efficacy of these important EMS drugs. status: publishe...|$|R
