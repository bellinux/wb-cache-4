5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E
5|$|When India gained {{independence}} in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part {{went to the}} Dominion of India (and was named West Bengal), while the eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956). The latter became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after partition in 1947. Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to {{play a significant role}} in <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> socio-economic condition of the state.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E

25|$|Irish {{migration}} to Great Britain {{is an important}} factor in <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> labour markets of the Isles.

This tide has ebbed and flowed in response to politics, economics and social conditions of both places. At the 2011 census, there were 869,000 Irish-born residents in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} goal of Dravidian {{politics was}} to achieve social equality, but it later championed {{the cause of}} ending the domination of North India over <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> economy of the South Indian province known as Madras Presidency. It is an underlying fact that the Church always orchestrate the undercurrents of the Dravidian politics. The church is also widely blamed for their clandestine support for the protests against Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, Methane extraction, Kachatheevu issue, Sri Lankan Tamil issue and Jallikattu. Thus Dravidian politics incorporates elements of Tamil Nationalism and has found support only in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were doing most of the work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of finding something wrong with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E

25|$|During {{a massive}} {{political}} rally in 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan {{was assassinated in}} Rawalpindi, and Nazimuddin became the second prime minister. Tensions in Eastern Pakistan reached to its climax in 1952, when the East-Pakistani police opened fire on students near the Dhaka Medical College protesting for Bengali language to receive equal status with Urdu. The situation was controlled by Nazimuddin who gave a waiver to Bengali language as equal status, a right codified in the 1956 constitution. In 1953 at the instigation of religious parties, anti-Ahmadiyya riots erupted, which led to many Ahmadi deaths. The riots were investigated by a two-member court of inquiry in 1954, which was criticised by the Jamaat-e-Islami, {{one of the parties}} accused of inciting the riots. This event led to the first instance of martial law in the country and began the inroad of military intervention into <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> civilian affairs of the country.|$|E
