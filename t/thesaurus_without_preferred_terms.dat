40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} concept, form {{and length of}} thesaurus <b>preferred</b> <b>terms,</b> four indicators are proposed: 1) percentage of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> designating more than one concept, 2) mean of words per <b>preferred</b> <b>term,</b> 3) percentage of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> with non standard grammatical forms, and 4) percentage of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> with non standard singular and plural forms. A test was carried out on three thesauri, showing nonconformities regarding the four indicators. We conclude that the proposed indicators can be useful for quality evaluation of thesaurus design and development...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{describe}} trainee healthcare professionals’ <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> {{when talking}} about obesity, their beliefs about initiating discussions about weight, and their confidence about consulting with obese people.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{to achieve the}} automatic inheritance of SNOMED CT relations applied to MeSH <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> using UMLS as knowledge source server. We propose an interoperability wildcard to achieve this objective. A quantitative and a qualitative analysis were performed on top four SNOMED CT relations inherited between MeSH <b>preferred</b> <b>terms.</b> A total of 12, 030 couples of MeSH <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> are in relation via at least one SNOMED CT relationship. For the top-four relations inherited between MeSH <b>preferred</b> <b>terms,</b> overall 79. 25 % of them are relevant, 16. 25 % as intermediate and 4. 5 % as irrelevant, as judged by a medical librarian. This work should lead to an optimization of multi-terminology indexing tools, multi-terminology information retrieval and navigation among a multi-terminology server.

5000|$|The first, and oldest, Chinese {{system of}} {{collation}} by semantic field (for instance, [...] "birds" [...] or [...] "fish") {{dates back to}} the ca. 3rd century BCE Erya.

40|$|A brief {{review of}} the rich {{heritage}} of classifications and terminologies is the background for {{a description of the}} Mayo Clinic's clinical terminology development. Vender specific system constraints prompted the scope and style of an interim problem list vocabulary. We describe the sources and review process which led to a working terminology for use in a Computer-based Patient Record (CPR). Because terminology development is often subjective and metrics against which to measure the quality of individual human judgements are few, we decided to compare the selection of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> made by general internists with those made by sub-specialists. A significant difference between a sub-specialist's assignment of <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> and a general internist's (948 vs. 2271, P < 0. 001) was observed. Sub-specialists were less than half as likely as a generalist to designate a <b>term</b> as a <b>preferred</b> form. These results emphasize the need for sub-specialty editing when assigning <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> to concepts...|$|R
