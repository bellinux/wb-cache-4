5|$|The {{idea of a}} multi-scale pattern {{extends back}} to the interwar period in Europe. Early printed {{patterns}} of camouflage, like the 1929 Italian telo mimetico, have larger and smaller elements in <b>the</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung to complement the melody played by the kulintang. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E
5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E

5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> played repetitions and mundane.|$|E
5|$|As {{a coping}} mechanism, self-harm can become psychologically {{addictive}} because, to the self-harmer, it works; it enables {{him or her}} to deal with intense stress in the current moment. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> sometimes created by it, such as specific time intervals between acts of self-harm, can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self-harm.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light.

Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>the</b> burst {{suppression}} <b>pattern</b> {{is characteristic}} of inactivated brains, <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> {{can be used as}} a marker for the level of coma a patient is in, with persistence of <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> commonly associated with poor prognosis. When inducing coma to protect the brain post trauma, <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> assists in maintaining the necessary level of coma so that no further damage occurs to <b>the</b> brain. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> is also used to test the ability of anesthetic arousal agents to induce emergence from comas. <b>The</b> burst suppression <b>pattern</b> can also be used to track ascent into and descent out of hypothermia through observing changes in <b>the</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each pattern repeats after {{a certain}} number of throws, called the period of <b>the</b> <b>pattern.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> is named after the {{shortest}} repeating segment of the sequence, so <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> diagrammed on <b>the</b> right is 53145305520 and has a period of 11. If the period is an odd number, like this one, then each time you repeat the sequence you're starting with the other hand, and <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> is said to be symmetrical because each hand is doing the same thing (although at different times). If the period is an even number then on every repeat of <b>the</b> <b>pattern,</b> each hand does the same thing it did last time and <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> is asymmetrical.|$|R

5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically in reference to <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> in {{the findings from}} both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|The Mint struck pattern {{pieces of}} the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have {{differentiated}} it from the quarter, but <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing Liberty with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|At first glance, dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E

5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). <b>The</b> <b>patterns</b> of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, Georges Cuvier {{published}} his {{findings on the}} differences between living elephants and {{those found in the}} fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual geological processes operating continuously over deep time. In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his geologic map of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated catastrophism to explain <b>the</b> <b>patterns</b> of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record.|$|E
