5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 the Williams family moved to Greenville, Alabama, where Lillie opened a {{boarding}} house next to the Butler County courthouse. In 1935 the Williams family settled in Garland, Alabama, where Lillie Williams opened a new boarding house. After a while they moved with his cousin Opal McNeil to Georgiana, Alabama where Lillie managed to find several side jobs to support her children, despite <b>the</b> <b>bleak</b> economic climate of the Great Depression. She worked in a cannery {{and served as a}} night-shift nurse in the local hospital.|$|E
5|$|Trautmann {{was born}} on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a middle class area in west Bremen, living with his father who worked in a {{fertiliser}} factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. <b>The</b> <b>bleak</b> economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.|$|E

5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting <b>the</b> <b>bleak</b> landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes {{such topics}} as world war, urbanization, the {{alienation}} from nature, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Döblin's experiences during the First World War, when he served in Alsace as a military doctor, left their mark on the novel: psychically damaged veterans, devastated landscapes, and all-destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling. Because of <b>the</b> <b>bleak</b> {{vision of the future}} that the novel presents, it has often been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic, irrationalistic, or regressive work. Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect, in this reading, not Döblin's own world view but instead different historical possibilities, alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and {{claims to be a}} time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing <b>the</b> <b>bleak</b> future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

25|$|Thompson's lyrics {{expressed}} a rather dismal world view, {{and it has}} been suggested that <b>the</b> <b>bleak</b> subject matter of his songs helped to keep his recordings off the hit parade.

25|$|The Carmichael {{family moved}} to Indianapolis in 1916, but Hoagy {{returned}} to Bloomington in 1919 to complete high school. The piano {{was the focus of}} Carmichael's after-school life. For inspiration he would listen to ragtime pianists Hank Wells and Hube Hanna. At eighteen, the small, wiry, and pale Carmichael helped supplement his family’s meager income by working in manual jobs in construction, at a bicycle-chain factory, and in a slaughterhouse. <b>The</b> <b>bleak</b> time was partly spelled by four-handed piano duets with his mother and by his friendship with DuValle, who taught him piano-jazz improvisation. Carmichael earned his first money ($5.00) as a musician playing at a fraternity dance in 1918, marking the beginning of his musical career.|$|E

When his eldest daughters died of consumption in 1825, Maria on 6 May and Elizabeth on 15 June, Charlotte and Emily were immediately brought home. The unexpected deaths distressed the family {{so much that}} Patrick could not face sending them away again. For the next five years, they were educated at home, largely by their father and aunt. The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage, but relied on each other for friendship and companionship. <b>The</b> <b>bleak</b> moors surrounding Haworth became their playground.
