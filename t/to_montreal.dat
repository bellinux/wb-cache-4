5|$|On May 15, Bedel left The Cedars, leaving Butterfield {{in charge}} of the fort. Bedel later claimed that the reason for his {{departure}} was to meet with the friendly Caughnawaga Indians.

He returned <b>to</b> <b>Montreal</b> and reported that a force of 150 British troops of the 8th Foot and about 500Iroquois commanded by Forster was approaching. On this news, Colonel John Paterson sent Major Henry Sherburne with 140men from his regiment toward The Cedars.

5|$|After the Treaty of Ryswick ended {{war between}} the French and English in 1697, the French {{continued}} to make war on the Iroquois (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. The Iroquois sought {{the assistance of the}} English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help. Bellomont and French Governor General Louis-Hector de Callière both claimed dominance over the Iroquois, and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf. When Callière summoned the Iroquois <b>to</b> <b>Montreal</b> for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary <b>to</b> <b>Montreal</b> and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan. The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700.|$|E
