In height, form, and attitudes, he was a model of active, natural, and graceful boyhood. But, while his limbs were so fair in their proportions, they were scarcely muscular; still, every movement exhibited a freedom and ease which announced the grace of childhood, without the smallest evidence of that restraint which creeps into our air as the factitious feelings of later life begin to assert their influence.

The other day, our own country and the United States agreed to refer a point in dispute to the arbitration of the king of Holland; a compliment (if we are to believe the newspapers) of which his majesty was justly proud. He struck a medal on the strength of it, which history will show as a set-off against his less creditable attempts to force his opinions upon the Belgians. Why should not every national dispute be referred, in like manner, to a third party? There is reason to suppose, that the judgment would stand a good chance of being impartial; and it would benefit the character of the judge, and dispose him <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>judgments</b> of the same kind; till at length the custom would prevail, like any other custom; and men be astonished at the customs that preceded it.

50|$|Dweck {{postulated}} {{that children with}} learning goals were believed to approach situations with the goal to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations {{with the goal of}} gaining approval from peers and teachers. Similar to Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation or abbreviated as LGO), seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence in order <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> favorable <b>judgments</b> and avoid negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation. Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation {{to be related to the}} theory of intelligence held by that individual.|$|R

My dissertation looks at human rights violations as being the result of the coordinated efforts of multiple countries to avoid detection and punishment. I utilize game theory to develop a formal model that produces predications that the interaction between potential human rights violators and human rights adjudication bodies revolves around states decisions to coordinate their violation behavior. The first empirical chapter illustrates that states coordinate their violations so as to diminish the likelihood of detection and/or punishment. The second shows that violators who coordinate their violations with other states, especially powerful ones, are more likely <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> a <b>judgment</b> in their favor than violators with fewer and/or weaker allies. The final empirical chapter looks at victims 2 ̆ 7 decisions over whether to bring their complaint before the adjudication body.

Pilot judgment, however, traditionally has been viewed as an intrinsic quality or a by-product of flying experience. Only recently has it been examined as a potential flight-training require-ment.

5000|$|The first {{condition}} of salvation {{is to keep}} the norm of the true faith and in no way to deviate from the established doctrine of the Fathers. For it is impossible that the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, who said, [...] "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church" [...] 16:18, should not be verified. And their truth has been proved by the course of history, for in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has always been kept unsullied. From this hope and faith we by no means desire to be separated and, following the doctrine of the Fathers, we declare anathema all heresies, and, especially, the heretic Nestorius, former bishop of Constantinople, who was condemned by the Council of Ephesus, by Blessed Celestine, bishop of Rome, and by the venerable Cyril, bishop of Alexandria. We likewise condemn and declare to be anathema Eutyches and Dioscoros of Alexandria, who were condemned in the holy Council of Chalcedon, which we follow and endorse. This Council followed the holy Council of Nicaea and preached the apostolic faith. And we condemn the assassin Timothy, surnamed Aelurus Cat" [...] and also Peter Mongos of Alexandria, his disciple and follower in everything. We also declare anathema their helper and follower, Acacius of Constantinople, a bishop once condemned by the Apostolic See, and all those who remain in contact and company with them. Because this Acacius joined himself to their communion, he deserved <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> a <b>judgment</b> of condemnation similar to theirs. Furthermore, we condemn Peter Fuller" [...] of Antioch with all his followers together with the followers of all those mentioned above.Following, as we have said before, the Apostolic See in all things and proclaiming all its decisions, we endorse and approve all the letters which Pope St Leo wrote concerning the Christian religion. And so I hope I may deserve to be associated with you in the one communion which the Apostolic See proclaims, in which the whole, true, and perfect security of the Christian religion resides. I promise that from now on those who are separated from the communion of the Catholic Church, that is, who are not in agreement with the Apostolic See, will not have their names read during the sacred mysteries. But if I attempt even the least deviation from my profession, I admit that, according to my own declaration, I am an accomplice to those whom I have condemned. I have signed this, my profession, with my own hand, and I have directed it to you, Hormisdas, the holy and venerable pope of Rome." ...|$|R

These data evidently demonstrate that the police and court system in Zimbabwe do not consider fire offences seriously like other criminal offences.
