25|$|The {{formalism}} and formulaic {{nature of}} these prayers led them to be written down in language that may have only been partially understood by the writer, and our texts of these prayers {{may in fact be}} garbled. Prayers in Etruscan were used in the Roman world by augurs and other oracles long after Etruscan became a dead language. The Carmen Arvale and the Carmen Saliare are two specimens of partially preserved prayers <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of archaisms and difficult passages.|$|E

25|$|A Celtic mother-goddess nursing one, or {{sometimes}} two, infants, {{is one of}} the most popular Central Gaulish types, though Venus was also very frequently represented in Gaul. The mother-goddess figurines are shown seated in high-backed basketwork chairs <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been typical of Gaul and Britain. Figurines from the Allier Valley and Cologne sources sometimes bear the signatures of modellers and/or mouldmakers. As in the case of the Gaulish samian industries, the makers' names and the styles and themes all illustrate the fusion of local and Mediterranean traditions.|$|E
25|$|The waitoreke {{would be}} most {{remarkable}} if it exists, {{due to the fact}} that New Zealand is one of the few significant land masses on Earth to have no recent native land mammals. The South Pacific nation does play host to several native pinnipeds (seals, sea lions) and bat species (genera Mystacina and Chalinolobus; several extinct genera are known from the earlier Saint Bathans Fauna) but is most notable for its plethora of bird species <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved without the restrictions of mammalian predation: flightless species that would have been fair game for any hunting mammal were most plentiful, and there were even some tiny flightless passerines - a thing almost unheard of, and certainly unknown in the presence of mammalian predators as small as shrews.|$|E
25|$|The Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} 1,884to 1,864million {{years ago when}} the Superior craton was {{surrounded}} by mountain building processes, including the Trans-Hudson, New Quebec and Penokean orogenies. The major Trans-Hudson orogeny had its appearance when the Superior craton collided with the Rae-Hearne craton 1,900to 1,800million years ago. Massive orogenic belts with a change in horizontal direction are represented by the double promontory structure of the Superior craton <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come from the beginning of a rifting event. The New Quebec orogen, also known as the Labrador Trough, lies at the northeastern portion of the Superior craton and is related to ocean closure and collision with the southeastern portion of the Rae craton. At 1,900and 1,800million years ago, an ocean closure and collision with the Wisconian arc terrane resulted {{in the creation of the}} Penokean orogeny at the southern Superior craton margin. The last collision occurred on the southeastern portion of the Superior craton to produce the Grenville orogeny 1,100million years ago.|$|E

25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E
25|$|Lyons {{argues that}} the Constituent Assembly had liberal, rational, and individualistic goals <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been largely {{achieved}} by 1791. However, it failed to consolidate the gains of the Revolution, which continued with increasing momentum and escalating radicalism until 1794. Lyons identifies six reasons for this escalation. First, the king did not accept the limitations on his powers, and mobilised support from foreign monarchs to reverse it. Second, the effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church, sell off its lands, close its monasteries and its charitable operations, {{and replace it with}} an unpopular makeshift system caused deep consternation among the pious and the peasants. Third, the economy was badly hurt by the issuance of ever increasing amounts of paper money (assignats), which caused more and more inflation; the rising prices hurt the urban poor who spent most of their income on food. Fourth, the rural peasants demanded liberation from the heavy system of taxes and dues owed to local landowners. Fifth, the working class of Paris and the other cities—the sans-culottes—resented the fact that the property owners and professionals had taken all the spoils of the Revolution. Finally, foreign powers threatened to overthrow the Revolution, which responded with extremism and systematic violence in its own defence.|$|E
500|$|More vituperation {{followed}} when Pincher's {{allegations of}} Driberg's {{links with the}} Russian secret service were published in 1981; Pincher christened him [...] "Lord of the Spies". However, Foot dismissed these accusations as typical of the [...] "fantasies {{of the secret service}} world <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken possession of Pincher's mind". Foot added that Driberg [...] "had always been much too ready to look forgivingly on Communist misdeeds, but this attitude was combined with an absolutely genuine devotion to the cause of peace".|$|E

500|$|Genuine high-pass {{filters are}} difficult, if not impossible, to {{implement}} with distributed elements. The usual design {{approach is to}} start with a band-pass design, but make the upper stopband occur at a frequency that is so high as to be of no interest. Such filters are described as pseudo-high-pass and the upper stopband is described as a vestigial stopband. Even structures <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an [...] "obvious" [...] high-pass topology, such as the capacitive gap filter of figure 8, turn out to be band-pass when their behaviour for very short wavelengths is considered.|$|E

Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the [...] "greed is good" [...] mentality of the 1980s, and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes [...] "the consumption of popular cultural artefacts", this consumption is [...] "simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix".|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that the film carried a perfect balance of dark humor and psychological drama. [...] "Clooney tackles a far-reaching absurdist fantasy with Barris as a paradigm of paranoia," [...] Travers reviewed.

500|$|Mullum Malarum {{received}} positive reviews upon release. The Name is Rajinikanth (2008) by Gayathri Sreekanth {{states that}} the critics said, [...] "Finally Tamil cinema is coming of age. Movies are getting more visual." [...] A 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu stated that the film [...] "reflects the healthy trend towards a simple short story, vivid picturisation of sylvan scenery, arresting characterisation, catchy folk tunes and picturesque rustic dances <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> caught on among our film producers, {{instead of the usual}} formula of fights, duets, intrigues and cabaret dances... Mahendran has handled the theme deftly. [...] shows his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister." [...] It also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi, and called Balu Mahendra's camera work a [...] "feast for the eyes", noting that although {{the first half of the}} film moves at a [...] "leisurely pace", the second half is [...] "eventful". Ananda Vikatan, in a 3 September 1978 review, praised Mahendran's filmmaking skills in the film, the fact that he told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues, and likened the film to Kurinchi flowers, while rating it 61 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|Steve Palopoli of Metro Silicon Valley said, [...] "Musically, {{the show}} is heavy on the hits, {{although}} considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been handed down {{in regards to the}} music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" [...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion that {{the kind of person who}} goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E
