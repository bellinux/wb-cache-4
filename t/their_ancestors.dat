5|$|When the guecha warriors fought {{battles with}} {{neighbouring}} groups, {{most notably the}} Panche, and also against the Spanish conquistadors, they carried the mummies of <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> on their backs, to impress the enemy and receive fortune in battle.|$|E
5|$|A few kennels {{breeding}} <b>their</b> <b>ancestors,</b> the St. John's water dog, were in England. At {{the same}} time, {{a combination of}} the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom, led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.|$|E

5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> through rituals {{carried out}} {{over the course of}} their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only {{acknowledged}} on that of their marital families. Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a native pony existed in Wales before 1600 BC. The original Welsh Mountain Pony {{is thought to have}} evolved from this prehistoric Celtic pony. Welsh ponies were primarily developed in Wales, and <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> existed in the British Isles prior to the arrival of the Roman Empire. Bands of ponies roamed in a semi-feral state, climbing mountains, leaping ravines, and running over rough moorland terrain.|$|E
5|$|Raynald was {{the younger}} son of Hervé II, Lord of Donzy. In older historiography, Raynald was {{described}} {{as the son of}} Geoffrey, Count of Gien, but in 1989 Jean Richard demonstrated Raynald's kinship with the Lords of Donzy. They were influential noblemen in the Duchy of Burgundy, claiming the Palladii (a family of Roman senators) as <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b>|$|E
50|$|Collation is an {{obligation}} imposed by law on all descendants {{who wish to}} share as heirs in the estate of <b>their</b> <b>ancestor,</b> either by will or on intestacy.

5|$|The Al Khalifa {{family moved}} from Qatar to Bahrain in 1799. Originally, <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> were {{expelled}} from Umm Qasr in central Arabia by the Ottomans {{due to their}} predatory habits of preying on caravans in Basra and trading ships in Shatt al-Arab waterway until Turks expelled them to Kuwait in 1716, where they remained until 1766.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian bow is {{a fairly}} long, {{approximately}} symmetrical, composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its shape is known from two graves in which {{the position of the}} bone plates could be reconstructed. Modern Hungarians have attempted to reconstruct the composite bows of <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> and have revived mounted archery as a competitive sport.|$|E
5|$|The Nohgaku Performers' Association (Nōgaku Kyōkai), {{to which}} all {{professionals}} are registered, strictly protects the traditions passed down from <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> (see iemoto). However, several secret documents of the Kanze school written by Zeami, as well as materials by Konparu Zenchiku, have been diffused throughout the community of scholars of Japanese theatre.|$|E

5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b> They were able to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> lived across New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversity}} of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural {{tradition and the}} individuality of the monuments support {{the argument that the}} monuments represent individual rulers. The monuments may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of the region as a depiction of both rulership and <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} Korean clans that are descended from such intermarriages. For example, the Deoksu Jang clan, {{claiming}} some 30,000 Korean members, views Jang Sunnyong, a Central Asian who married a Korean female, as <b>their</b> <b>ancestor.</b> Another clan, Gyeongju Seol, claiming at least 2,000 members in Korea, view a Central Asian (probably an Uyghur) named Seol Son as <b>their</b> <b>ancestor.</b>|$|R

5|$|The highly {{specialised}} Manche production {{methods for}} annatto, cacao and vanilla were {{adopted by the}} incoming Q'eqchi' and are still applied on a small scale.

5|$|There {{are a few}} {{types of}} {{existing}} bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms and tunicates. It has not been definitively established whether {{the existence of these}} brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E
5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of <b>their</b> <b>ancestors,</b> the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> in documents, they never go earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also {{the name of the father}} of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll in the third quarter of the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E
