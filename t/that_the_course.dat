5|$|In October 1990, Tech {{opened its}} first {{overseas}} campus, Georgia Tech Lorraine (GTL). A non-profit corporation operating under French law, GTL primarily focuses on graduate education, sponsored research, and an undergraduate summer program. In 1997 GTL was sued {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> descriptions on its internet site did not comply with the Toubon Law, which requires that advertisements must be provided in French. The case was dismissed on a technicality; the GTL site subsequently offers course descriptions in English, French and German.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Ornais and Dooneys Gate both {{suffered}} fatal {{falls on}} the first circuit. Ornais incurred a cervical fracture at the fourth fence (a plain 4ft 10-inch obstacle) and Dooneys Gate fractured his thoracolumbar at fence six (the 5ft Becher's Brook). Aintree had made significant modifications to its National Course in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race – <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered by a tarpaulin on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to Dooneys Gate. This {{was the first time}} since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences were jumped.|$|E

5|$|Vasey slowly recovered. In October 1944, Blamey {{set up a}} Post-War Army Planning Committee {{headed by}} Vasey {{to report on the}} future of the Royal Military College and the {{training}} and education of Staff Corps officers. Vasey called for a greatly expanded regular army of 20,000 men. His report recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> at Duntroon be deepened professionally and academically to the level of an undergraduate university degree. The report's recommendations were not accepted or welcomed by the government but pointed the way to the future, in which the Army would become increasingly professional. In February 1945, Frank Forde pressed for Vasey to be given another active command. Blamey, who still had doubts about Vasey's physical fitness despite Vasey being given an A by an Army medical board, reluctantly appointed him to command the 6th Division, then in action in the Aitape-Wewak campaign.|$|E
25|$|One {{negative}} {{criticism of}} the novel was made by a reviewer who {{thought that there was}} an assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of history would have gone pretty much as it did with Native Americans here, and felt that this underestimates the impact of Native Americans on our history.|$|E
25|$|The entries {{were limited}} to four in each event (Coxed Fours and Double Sculls); two from abroad and two from the UK.

40|$|Colleges and {{universities}} across the U. S. are offering online Earth system science courses for K- 12 teachers through NASA's ESSEA program. The three available courses-for teachers of grades K- 4, 5 - 8, and 9 - 12 -are delivered online and feature student-centered, knowledge-building virtual communities. <b>The</b> <b>courses</b> were developed for NASA within the Center for Educational Technologies (CET) at Wheeling Jesuit University. The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and CET managed ESSEA through NASA funding. Twenty participating colleges, universities, and education organizations were competitively selected to receive funding {{and training for}} running <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> and continuing support from IGES and CET. From 2000 - 2006, 1, 707 teachers from across the U. S. completed a semester or quarter long ESSEA course {{from one of the}} participating institutions.

25|$|The annual Berlin Marathon, {{which takes}} place in the last weekend of September, was first held in 1974 but due to the {{division}} of the city was confined to West Berlin up till and including 1989. Beginning in 1990 the course was re-routed into part of East Berlin, and in 2001 a further adjustment meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> has since run through Potsdamer Platz.

25|$|Anquetil {{was fascinated}} by the British love of time-trialling and in 1964 {{discussed}} riding a British 25mile (40km) race. Gayfer and the British professional Tom Simpson explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> would be on flat roads and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who had the talent to predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the distance had ever been ridden, the record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.|$|E
25|$|When {{the start}} and finish {{positions}} of the Old Course had become established, {{the distance between them}} was found to be 1 mile 570 yds (2131 metres). However, boats were aligned by their sterns at {{the start and}} judged by their bows at the finish. This meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> was slightly longer for single sculls than for eights. The length of an eight was assumed to be twenty yards and as such the course came to be described as ‘about 1 mile and 550 yards (2112 metres)’, which was the distance covered by an eight.|$|E

The Government of India responded by stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> was not compulsory, but optional and several western universities allow astrology as a course choice. It sought dismissal of the case stating that the petitioners' concerns were unfounded. The Supreme Court dismissed the case on 5 May 2004.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, a Single Sculls Event {{was added}} {{and the start}} was moved to Fawley so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> was closer to 1000m. As the {{intermediate}} start installations were required for the shorter distance, the races had to take place during intervals in the normal racing programme (the lunch or tea breaks) which meant that only the dedicated stayed to watch. This was a pity, since {{the final of the}} Women's Invitation Single was a highlight of the regatta, with Beryl Mitchell of Thames Tradesmen’s Rowing Club (World Silver medallist in 1981) beating Stephanie Foster of Waiariki Rowing Club, New Zealand (World Bronze medallist in 1982) by one length. Astrid Ayling was also able to race legitimately, winning the Invitation Double Sculls event with Rosie Clugston.|$|E
25|$|In April 1900, {{surveyors}} {{began studying}} {{part of the}} park as a possible location for a golf course. Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> would open in June or July of that year, but that the work would not be fully complete until September. New York City greenskeeper Val Flood later stated that he thought the course would open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started {{due to a lack}} of workers. By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created. The course opened in 1901, but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead.|$|E
