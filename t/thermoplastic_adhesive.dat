In order to pursue this trend, it is important to carry out research and innovation on new polymer-based materials, with a high structural performance to weight ratio to replace standard materials, such as mild steel, for structural components. The base costs of composite materials are still relatively too high, therefore research activities are needed to reduce manufacturing costs of composite components.

40|$|Wood {{is often}} {{combined}} with other materials such as <b>thermoplastics,</b> <b>adhesives</b> and coatings. In general, combinations of wood and polymers especially in outdoor exposure have poor long-term durability. This behaviour {{can be related to}} an insufficient wood-polymer adhesion due to the low intrinsic compatibility between the wood substance and the polymers used. Another source for woodpolymer de-bonding is the high hygroscopicity of wood and great difference in hygro-thermal properties between the components. The basic conceptual idea related to this work is to reduce the hygrosensitivity of wood by applying different wood modification methods, in particular, acetylation, furfurylation and heat treatment. The effects of such chemical modifications of wood, also accompanied with ageing effects, on its adhesion properties with commonly used synthetic polymers are, however, not well understood. In this context, the over-all purpose of this thesis is to achieve a better understanding of wood-polymer adhesion and interfacial forces which also may guide us to tailor the interaction between modified wood and e. g. <b>thermoplastics</b> and <b>adhesives.</b> The main focus of this thesis is therefore to apply contact angle analysis based on the Chang-Qin-Chen (CQC) Lewis acid-base model in order to estimate the work of adhesion (Wa) between the wood, modified wood and certain polymers. Contact angle measurements on wood samples were performed based on the Wilhelm plate principle. Related to this, an effort was also made to characterize the studied modified wood surfaces according to morphology and chemical composition. The methods that have been used are low vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LV-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Results show that so-called interaction parameters can be successfully estimated for prediction of Wa between wood and polymers using the applied CQC model. Furthermore, such wetting analysis was successfully related to spectroscopic findings of the chemical composition of the wood samples surface. Ageing effects, i. e. the time after preparation of the wood surface, play a central role for the surface characteristics. In most cases, ageing resulted in a significant decrease of Wa between wood and water and a moderate decrease between wood and thermoplastics. The surface characteristics of acetylated wood were, however, more stable over time compared to unmodified, furfurylated and heat treated wood. The predicted Wa with the adhesives for heat treated and acetylated wood was increased due to ageing. Future work is planned to involve studies in order to relate such predicted adhesion properties with the actual performance of various wood-polymer systems. QC 2010110...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the residual stress and its effects on thermoplastic bonding to metals. Thermoplastic adhesives have the potential to become important in bonding various materials. Residual stresses can occur in a thermoplastic bonded system due to the deferential material properties between adherend and adhesive such as thermal expansion and viscoelastic property. ^ In bonding a thermoplastic to metal, residual stresses in the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> are generated during cooling down the thermoplastic-metal joint. An initial slow cooling (∼ 4. 5 °C/minute) to ∼ 210 °C followed by a fast cooling (∼ 30 °C/second) of PEEK, a semi-crystalline polymer, resulted in a ∼ 52 % increase in residual stress compared to a cycle with only fast cooling. For PEI, an amorphous polymer, fast cooling during glass transition produced ∼ 15 % higher residual stress than slow cooling. A mechanics based curvature model, combined with the elasticity and viscoelasticity of thermoplastics, predicted the residual stress development. ^ The residual stresses were further studied with a thermoplastic-metal cylindrical configuration. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was injection-molded around a metal rod and a joint assembly was created during the cooling. The in-process residual stresses were visualized using plane polariscope. Slitting and strain gage techniques were used along with a FEM model to measure and interpret the circumferential residual stress at ∼ 5 MPa in the PMMA ring. Two methods, water soaking and slitting, reduced the residual stresses. ^ Environmental stress cracking of the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>adhesive</b> was revealed in this study. Combination of experimental observation and a FEM model demonstrated that the surface roughness of the adherend can induce stress concentration at the interface. The stress concentration was shown to be a significant cause of the adhesive environmental cracking. ^ For two new thermoplastic and thermosetting adhesives, Bemis 6343 and FM 300 - 2, preliminary fracture studies were carried out. As the loading speed of the Bemis 6343 DCB increased from 2. 5 mm/minute to 381. 0 mm/minute, the fracture toughness increased from ∼ 2000 J/m 2 to ∼ 4000 J/m 2. Fiber additives stabilized the fracture propagation of the FM 300 - 2 DCBs. ...|$|E
