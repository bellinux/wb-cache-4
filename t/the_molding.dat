5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
25|$|Bakelite's {{molding process}} {{had a number}} of advantages. Bakelite resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cycle, but could be removed from <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> process without being cooled, again making <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the fusible core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. <b>The</b> <b>molding</b> is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> in a hot bath.|$|E
40|$|Cu– 4. 7 wt. % Sn {{alloy wire}} with Ø 10 mm was {{prepared}} by two-phase zone continuous casting technology, {{and the temperature}} field, heat and fluid flow were investigated by the numerical simulated method. As <b>the</b> melting temperature, <b>mold</b> temperature, continuous casting speed and cooling water temperature is 1200 °C, 1040 °C, 20 mm/min and 18 °C, respectively, the alloy temperature in <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is in <b>the</b> range of 720 °C– 1081 °C, and the solid/liquid interface is in <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> In <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> <b>the</b> heat flow direction is vertically downward. At the upper wall of <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> <b>the</b> heat flow direction is obliquely downward and deflects toward <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> and at <b>the</b> lower wall of <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> <b>the</b> heat flow deflects toward the alloy. There is a complex circular flow in <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Liquid alloy flows downward along the wall of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and flows upward in the center...|$|R
50|$|For {{surfaces}} of the casting that are perpendicular to the parting line of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> a draft must be included. This is so that the casting can be released in non-expendable processes or the pattern can be released from <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> without destroying <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> in expendable processes. The required draft angle depends on {{the size and shape}} of the feature, the depth of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cavity, how <b>the</b> part or pattern is being removed from <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> <b>the</b> pattern or part material, <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> material, and <b>the</b> process type. Usually the draft is not less than 1%.|$|R

25|$|The process {{consists}} of three major steps: casting or molding a core, inserting the core into the mold and shooting the mold, and finally removing <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> and melting out the core.|$|E
25|$|Evaporative-pattern casting {{is a type}} {{of casting}} process that uses a pattern made from a {{material}} that will evaporate when the molten metal is poured into <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity. The most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.|$|E
25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. <b>The</b> <b>molding</b> sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{molding process}} of {{aluminum}} foams {{by using a}} rotating mold is proposed {{in order to improve}} <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> filling and forming process for light-weight parts of vehicles. Aluminum powder mixed with a foaming agent is extruded into <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> through <b>the</b> die heated to a temperature higher than the melting point, and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is filled with the aluminum foam. When the diameter of a cylindrical <b>mold</b> is large, <b>the</b> influence of gravity is significant and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is not filled successfully. In <b>the</b> proposed <b>molding,</b> <b>the</b> aluminum foam is extruded into <b>the</b> rotating <b>mold</b> of large diameter and the volumetric ratio of foam to mold cavity is improved. However, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> rotation on <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> filling is limited due to friction...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{compression}} <b>molding</b> starts, with an allotted {{amount of}} plastic or gelatin placed over or inserted into a <b>mold.</b> Afterward <b>the</b> material is heated to a pliable state in and by <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Shortly there after the hydraulic press compresses the pliable plastic against <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> {{resulting in a}} perfectly <b>molded</b> piece, retaining <b>the</b> shape of the inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> After <b>the</b> hydraulic press releases, an ejector pin {{in the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> quickly ejects <b>the</b> finished piece out of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and then <b>the</b> process is finished. Depending on the type of plunger used in the press, there will or won't be excess material on <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compression molding: The plastic is {{generally}} preheated is placed into a heated metal mold cavity and pressure {{is applied to}} force the plastic to contract and take the shape of <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Heat and pressure is kept until the plastic cures <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> <b>The</b> excess plastic is cut away and removed from <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Disadvantages to compression mold include varying product consistency and flashing, which is excess material attached to <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> part {{that needs to be}} removed where two or more parts of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> meet.|$|R
25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from <b>the</b> <b>molding.</b> This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages <b>the</b> <b>molding.</b> In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the hot bath via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of defect is metal penetration, which occurs when the liquid metal penetrates into <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> sand. This causes a rough surface finish. This is caused by sand {{particles}} which are too coarse, lack of mold wash, or pouring temperatures that are too high. An alternative form of metal penetration into the mould known as veining is caused by cracking of the sand.|$|E
25|$|The Plymouths {{were not}} as promotionally {{sophisticated}} at PMC's Chevys. Though the models were handsome, original manufacturers' paints were not applied, there were no interiors, and <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> and detail {{were not as}} precise. For, example, the car's bumpers {{were a part of}} the overall body molding. Perhaps the Plymouths represent a natural blend in product ideology between the more toy-like IH offerings and the serious promoting that was to come with Chevrolet.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short <b>mold</b> life. <b>The</b> high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> life is dependent on four factors: <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> material, <b>the</b> pouring temperature, <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> temperature, and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> configuration. Molds made from gray cast iron can be more economical to produce but have short <b>mold</b> lives. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>molds</b> made from H13 tool steel may have a mold life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature <b>the</b> shorter <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> temperature is too low misruns are produced, but if <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and mold erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> or casting can decrease mold life as well.|$|R
50|$|Advantages {{are high}} {{achievable}} temperatures, independent from the conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and independent {{from heat and}} pressure. Main disadvantage is {{the time that it}} takes to heat up <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> It takes relatively long for heat transfer to take place from the furnace atmosphere to <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> surface and subsequently throughout the cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{commercial use}} of Bakelite in the electrical industry was <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> of tiny insulating bushings {{the size of}} mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.|$|E
25|$|As {{with metal}} casting and stereotyping, a mold is first formed from the model. Since {{electrotyping}} involves wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> material can be soft. Materials such as wax, gutta-percha (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine graphite powder or paint. A wire {{is attached to}} the conducting surface, and the mold is suspended in an electrolyte solution.|$|E
25|$|Undercuts on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} undercuts, where external undercuts are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior undercuts are {{on the inside of the}} part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> machine.|$|E
50|$|The {{gravity process}} begins by {{preheating}} <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> to 150-200 °C (300-400 °F) {{to ease the}} flow and reduce thermal damage to <b>the</b> casting. <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> cavity is then coated with a refractory material or a mold wash, which prevents the casting from sticking to <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and prolongs <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> life. Any sand or metal cores are then installed and <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is clamped shut. Molten metal is then poured into <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Soon after solidification <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> is opened and the casting removed to reduce chances of hot tears. The process is then started all over again, but preheating is not required because {{the heat from the}} previous casting is adequate and the refractory coating should last several castings. Because this process is usually carried out on large production run work-pieces automated equipment is used to coat <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> pour <b>the</b> metal, and remove the casting.|$|R

25|$|Pottery making can {{be found}} {{in many parts of the}} state, but the two best-known centers are San Bartolo Coyotepec and Santa Maria Atzompa. Most of Oaxaca’s pottery is made without potters’ wheels, instead done with the use of molds or formed by hand, {{sometimes}} using a kind of “proto-wheel”, which is a plate or shallow bowl place over an inverted bowl. Ceramics are one of Oaxaca’s best known handcrafts in Mexico. The most common glazed pieces include those with base colors of brown and white, shaped into vases, plates, cups and decorative pieces. For utilitarian pieces, molds are most commonly used. For very large pieces such as cantaros other storage containers, <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> is done in sections.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the stenciling, de Forest's touch {{can be seen in}} the incorporation of other Eastern designs and Tiffany glass. De Forest used carved teakwood, like that produced by the Ahmedabad Woodcarving Company, in <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> along the outer edge of the fireplace in Mamie Gwinn's study, as well as some picture frames in the corridor between her and Thomas's study (the Blue Room). In the third expansion of the house in 1908, de Forest decorated the ceiling of the Dorothy Vernon Room with thin sheets of patterned brass in a variety of East Indian designs. Several of the rooms also included Tiffany glass lamps or fixtures that were designed by de Forest and created in the Tiffany Studios.|$|E

25|$|The communion {{table is}} the oldest {{in the state and}} is of {{undoubtedly}} an original feature of this church. It is a walnut table with dimension of 65 inches × 30”. It has baluster-like, robust legs and a bottom rail on all four sides. <b>The</b> <b>molding</b> of the edge of the upper rail is a reversed S (cyma reversa). Reportedly it was used as a chopping block by an American patrol during the War of 1812, and it shows a documented disregard of the sacerdotal nature of communion tables in early American churches cited by Upton as including: use as a desk for in-church schools, use as a hat table, instances of their being “pushed around carelessly,” going so far that stray dogs stole the communion bread and even urinated on the table legs. Hence, regulations were passed that the table in each church must be located on the east wall and that a protective rail be erected around it. The use of any church as a school, in particular, is puzzling because most colonial vestries scrupulously avoided using the church even for parish business, meeting in a separate vestry house close by a church or in the room formed by bell towers such as at St. Peter’s, New Kent County. The vestry house for this church remained as a ruin just outside the west wall until 1820.|$|E
25|$|The iconostasis {{underwent}} {{its first}} renovation {{when the church}} building was extended in 1868. According to the restorers' report, only the icons of the first tier and the holy doors were repainted at the time. The heavier use of this tier and the doors might have influenced the repainting but during the renovation signs of fire damage were also discovered. The first restoration therefore probably aimed to conceal the damage. A few years later, in the mid 1870s the entire iconostasis was renovated. After the lateral aisles {{were added to the}} church, the parish decided to reshape the interior of the building. For this purpose they had to dismount the icons from the frame. The icons and their framework were renewed under the supervision of György Révész. Gyula Petrovics, a painter, and Károly Müller, a gilder, worked in his restoration team. They did not change the composition of the icons or paint them over. Minor modifications were found only on some of the images of the first, so-called Feasts tier. Révész's team worked with oil paint which was covered by a layer of varnish. The varnish first turned yellow, and later giving the original colors a darker, matte appearance. The framework of the iconostasis was marbleized. The coloring of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> and the fundamental elements of the wooden frame resembled gray marble, while the pilasters and the columns were painted to resemble blue marble. This pattern was also adopted {{for the rest of the}} church's furniture, except for the red-ocher altar table.|$|E
