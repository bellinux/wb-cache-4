5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
500|$|Playwright Horton Foote {{reportedly}} considered {{giving up}} on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, {{under the condition that}} he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, [...] "I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.... It is always a collaborative effort.... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them." [...] This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write Tender Mercies, his first work written specifically for the screen. In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected [...] "Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films." ...|$|E

2500|$|The novel sparked {{discussion}} {{over the}} use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has “received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,” while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body’s appearance. [...] Westerfeld has theorized that “having extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> member of the privileged class." [...] Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he “wouldn’t hesitate [...] if he had a kid with port-wine stain. We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.” Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous.|$|E
2500|$|Band vocalist and {{songwriter}} Ichiro Yamaguchi had difficulty finalising [...] "Endless", feeling {{dissatisfied with the}} lyrics. He felt that releasing music {{was an act of}} pointing at yourself; stating to everyone <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> certain type of person. Considering this, he wanted to create a song that directly reflected his inner feelings perfectly, but felt that he needed new lyrical techniques to do so. Yamaguchi felt as if he relied on his pre-existing lyrical techniques such as wordplay, the lyrics would not truly express his ideas. Eventually, he rewrote the song 74 times, creating a total of 78 different versions of the song lyrics. While Yamaguchi struggled actualising [...] "Endless", the band worked on the other compositions included in Documentaly, returning to [...] "Endless" [...] each time. Yamaguchi focused on [...] "Endless", acting as the driving force for the song's creation, and had little input on the production of the other songs on Documentaly. He felt that the song's [...] "groove" [...] was an extremely important part of the song, so discussed the song at length with the band's drummer Keiichi Ejima. Yamaguchi utilised a technique where he slowly added a progression of instruments to the song, which he believed would control the emotional sentiment. During the trial and error process, Yamaguchi removed an entire section of the song's melody, {{in order to make the}} composition simpler.|$|E

2500|$|Cuzzoni's {{arrival in}} the English capital was keenly {{anticipated}} in the press. Though the [...] "London Journal" [...] for 27 October 1722 reported that [...] "Mrs. Cotsona , an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily", she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel's Ottone at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> real she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, me, that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and was silly and fantastical." ...|$|E
