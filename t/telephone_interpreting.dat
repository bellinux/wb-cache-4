40|$|This report {{looks at}} the qualitative {{findings}} about the information-seeking behaviour of today’s college graduates as they {{transition from the}} campus to the workplace.   Included are findings from interviews with 23 US employers and focus groups with 33 recent graduates from four US colleges and universities, conducted as an exploratory study for Project Information Literacy’s (PIL’s) Passage Studies. Most graduates in our focus groups said they {{found it difficult to}} solve information problems in the workplace, where unlike college, a sense of urgency pervaded and where personal contacts often reaped more useful results than online searches. Graduates said they leveraged essential information competencies from college for extracting content and also developed adaptive information-seeking strategies for reaching out to trusted colleagues in order to compensate for what they lacked. At the same time, employers said they recruited graduates, in part, for their online searching skills but still expected and needed more traditional research competencies, such as thumbing through bound reports, picking up the <b>telephone,</b> and <b>interpreting</b> research results with team members. They found that their college hires rarely demonstrated these competencies. Overall, our findings suggest there is a distinct difference between today’s graduates who demonstrated how quickly they found answers online and seasoned employers who needed college hires to use a combination of online and traditional methods to conduct comprehensive research...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{automatic}} {{spoken language}} interpretation (synonymous names sometimes {{used for the}} same subject area include speech or speech-to-speech translation, automatic <b>telephone</b> interpretation and <b>interpreting</b> telephony) aims at {{the development of new}} and advanced information processing techniques that will allow speakers of different languages to converse with one another in their own respective mother tongue via a (stationary or mobile) computer system that automatically translates their speech utterances. The constituent technologies required for such a system include automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker adaptation (SpA) at the input side, machine translation (MT) for the actual transfer of meaning between the source and the target language(s), and finally speech synthesis (SS) and voice conversion (VC) to generate the appropriate speech output in the target language(s). Albeit commercial systems that perform these various tasks already exist, mere concatenation of these modules (however well they may perform on their own in conventional applications) is not enough to provide for fully functional speech translation.

40|$|Advanced and {{affordable}} video conferencing technology {{has led to}} an increase in remote interpreting services via video, which has become a significant alternative to <b>telephone</b> and face-to-face <b>interpreting.</b> In keeping with this development, training providers are now incorporating video conference interpreting in their training. Video and audio resources are also increasingly being used as e-learning resources in online learning tools such as Blackboard and other university student learning portals. This has implications for the testing of interpreting skills, and the RMIT University Translating and Interpreting Program in Melbourne, Australia has started phasing in video assessment in examination and accreditation tests. In Australia, three test modes are commonly used: audio, video, and live-simulated tests. This article reports on a small-scale study that compared the three testing modes in terms of their potential impact on student examination results and also in terms of testing efficiency for training providers. Due to a lack of relevant research on the topic in the interpreting discipline, the discussion draws on relevant studies in diverse fields such as applied psychology, behavioral science, and musical performance. This study has implications for interpreter training strategies, for designing and administering interpreter assessment tests, and for resourcing in training programs...|$|R

A quantitative survey is conducted to reveal the annual production, the distribution of articles in different journals and active researchers of the field. More in-depth qualitative analysis is also done over the content and citation sources of the articles in order to examine distribution of research themes and topics, research methods and theoretical sources. It is found that the total publication of this period is comparable to 53. 5 % of the previous five decades. Their research themes range from interpreter training to theoretical issues, interpreting techniques and issues in-practice, interpreting product, interpreting process and community, <b>telephone</b> and sign-language <b>interpreting.</b> Their research methods include theoretical conceptualization, literature analysis and review, theory-application analysis, summary and-reflection of experiences, experimental studies, survey studies and observational studies. It is concluded from the bibliometrical analysis that new progress has been achieved in interpreting studies in China during the past five years, which is evident in more wide-ranging research themes and topics, more diversified theoretical sources and better utilization of methodology. The bibliometrical analysis also indicates {{the emergence of a new}} generation of researchers, who are expected to take interpreting studies to a new height with favorable institutional and academic environment in place in China.

40|$|Background Better {{understanding}} of the demographic distribution of epilepsy and the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in community-based settings would improve our {{understanding of}} this disorder at the population level. Although we now have good estimates of epilepsy prevalence for most countries, we still lack knowledge on its demographic distribution by age, ethnicity, region, and socioeconomic status. In addition, no studies to date have reported the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes using patient interview outside a hospital setting. This thesis provides the first community-based estimates of the prevalence {{of the most common}} clinical group of epilepsies presumed to have a genetic basis - The Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsies (IGE) - by patient and witness interview. Methods This thesis has involved conducting five pieces of new research: (i) a series of reviews and analyses of descriptive data on epilepsy prevalence, particularly focusing on the critical methodological issues of ascertainment, diagnosis and classification of epilepsy for epidemiological purposes; (ii) the validation of a modified diagnostic epilepsy questionnaire adapted for administration in population studies; (iii) recruitment of a community-based cohort - The Tasmanian Epilepsy Register (TER) - through the Australian national prescription database; (iv) estimation of the overall prevalence and distribution of self-reported treated epilepsy in Tasmania by imputation methods; (v) estimation of the prevalence and distribution of IGE in Tasmania by telephone interviewing. Results My modified diagnostic questionnaire, administered by <b>telephone</b> interviewing and <b>interpreted</b> with standardized guidelines, demonstrated excellent agreement with an epilepsy specialist's clinical assessment in diagnosing the presence of epilepsy (K = 0. 94), seizure-onset types (K = 0. 84), simple or complex partial seizures (K= 0. 87), any generalized non-convulsive seizure (K= 0. 82), and IGE (K = 0. 82). A lthough stil l substantial, agreement was not as close for secondarily general ized seizures (K = 0. 74), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (K = 0. 79). 7541 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the preceding year in Tasman ia were eligible for recruitment through the Australian national prescription database. After three mail contacts, 54. 0 % responded, with 43. 6 % who indicated treatment for epilepsy representing 86. 0 % of total possible epilepsy cases by imputation (n= 2063) in Tasmania. 1180 {{agreed to participate in the}} TER, 90. 0 % of participants received their AEDs either exclusively from their general practitioner (70. 9 %) or in combination with a medical specialist (19. 1 %) in the preceding twelve months. The adjusted treated epilepsy prevalence was 4. 36 per 1000 (95 % CI 4. 34, 4. 39); this was: lower in women (prevalence ratio 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 84, 1. 00); greater with increasing age (p< 0. 001); similar in the three main geographical regions; and similar by categories of socioeconomic status based on postcode of residence. Following enrolment, 959 / 1083 (88. 6 %) eligible TER participants completed the diagnostic telephone interviewing, with partial epilepsy classified in two thirds, and generalised epilepsy in slightly more than one-fifth. IGE was observed in 20. 3 %, with tonic-clonic seizures (17. 03 %) and the absence epilepsies combined (11. 01 %) being the most common IGE seizure types and syndromes respectively. The estimated prevalence of IGE was 0. 89 per 1000; is highest between the ages of 20 - 39 years and in females, but was similar between Tasmanian regions and socio-economic groups. IGE prevalence beyond childhood related to refractory childhood or adolescent disease rather than olderonset cases, and was characterised by the presence of myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Generalised seizures, but not IGE, were less prevalent in southern Tasmania. Conclusions Utilising the design approach described in this thesis may provide an alternative to neurological assessment, and when coupled with case ascertainment through prescription data, can provide a valid estimate of the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in countries with high access to health services. The observed pattern of high elderly epilepsy prevalence, is similar to patterns in recent studies in other developed countries, and has important implications for future planning of health services in these countries. IGE represents a considerable proportion of community-treated disease with important aetiological and prognostic determinants occurring at the seizure rather than syndrome level of classification...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} examines {{the perspectives of}} New Zealand-based telephone interpreters on the challenges they encounter at work. <b>Telephone</b> <b>interpreting,</b> as {{a new form of}} interpreting, is growing at a fast pace around the world and has been used widely in many different social service settings. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the status quo of <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> services and the difficulties interpreters face. To the best of my knowledge, no research has been conducted in respect of <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> in New Zealand. The purpose of this study was to identify problems faced by telephone interpreters in New Zealand and provide possible solutions to address these difficulties through interpreter training and/or on-going professional development. The findings were based on a mixed method research study with a quantitative online survey and qualitative interviews. A total of 21 telephone interpreters participated in the survey and 9 telephone interpreters volunteered to be interviewed. The results indicated that for telephone interpreters in New Zealand the main challenges included a lack of information for preparation, the absence of visual messages and the difficulties of communicating with other parties (e. g. using direct/indirect speech, controlling turn-taking, interrupting the speakers, asking for clarification, avoiding side-talk and explaining the interpreter’s role). Additional challenges also included work stress, interpreters feeling isolated during interpreting work, the relatively low remuneration and the issues of work-life balance. The participants had developed, through their work experiences, their own strategies to deal with the problems stated above. According to the findings, most respondents in this research had participated in some form of interpreter training and had thought highly of such programmes. However, as the training they had had was on general interpreting, several respondents suggested it would be better to have training specifically on <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting.</b> The study suggests that both interpreting education and on-going professional development, specifically through the accumulation of work experience, are important for telephone interpreters. It is also indicated that users of <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> services play an important part in <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> communication. If <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> users are educated on how to work with telephone interpreters, the communication will be more effective and efficient. Furthermore, it is also suggested that <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> providers develop a system on gathering feedback from users to help interpreters improve their performance. Telephone interpreters also need an open policy from employers regarding whether their interpreting performance will affect the employers’ prioritization of interpreters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looks at}} the fast growing but vastly under-researched area of <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> (henceforth TI), {{within the context of}} the radical changes in {{telephony}} in recent decades. It examines what has been established in our knowledge of the TI field and where further research is needed, both for technological issues but perhaps even more pertinently for practice issues. The scattered research effort so far has given us a patchy picture of TI, with inconsistent or uncertain findings on basic questions such as how interpreters and other participants coordinate discourse via telephone, or the use of first or third person, as well as more technical issues of the extent of use of mobile vs. fixed-line phones, or which set-ups of TI are most effective. The research effort is hampered by abiding stereotypes of TI as an inferior form of interpreting, and by the lack of a theoretical basis for further exploration. Suggestions are made for starting points methodologically and theoretically to address such shortcomings. Few areas of interpreting have seen the radical impact of technology as much as has <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting.</b> From a generally small and somewhat marginalised part i...|$|E

40|$|Interpreter {{profession}} is currently changing: migration flows, {{the economic crisis}} and the fast development of ICTs brought unexpected changes in our societies and in traditional interpreting services all over. Remote interpreting (RI), which entails new methods such as videoconference interpreting and <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> (TI), has greatly developed and now sees interpreters working remotely and being connected to service users via videoconference set up or telephone calls. This dissertation aims at studying and analyzing the relevant aspects of interpreter-mediated telephone calls, describing the consequences for the interpreters in this new working field, as well as defining new strategies and techniques interpreters must develop in order {{to adjust to the}} new working context. For these purposes, the objectives of this dissertation are the following: to describe the settings in which RI is mostly used, to study the prominent consequences on interpreters and analyze real interpreter-mediated conversations. The dissertation deals with issues studied by the Shift project, a European project which aims at creating teaching materials for remote interpreting; the project started in 2015 and the University of Bologna and in particular the DIT - Department of Interpreting and Translation is the coordinating unit and promoting partner. This dissertation is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 contains an outline of the major research related to RI and videoconference interpreting as well as a description of its main settings: healthcare, law, business economics and institution. Chapter 2 focuses on the physiological and psychological implications for interpreters working on RI. The concepts of absence, presence and remoteness are discussed; some opinions of professional interpreters and legal practitioners (LPs) concerning remote interpreting are offered as well. In chapter 3, <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> is presented; basic concepts of conversational analysis and prominent traits of interpreter-mediated calls are also explored. Chapter 4 presents the materials and methodology used for the analysis of data. The results, discussed in Chapter 5, show that <b>telephone</b> <b>interpreting</b> may be suitable for some specific contexts; however, it is clear that interpreters must get appropriate training before working in any form of RI. The dissertation finally offers suggestions for the implementation of training in RI for future interpreting students...|$|E
