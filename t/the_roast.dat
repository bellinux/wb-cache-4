On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh in her face. Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E

5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After <b>the</b> <b>roast,</b> Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
50|$|A {{roasting}} rack may be {{an accessory}} part of <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> pan. A rack may be horizontal and lay flat on <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> pan, {{or it may be}} a standing rack that sits vertically in the pan. A standing rack is most commonly used for roasting poultry. A variation of <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> pan standing rack is the beer can chicken recipe.|$|R
50|$|Hōjicha infusions have a light- to reddish-brown {{appearance}} {{and are less}} astringent due to losing catechins during <b>the</b> high-temperature <b>roasting</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>roasted</b> flavors are extracted and dominate this tea: <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> replaces <b>the</b> vegetative tones of other varieties of Japanese green tea with a toasty, slightly caramel-like flavor. <b>The</b> <b>roasting</b> process used to make Hōjicha also lowers the amount of caffeine in the tea. Because of its mildness, Hōjicha is a popular tea to serve during the evening meal or after, before going to sleep, and even preferred for children and the elderly.|$|R

25|$|His {{repertoire}} exploited {{his firm}} and powerful voice, {{and several of}} his songs became popular favourites. Although most renowned for his comic-patriotic ballad <b>The</b> <b>Roast</b> Beef of Old England, and above all for his setting of John Gay's lyric of Black Eyed Susan, others are lover's complaints or addresses, anacreontics, hunting songs (notably The sweet rosy morning peeps over the hills), fairy songs, dramatic pieces, and the like, to the number of more than 150. In addition to A New Book of Songs 1697 and A Second Book of Songs 1699, and A New Book of Songs 1711, further volumes were printed in 1727 and 1728. A number of the 1727 songs are settings of words by Abraham Cowley. Some songs written no doubt for his own performance contain roulades and word-painting, giving an impression of his vocal range and flexibility, and some have recitatives or short sections of part-writing, introducing dramatic structure into the context of concise set-pieces.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter what}} {{roasting}} method is used, the weather {{can affect the}} results, especially if roasting outdoors.

Humidity is a lesser concern; it changes <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> time and resulting quality.|$|R
50|$|When {{roasting}} any meat in an oven, trivet racks - {{which typically}} fit into roasting pans - {{are often used}} to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> pan and allow the juices of the joint to drip into <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> pan for <b>the</b> subsequent making of gravy.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of <b>the</b> coffee <b>roasting</b> process under operating conditions is proposed. This numerical tool {{is able to}} simulate the behaviour of all the components of a batch roaster as well as <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> process of <b>the</b> coffee beans within the drum. The model evaluates the heat and mass transfer between a hot air flow and the coffee beans during <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> process on <b>the</b> basis of the physical properties of the coffee and the operation of <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> machine. Different submodels {{are included in the}} modelling in order to address particular thermo-physical processes, such as the evaporation of coffee moisture and the heat released or absorbed by the beans due to <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> reactions. <b>The</b> proposed {{numerical model}} is thus able to predict the performance of the coffee roaster in terms of pressure, temperature and mass flow rate in the main sections of the system, as well as fuel consumption. In addition, the temperature profile of the coffee beans within <b>the</b> <b>roasting</b> drum is evaluated {{as a function of the}} system’s working conditions. Different roasting machine control strategies can therefore be compared and the effects on <b>the</b> coffee <b>roasting</b> profile can be analyzed. Experimental data in the literature on a laboratory roaster are used as a reference to validate the results provided by the numerical model. Finally, the tool’s predictive capabilities are addressed by simulating an industrial coffee roasting machine...|$|R

The panelists compared the two beverages on the bases of mouth feel, texture, taste, aroma, consistency, appearance and general acceptability. Correlation analysis of the results showed that although the texture, aroma, appearance and consistency were important for consumers, mouth feel and taste were more important for the overall acceptance of the beverages. The mouth feel of the non-roasted tiger nut beverage was more acceptable than that of <b>the</b> <b>roasted</b> tiger nut beverage.

Gottfried repeatedly warned the audience at <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> not to spread the rumor, which did not exist before the comedian's speech.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger {{called it a}} [...] "balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode", and called the fire opening scene [...] "not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all-time sitcom classic". Sepinwall said [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, [...] "This {{was one of my}} favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through." [...] Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called [...] "a very satisfying ending to <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> saga". He called the Black/Leachman romance [...] "creepy and hilarious", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode.|$|E
500|$|By 1967, KFC {{had become}} the sixth largest {{restaurant}} chain in the US by sales volume, and 30 percent of sales were take-out.

The company's growth pushed its stock value to [...] "stratospheric" [...] levels, according to Reuters, and in 1969 it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, KFC entered into ventures with other companies. Brown believed that the Colonel Sanders brand could be used to market anything, and launched the [...] "Kentucky Roast Beef" [...] restaurant chain, and [...] "Colonel Sanders Inns" [...] motels.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{most of whom}} seemed to have judged it on different criteria from their normal {{because it was a}} holiday episode. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon may have called it [...] "sickly oversweet", but maintained [...] "that's exactly what you want at Christmas". His colleague Patrick Burns wrote, [...] "Holiday episodes tread a dangerous line between sweet and saccharine, but this episode splits the difference perfectly." [...] The title of the article they wrote with Meghan Brown, [...] "Glee Does Christmas: Cheesy but Charming", found echoes in other reviews: both Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News also thought the episode was quite cheesy, but Benigno characterized it as [...] "the good kind of cheese; the kind you'll eat for antipasti before grandma and grandpa bring out <b>the</b> <b>roast</b> beef on Christmas dinner", and Reiter's bottom line was that it [...] "may not have been the most wonderful episode of the year, but it did feature moments that twinkled and shined like the lovingly trimmed family tree." [...] Time James Poniewozik was less enthusiastic when he noted that Glee delivered an episode [...] "that touched on all the requisite holiday bases but that felt perfunctory", and added that it was [...] "generally ho-ho-hum". Robert Canning of IGN gave it a [...] "great" [...] 8 out of 10, but stated that [...] "the episode as a whole was lacking just a bit to turn it into an absolute classic", and The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode a [...] "B−" [...] and wrote, [...] "I guess I'd say that I thought the episode worked moment-to-moment, without working as an overall narrative", but also stated that it was [...] "positively filled with stupid moments".|$|E
