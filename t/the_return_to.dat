We apply our methodology to labor market data from Argentina, using two points in time, a {{period during which}} <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling in Argentina increased.

However, 15 years of schooling also represents a significant threshold in 2002. <b>The</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling are higher in the private sector.

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> schooling {{acquired in the}} country of origin and the country of destination. It uses large-scale survey data on Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean immigrants in the Netherlands, which contain direct measures of pre- and post-migration schooling. It is studied whether <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> origin-country schooling depend on contextual factors: i. e., immigrant group and the region of living. Furthermore, we examine the importance of host-country schooling for labor market outcomes and if these can be partly explained by increasing contacts with natives. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> origin-country schooling are higher for Surinamese and Antillean immigrants (i. e., those originating from former Dutch colonies) than for immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. <b>The</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> origin-country schooling are not affected by ethnic concentration in the region of living. Finally, it appears that <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> host-country schooling are much larger than to origin-country schooling, and <b>the</b> higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> host-country schooling cannot be explained by increased social contacts with natives. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Estimating <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{scale is}} a classic problem of economics. In this paper we show how <b>to</b> {{efficiently}} estimate <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale without making unnecessary parametric or exogeneity assumptions. Specifically, the production function and its degree of homogeneity are both assumed to be unknown and we show how to estimate the latter — which can now be interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale — as efficiently as possible when {{some or all of}} the factor inputs are endogenous. This is a nonstandard problem because the production function is ill-posed in this setting. Hence, care has to be taken while deriving the efficiency bound and constructing an efficient estimator for <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale. 1...|$|R
