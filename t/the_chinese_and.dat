5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E

5|$|He {{became an}} agent to take {{acknowledgements}} to instruments on September12, 1884. On January 1, 1886, he {{was listed as}} one of the speakers at a political rally at Halawa. He later {{became a member of the}} Hui Kālaiʻāina (Hawaiian Political Association), a political group founded in 1888 to oppose the Bayonet Constitution and promote Native Hawaiian leadership in the government. After the adoption of the constitution, White gave a speech in Hilo speaking out against it. He criticized the exclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Japanese from the vote, especially focusing on the latter group because of Hawaii's treaty with the Empire of Japan. By 1890, he had returned to his native island of Maui.|$|E
5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} towards his subjects {{and believed that}} it was his duty to treat <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E

The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty; the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> behead Dutch people in executions while the frontier aboriginals {{in the mountains and}} plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.|$|E

5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was getting rid of <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> <b>and</b> for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{advanced}} towards the town of Taechon with its 11th and 12th Infantry Regiment on point. Although Chinese booby traps and mortar fire tried to delay the Koreans along the way, the 1st Infantry Division still managed to envelop the town by the dusk of November 24. But unknown to the Koreans, the 1st Infantry Division was marching into a Chinese assembly area, and the resistance around Taechon immediately increased as the result. On the night of November 24, the defending PVA 66th Corps counterattacked the Koreans with infantry and cavalry charges, and <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Korean troops were soon locked in a seesaw battle from November 25 to 26.|$|E
5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E

Together, the railways create an uninterrupted rail link between the port city of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province and Kazakhstan. In 1995 <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Kazakhstan governments signed an agreement which allows the latter to use Lianyungang as its primary seaport for exports and imports, and the former intends for Lianyungang to serve as the designated starting point for the New Eurasian Land Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The SUPP {{attacked}} the DAP {{on the basis}} of its coalition with the Islamist PAS, arguing that “A vote for Rocket is a vote for Islamic State". Lim Kit Siang, the parliamentary leader of the DAP, said that the issue was a “killer weapon” which could “finish off” the chances of DAP's candidate winning by frightening off <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> non-Muslim voters in Sibu as it did during the 1999 Malaysian General Election where both Karpal Singh and Lim himself lost their parliamentary seats. The SUPP also claimed that if the DAP was to be voted in kampua noodles could no longer be sold as they were mixed with pork lard; a reference to PAS's policy to establish Malaysia as an Islamic state.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos {{illustrated}} {{descriptions of}} warships {{had a significant}} influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the Wubei Zhi from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the Wujing Zongyao. The use of pictures from the Wujing Zongyao would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's Ka-i Tsūshō-kō (Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians) in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's Wakan Senyōshū (Collected Studies on the Ships used by <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> Japanese) in 1766.|$|E

5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available.

Its internal components are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E
5|$|Under Ridgway's command, the Eighth Army pressed north {{again in}} January.

With the improved military situation, Truman now saw the opportunity to offer a negotiated peace but, on 24 March, MacArthur called upon China {{to admit that it}} had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> his own superiors.

5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create {{both large and small}} seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among <b>the</b> <b>Chinese,</b> <b>and</b> were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
