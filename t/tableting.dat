40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to produce a quick/slow biphasic delivery system for ibuprofen. A dual-component tablet made of a sustained release <b>tableted</b> core and an immediate release <b>tableted</b> coat was prepared by direct compression. Both the core and the coat contained a model drug (ibuprofen). The sustained release effect was achieved with a polymer (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC] or ethylcellulose) to modulate the release of the drug. The in vitro drug release profile from these tablets showed the desired biphasic release behavior: the ibuprofen contained in the fast releasing component was dissolved within 2 minutes, whereas the drug in the core tablet was released at different times (⊂ 16 or > 24 hours), depending on the composition of the matrix tablet. Based on the release kinetic parameters calculated, it can be concluded that the HPMC core was suitable for providing a constant and controlled release (zero order) {{for a long period of}} time...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{application}} of small quantities of nitrogen (N) fertiliser has improved cereal yields on low-input farms in semi-arid Zimbabwe, the practice {{is reported to be}} laborious and time-consuming by farmers. In an effort to make micro-dosing less labour-intensive and more precise, an ammonium nitrate (AN) tablet, the equivalent of a micro-dose of prill AN (28 kg N ha− 1) applied per maize plant, was developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in collaboration with Agri-Seeds, Zimbabwe. This study characterized the physical stability, chemical (N% and solubility) and agronomic performance of AN tablets compared with prill AN. Only 10 % of tablets broke when dropped from 2 m, showing that they are physically stable and can handle rough treatment. The N content in the tablets (33. 3 %) was comparable to that in prill AN (34. 6 %). However, the tablet formulation took twice as long to dissolve than prill AN when placed on a wet soil. Despite this difference in solubility, simple leaching column experiments suggest that less than 2 % of the total AN applied was lost due to leaching. Agronomic trials were superimposed on the paired-plot demonstrations used to promote micro-dosing and the conservation agriculture tillage technique of planting basins from 2005 to 2008. Each tillage (plough and basins) plot was subdivided into three sub-plots on which no AN, prill AN and <b>tableted</b> AN treatments were superimposed. Maize was planted and management of plots was left to farmers. Micro-dosing with either prill or <b>tableted</b> AN significantly (p < 0. 001) increased maize grain yield by over 40 % in all seasons for planting basins. However, on the ploughed plot there was no yield benefit to using either AN formulation in the season with the lowest rainfall (2006 – 2007). There {{was no significant difference in}} grain yield and agronomic N use efficiency between prill and <b>tableted</b> AN formulations except for the 2005 – 2006 season in planting basins. During this season, in planting basins, <b>tableted</b> AN had significantly (p < 0. 001) higher rainwater productivity than prill AN, which translated into greater grain yield. In addition, the maximum benefit to micro-dosing was observed to accrue when combined with water harvesting techniques such as planting basins. An observation supported by the host farmers, who in the second and third seasons chose to apply available basal soil fertility amendments to the basin plots over the flat plots. Thus, AN tablets if available at an affordable price can be used by smallholder farmers to more precisely apply N fertiliser. Future work should focus on the labour issues of micro-dosing, and making cost-effective tablets available to resource-poor farmers and also addressing other limiting soil nutrient...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objectives: The {{apparent}} widespread {{extent of}} zinc (Zn) deficiency {{in developing countries}} and the efficacy of oral Zn supplements {{as an adjunct to}} oral rehydration therapy make oral Zn supplementation an increasingly important modality in clinical medicine and public health. In this study we aimed to compare the relative bioavailability of oral doses of 30 mg of Zn in two dosing forms Subjects/Methods: In total, 10 healthy male volunteers ingested oral Zn doses with 200 ml plain water at about 0830 hours in the fasting state on two occasions, once as 30 mg of Zn in an aqueous solution of reagent grade zinc sulfate (ZnSO 4) and another time as 1. 5 NutriSet Zn tablets (Nutriset, Malaunay, France); on a third occasion, only plain water was consumed. Venous blood specimens were collected at baseline, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after ingestion and the plasma Zn was measured for each sample. Results: The relative bioavailability of oral Zn from a commonly used, <b>tableted</b> (NutriSet) form is only about half of that of a reference dose of aqueous ZnSO 4 as indicated by the area under the curve of serial plasma Zn excursion and maximal change in circulating Zn. Conclusions: Reduced or absent functional outcomes in Zn intervention trials may derive, in part, from a lower than anticipated intestinal uptake of the Zn in the <b>tableted</b> form...|$|R
