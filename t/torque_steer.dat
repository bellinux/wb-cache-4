5|$|While {{the initial}} <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> and <b>steer</b> angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|R

In this work, we study stripe fixation through a series of closed-loop perturbation experiments; flies are observed stabilizing moving stripes oscillating over a range of frequencies. A system identification analysis of input–output data furnishes a fre-quency response function (FRF), a nonparametric description of the behavior. We parameterize this FRF description to hypothesize a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control model for the fixation behavior.

A following swivel selector valve is firstly {{designed to meet the}} demand for the hydraulic pressure commutating as soon as the dual actuator nose wheel steering mechanism passes through its dead center position. Considering the multiple objective functions of nose wheel steering mechanisms, those core design parameters are multiobjective optimized.

40|$|Already {{for some}} time, {{electronic}} enhancements regarding vehicle behavior {{has made its}} way into the aviation and automotive industry by the term "by-wire" technology. Electronic sensors and actuators are used to replace traditional mechanical systems in which software is used to operate the actuators {{in a way that is}} not possible with traditional mechanical systems. The use of steer-by-wire technology can also offer great opportunities on single-track vehicles like motorcycles, scooters and bicycles. Single-track vehicles can be highly unstable, especially at low forward speeds and they require a relative high amount of rider control. By replacing the mechanical connection between the handlebar- and steering-assembly with electronic actuators, a controller can be used to control the dynamic behavior of the bicycle based on additional sensor information. This research has focused on the modeling and simulation of a steer-by-wire control strategy to modify and enhance the lateral stability of a bicycle at low forward speeds. Case studies show additional capabilities of a steer-by-wire system on bicycles to influence its dynamic behavior, by providing a dynamic response comparable to a bicycle with a virtually different geometry or even the ability to stabilize an inherently unstable bicycle. A steer-by-wire bicycle prototype was designed and build by replacement of the mechanical connection between handlebarand steering-assembly by electronic actuators and a custom digital controller. The steer-bywire bicycle prototype equipped with sensors, measuring the forward speed- and roll-rate is subsequently used to experimentally evaluate the proposed control algorithms. Test results obtained from experiments conducted by the steer-by-wire bicycle prototype equipped with a stabilizing controller algorithm, show the ability to stabilize the lateral motion of the bicycle-rider combination at low forward speeds as predicted by numerical simulations. Rider steer effort is reduced which makes the bicycle more easy to ride and could lead to future implementation on bicycles tailored for elderly or those physically impaired. The importance of <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> feedback is indicated by comparison of steer effort measurement results between experiments with and without <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> feedback at the handlebar.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Brake <b>Steer</b> <b>Torque</b> (BST) induced {{stand-up}} tendency of Powered Two Wheelers (PTW) and measures to lower the associated risk for running wide on curve accidents with sudden, unforeseen braking. Focus is set on the BST Avoidance Mechanism (BSTAM), a chassis design that eliminates the BST through lateral inclination of the kinematic steering axis. A simple mathematical model is used to identify its main influences on the driving behavior and derive an optimized system layout. Its theoretical potential is evaluated against the standard chassis using different cornering adaptive brake force distributions and riding styles. For the first time ever, a motorcycle with state-of-the-art brake system (Honda CBR 600 RR, C-ABS) {{is equipped with a}} BSTAM and tested in corner braking experiments.

5000|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>steer</b> is the {{tendency}} for some front-wheel-drive cars to pull {{to the left or}} right under hard acceleration. It {{is a result of the}} offset between the point about which the wheel steers (it is aligned with the points where the wheel is connected to the steering mechanisms) and the centroid of its contact patch. The tractive force acts through the centroid of the contact patch, and the offset of the steering point means that a turning moment about the axis of steering is generated. In an ideal situation, the left and right wheels would generate equal and opposite moments, canceling each other out; however, in reality, this is less likely to happen. <b>Torque</b> <b>steer</b> can be addressed by using a longitudinal layout, equal length drive shafts, half shafts, a multilink suspension or centre-point steering geometry.|$|E

40|$|Rider {{control in}} bicycling is modeled by first adding the rider as a passive {{mechanism}} to the Whipple bicycle model.

The experimental data is obtained from riding a bi-cycle on a narrow treadmill while applying an intermitted lateral perturbation {{by means of an}} impulse force applied at the seat post. The experiments are conducted in both the stable and the unstable forward speed range. After some filtering, a parametric control model is fitted to the data. Finally, the gains of this con-trol model are used to identify the specific optimal control LQR cost function which the rider is using to control the bicycle on the treadmill at the various forward speeds. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} designing a control system for a modern bicycle so that the bicycle is stable and follows a path. We propose a multi-loop control architecture, where each loop is systematically designed using linear control techniques. The proposed strategy guarantees that the bicycle asymptotically converges to paths of constant curvature. A key advantage of our approach is that by using linear techniques analysis and controller design are relatively simple. We base our control design on the nonlinear (corrected) Whipple model, which has been previously verified for correctness and experimentally validated. The equations of motion for the nonlinear model are very complicated, and would take many pages to explicitly state. They also have no known closed form solution. To enable analysis of the model we linearize it about a trajectory such that the bicycle is upright and travelling straight ahead. This linearization allows us {{to arrive at a}} parameterized linear time-invariant state-space representation of the bicycle dynamics, suitable for analysis and control design. The inner-loop control consists of a forward-speed controller as well as a lean and steer controller. To keep the bicycle at a constant forward speed, we develop a high-bandwidth proportional controller that uses a torque along the axis of the rear wheel of the bicycle to keep the angular velocity of the rear wheel at a constant setpoint. To stabilize the bicycle at this forward speed, lean <b>torque</b> and <b>steer</b> <b>torque</b> are treated as the control signals. We design a state-feedback controller and augment integrators to the output feedback of the lean angle and steer angle to provide perfect steady-state tracking. To arrive at the gains for state feedback, linear-quadratic regulator methods are used. When following a constant-curvature path, a vehicle has a constant yaw rate. Using this knowledge, we begin designing the outer-loop path-following control by finding a map that converts a yaw rate into appropriate lean angle and steer angle references for the inner loop. After the map is completed, system identification is performed by applying a yaw-rate reference to the map and analyzing the response of the bicycle. Using the linear approximation obtained, a classical feedback controller for yaw-rate tracking is designed. In addition to yaw-rate control, to track a path the yaw angle of the bicycle must match that of the path and the bicycle must physically be on the path. To analyze these conditions a linear approximation for the distance between the bicycle to the path is found, enabling construction of a linear approximation of the entire system. We then find that by passing the signal for the difference in yaw rate and the distance through separate controllers, summing their output, and subtracting from the reference yaw rate of the path, the bicycle converges to the path. After developing the general design procedure, the final part of the thesis shows a step by step design example and demonstrates the results of applying the proposed control architecture to the nonlinear bicycle model. We highlight some problems that can arise when the bicycle is started far from the path. To overcome these problems we develop the concept of a virtual path, which is a path that when followed returns the bicycle to the actual path. We also recognize that, in practice, typical paths do not have constant curvature, so we construct more practical paths by joining straight line segments and circular arc segments, representing a practical path similar to a path that would be encountered when biking through a series of rural roads. Finally, we finish the design example by demonstrating the performance of the control architecture on such a path. From these simulations we show that using the suggested controller design that the bicycle will converge to a constant curvature path. Additionally with using the controllers we develop that in the absence of disturbance the bicycle will stay within the intended traffic lane when travelling on a typical rural road...|$|R
40|$|Suspension is a {{necessary}} system for solar cars because it protects the frame and other on-board components from large jolts encountered along highways. If the suspension is too soft, energy is wasted by absorbing the motion of a car as it travels over bumps. For increased efficiency, most solar cars use a suspension that is stiffer than normal. For this project, the solar car has two front wheels and one rear wheel. The front wheels provide turning, so the front suspension needs to let the wheels turn. The suspension also allows the wheels to {{move up and down}} as the car runs over bumps. The type of front suspension for this project is a double wishbone system. It has a pair of an A-frames, one above the other, mounted to {{the top and bottom of}} the wheel hub. A separate spring until then sits between either the hub itself or one of the wishbones and the body to control the wheel movement. Lastly, this car uses a trailing arm on rear suspension. This kind of suspension has only one link (arm) on each side which puts greater structural requirements on it.
