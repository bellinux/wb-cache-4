5|$|Falklands '82 (released as Malvinas '82 in Spanish markets) is a 1986 turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. It is the fifth instalment of the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the 1982 Falklands War and revolves around the Argentine occupation and subsequent British re-capture of the Falkland Islands. The player controls the British Task Force as <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> defeat all Argentine forces on the archipelago or re-capture every settlement.|$|E

25|$|The {{steepness}} of the Brynsbakken {{is a major}} inconvenience for freight operators. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> use {{an extra}} locomotive, which adds time and cost, or operate shorter trains, which reduces the operating efficiency. Brynsbakken has therefore {{been identified as a}} bottleneck in transport from the Sørlandet Line, Sweden and the Continent to Alnabru. Increased capacity southwards will allow for more freight trains towards Gothenburg, Denmark and the continent.|$|E
5000|$|Reading comprehension: {{a passage}} is {{presented}} to the reader, which <b>they</b> <b>must</b> read <b>either</b> silently or out loud. Then {{a series of questions}} are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage.|$|R
50|$|The two {{cells in}} the top left must be 1+2. The 3 cells to the right totaling 15 cannot {{therefore}} have either a 1 or a 2, so <b>they</b> <b>must</b> be <b>either</b> 3+4+8, 3+5+7, or 4+5+6.|$|R
50|$|Government {{bodies are}} {{required}} to respond in 15 working days. <b>They</b> <b>must</b> provide <b>either</b> a certified copy of the document or {{when it is not}} possible to make a copy, applicants can examine them at the institution.|$|R
25|$|Zugzwang {{most often}} {{occurs in the}} endgame {{when the number of}} pieces, and so the number of {{possible}} moves, is reduced, and the exact move chosen is often critical. The first diagram shows the simplest possible example of zugzwang. If it is White's move, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> stalemate Black with 1.Kc6 or abandon the pawn, allowing 1...Kxc7 with a draw. If it is Black's move, the only legal move is 1...Kb7, which allows White to win with 2.Kd7 followed by queening the pawn on the next move.|$|E
25|$|Teams must {{complete}} each {{challenge as}} {{specified by the}} clues given to them throughout the Race. Should a team fail to properly complete a challenge, violate any provisions made in a clue or task description, or miss a clue altogether (unless specifically allowed to do so, e.g., by winning the Fast Forward, or by using an Express Pass), <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> {{go back to the}} location of the challenge and complete the challenge, or incur a penalty when they check in (see Penalties and time credits below).|$|E
25|$|Computer {{hardware}} {{is usually}} sold with an operating system other than Linux already installed {{by the original}} equipment manufacturer (OEM). In the case of IBM PC compatibles the OS is usually Microsoft Windows; {{in the case of}} Apple Macintosh computers it has always been a version of Apple's OS, currently macOS; Sun Microsystems sold SPARC hardware with the Solaris installed; video game consoles such as the Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii each have their own proprietary OS. This limits Linux's market share: consumers are unaware that an alternative exists, they must make a conscious effort to use a different operating system, and <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> perform the actual installation themselves, or depend on support from a friend, relative, or computer professional.|$|E

500|$|Most recently, in August 2013, a US Court of Appeals {{decision}} {{told the}} NRC and the Obama administration that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> [...] "approve or reject the Energy Department's application for [...] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain." [...] They cannot simply make plans for its closure {{in violation of}} US law.|$|E
500|$|.....I again {{reiterated the}} demand for the flag, adding [...] "that it was {{impossible}} for the nation to have two fathers; that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> be the children of the Spaniards, or acknowledge their American father". After a silence of some time an old man rose, went to the door, took down the Spanish flag, brought it and laid it at my feet; he then received the American flag, and elevated it on the staff which had lately borne the standard of his Catholic Majesty.|$|E
500|$|Under Section 8 of the Act, {{trustees}} {{can purchase}} land [...] "as an investment, for occupation by the beneficiaries or {{for any other}} reason". Once this land has been purchased {{they are free to}} do with it what they could if they were the absolute owner; they can sell it, lease it or mortgage it. This is a default provision, and can be made irrelevant if the trust instrument contains other rules and requirements. This land may only be bought in Britain; if trustees wish to purchase land outside Britain, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> invest in companies which own land or alter the trust instrument to allow it.|$|E
50|$|The {{court has}} five judges, who are {{nominated}} by the President of the United States and {{confirmed by the}} United States Senate. Judges serve fifteen-year terms. After their term, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> be <b>either</b> re-appointed or retire from the court. When hearing a case, all five judges sit as a panel.|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally {{each player}} takes a turn in order, drawing a single card {{from the top}} of the deck. Before looking at the card, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> call <b>either</b> [...] "Black" [...] or [...] "Red" [...] {{indicating}} their guess as to the color of the card. If they guess correctly their turn is completed and the next player draws. If they guess incorrectly <b>they</b> <b>must</b> drink a specified type and volume of alcohol before their turn is over.|$|R
500|$|The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame honors {{players who}} have shown {{exceptional}} skill at basketball, all-time great coaches, referees, and other major contributors to the sport. Located in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Basketball Hall of Fame is named after Dr. James Naismith, who invented the sport in 1891; he {{was inducted into the}} Hall as a contributor in 1959. The Coach category has existed {{since the beginning of the}} Hall of Fame. For a person to be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> be [...] "fully retired for five years" [...] or, if they are still active, [...] "have coached as either a fulltime assistant or head coach on the high school and/or college and/or professional level" [...] for 25years.|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{research}} indicates that the [...] "common disease-rare variant" [...] {{may be a better}} explanation for many common diseases. In this model, rare but higher-risk gene variants cause common diseases. This model may be relevant for diseases that reduces fertility. In contrast, for common genes associated with common disease to persist <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> have little effect during the reproductive period of life (like Alzheimer's disease) or provide some advantage in the original environment (like genes causing autoimmune diseases also providing resistance against infections). In either case varying frequencies of genes variants in different populations may be an explanation for health disparities. Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, deep venous thrombosis, Crohn disease, and type 2 diabetes appear to adhere to [...] "common disease-common variant" [...] model.|$|E
2500|$|By this stage, Stephen had {{returned}} to the Lateran, and he was confronted in the Basilica of St. Theodore by the fleeing Afiarta and his co-conspirators being chased by Christophorus and his supporters. Apparently at this point, a suspicious Christophorus, believing that Stephen had entered into some agreement with Desiderius, forced Stephen into taking an oath that he would not turn Christophorus or his son over to the Lombards. After this, a furious Stephen berated Christophorus, demanded he stop harassing Afiarta, and ordered him and his followers to withdraw, to which Christophorus complied. The next day, Stephen fled to St. Peter’s Basilica to seek the protection of Desiderius. The Lombard king, shutting Stephen up in his suites in the Basilica, made it clear to the Pope that the price for his help was to be the handing over of Christophorus and Sergius. The Pope sent two bishops to negotiate with Christophorus and Sergius, telling them that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> retire to a monastery or come out to him at St. Peter’s. At the same time, a message was sent from Desiderius {{to the people of the}} city, declaring that: ”Pope Stephen bids you not to fight against your brethren, but to expel Christophorus from the city, and save it, yourselves, and your children.” ...|$|E

60|$|This {{character}} is perhaps commoner than philosophers suppose. And for persons of that stamp to learn much by conversation, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> speak with their superiors, not in intellect, {{for that is}} a superiority that must be proved, but in station. If they cannot find a friend to bully them for their good, <b>they</b> <b>must</b> find <b>either</b> an old man, a woman, or some one so far below them in the artificial order of society, that courtesy may be particularly exercised.|$|R
2500|$|The Lord Chief Baron {{observed}} that Smith had neither acted in self-defence nor had shot Millwood by accident; {{he had not}} been provoked by the supposed apparition or had attempted to apprehend it. Millwood had not committed any offence to justify being shot, and even if the supposed ghost had been shot, {{it would not have been}} acceptable, as frightening people while pretending to be a ghost was not a serious felony, but a far less serious misdemeanour, only meriting a small fine. The judge closed his remarks by reminding the jury that the accused’s good character meant nothing in this case. Therefore, Macdonald directed the jury to find the accused guilty of murder if they believed the facts presented by the witnesses. [...] After considering for an hour, the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter. Macdonald informed the jury that [...] "the Court could not receive such a verdict", and that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> find Smith guilty of murder, or acquit him: that Smith believed Millwood to be a ghost was irrelevant. [...] The jury then returned with a verdict of guilty. After passing the customary sentence of death, Macdonald stated his intent to report the case to the king, who had the power to commute the sentence.|$|E

50|$|The Briefcase is an Australian reality {{television}} series, {{based on}} the American series of the same name, which airs on the Nine Network. Each episode sees two Australian families, struggling financially, each given $100,000 in cash that <b>they</b> <b>must</b> decide <b>either</b> to keep for themselves or to give all or in part to help out the other family, unaware that their counterparts are also faced with the same dilemma.|$|R
50|$|One {{drawback}} with {{spray drying}} {{is that the}} particles it produces are too fine to be used effectively by the consumer; <b>they</b> <b>must</b> first be <b>either</b> steam-fused in towers similar to spray dryers or by belt agglomeration to produce particles of suitable size.|$|R
