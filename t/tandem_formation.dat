40|$|Retroelement cDNA can {{integrate}} {{into the}} genome using the element-encoded integrase, {{or it can}} recombine with preexisting elements using the recombination system of the host. Recombination is a particularly important pathway for the yeast retrotransposon Ty 5 and accounts for ~ 30 % of the putative transposition events when a homologous substrate is carried on a plasmid and ~ 7 % when the substrate {{is located at the}} chromosomal URA 3 locus. Characterization of recombinants revealed that they are either simple replacements of the marker gene or tandem elements. Using an assay system in which the donor element and recombination substrates are separated, we found that the long terminal repeats (LTRs) are critical for <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation.</b> LTR-containing substrates generate tandem elements at frequencies more than 10 -fold higher than similarly sized internal Ty 5 sequences. Internal sequences, however, facilitate <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> when associated with an LTR, and there is a linear relationship between frequencies of <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> and the length of LTR-containing substrates. We propose that recombination is initiated between the LTRs of the cDNA and substrate and that internal sequences promote <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> by facilitating sequence alignment. Because of its location in subtelomeric regions, recombinational amplification of Ty 5 may contribute to the organization of chromosome ends...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> regime, planets form at two {{distinct}} sites where solid particles are densely accumulated {{due to the}} on/off state of the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We found that <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> can reproduce the solid component distribution of the Solar System and tends to produce {{a smaller number of}} large planets through continuous pebble flow into the planet formation sites. In the present paper, we investigate the dependence of <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> on the vertical magnetic field of the protoplanetary disk. We calculated two cases of Bz= 3. 4 × 10 − 3 G and Bz= 3. 4 × 10 − 5 G at 100 AU as well as the canonical case of Bz= 3. 4 × 10 − 4 G. We found that <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> holds up well {{in the case of the}} strong magnetic field (Bz= 3. 4 × 10 − 3 G). On the other hand, in the case of a weak magnetic field (Bz= 3. 4 × 10 − 5 G) at 100 AU, a new regime of planetary growth is realized: the planets grow independently at different places in the dispersed area of the MRI-suppressed region of r= 8 − 30 AU at a lower accretion rate of M˙< 10 − 7. 4 [*]M⊙yr− 1. We call this the “dispersed planet formation” regime. This may lead to a system with a larger number of smaller planets that gain high eccentricity through mutual collisions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerodynamics is a {{critical}} factor in the performance of cyclists, with drag being the dominant resistive force at racing speeds. Many cycling events involve athletes riding in close proximity. Previous studies have shown that flow interactions result in significant drag reductions for tandem cyclists, inline parallel to the flow [1 – 5]. However, the flow mechanisms associated with these changes have not been well characterised to date. This paper reports the results of wake surveys of an athlete in single and <b>tandem</b> <b>formations</b> in the Monash Wind Tunnel. Flow measurements were phase averaged over segments of the crank cycle to investigate the dynamic evolution of the wake of a pedalling cyclist. Results show that the dominant hip vortices previously identified {{in the wake of a}} single cyclist remain dominant in the trailing cyclist wake, with minimal reduction in vorticity. Wake profiles indicate the large drag saving experienced by a trailing cyclist are not due to disruption of the wake vortices or significant streamwise momentum recovery...|$|R

50|$|On 7 September 1893, one of J & E Woods 1892 {{engines in}} Mutual Mills, Rochdale was {{extensively}} tested by Mr J L F Crosland {{and the results}} published. The engines were triple expansion with four cylinders arranged in a horizontal double <b>tandem</b> <b>formation.</b> The high pressure (HP) cylinder had a bore of 21 in, the intermediate pressure (IP) cylinder had a bore of 33 in and the two low pressure (LP) cylinders 35 in. The stroke was 6 ft and the engine operated at 53 rpm. The engines were fitted with Corliss valves operated by a simple proprietary trip motion. The piston rods for the HP and IP are 4.75 in and 5.25 in. During the test, the two 30 ft by 8 ft Lancashire boilers with 3 ft 2 in diameter flues produced steam at 156 psi. There were Galloway tubes in the flues and behind the boilers was an economiser with 288 pipes. Water was delivered to the boilers at 304 F. The boilers were fed by mechanical stokers using coal known as Shaw slack with a calorific value of 12,963 Btu/lb. During two days of testing the engine developed power of 1089.7 and 1049.4. The power developed on {{the two sides of}} the engine was balanced being 542.2 IHP and 547.5 IHP. On the two days 1.37 lb/IHP hr and 1.38 lb/IHP hr. Taking into account that coal could be bought at 6s/ton- this means that 1d would buy 23.1 IHP hrs or 5544 IHP hrs per pound sterling. For a thermal efficiency point of view, of the 14935 Btu of heat supplied, 2595 Btus were converted into mechanical work. This is an efficiency of 0.172 while a perfect engine gives 0.279, so the engine has a relative efficiency of 0.616. This is taken as the reference standard for an engine of this configuration.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceGeologyMatthew W. TottenThe thermal {{maturity}} of hydrocarbon-rich source rocks {{can be estimated}} by several different methods. These methods focus on a specific geochemical or mineralogical aspect contained within the rock. Because each method has limitations, it is advisable to use several methods to better determine thermal maturation. This report summarizes two common methods used to determine thermal maturity, vitrinite reflectance and illitization. Vitrinite reflectance and illitization have both {{been shown to be}} effected by similar temperatures that are within the hydrocarbon generation window. In some previous studies these two methods give different levels of maturation when looked at in <b>tandem.</b> <b>Formations</b> such as the Woodford Shale of Oklahoma are made up almost completely of illite in the clay fraction, even at low levels of vitrinite reflectance. These are also without a clear source of potassium, which is often the limiting factor in the process of illitization. Totten et al. (2013) suggest that in place of potassium feldspars, which are a common source of K⁺ for illite (but lacking in the Woodford) that the needed K⁺ was provided by the organic material that was being altered under the same temperatures of the clay minerals. The Woodford contains large amounts of organic matter, This would be consistent with promoting illitization at lower thermal maturities than organic-poor shales...|$|R
40|$|The {{replication}} of retroelements may have deleterious {{effects on the}} hosts. Therefore, elements and their hosts have coevolved mechanisms to regulate retroelement replication. This regulation can occur at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels {{as well as through}} targeted integration or cDNA recombination. I have studied host regulation of the Saccharomyces retrotransposon Ty 5. I have found that Ty 5 transcription is carefully controlled. Transcription of Ty 5 is haploid specific and is repressed 10 fold in diploid strains. Ty 5 transcription is also regulated by the pheromone response pathway, which is activated during mating. In addition, Ty 5 transcription is regulated by flanking sequences. Ty 5 preferentially integrates into regions of silent chromatin at the telomeres and the HM loci, which, in turn, represses Ty 5 transcription. Although the repressive effects of silent chromatin have been well characterized, I have found that transcription and transposition of Ty 5 elements embedded in silent chromatin can be induced by pheromone treatment or during the mating process. Another level of retroelement regulation is the targeting of element cDNA to non-coding regions. cDNA can be targeted by the element-encoded integrase protein or through recombination with pre-existing elements. I found that Ty 5 recombines at high frequency with homologous substrates. Two classes of recombinants were identified: tandem elements and elements that arose by marker exchange between the Ty 5 cDNA and the substrate. Ty 5 cDNA recombination is dependent on the host repair protein Rad 52, but not on the host repair protein Rad 1 or Ty 5 integrase. Using an assay system that allowed me to identify the cis-acting sequences important Ty 5 cDNA recombination, I have found that the Ty 5 LTR is critical for <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation.</b> Internal Ty 5 sequences can facilitate <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> in the presence of an LTR. These data have made it possible for me to propose models for <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> based on recombination between the LTRs of the cDNA and substrate. The LTR was not found to be important for marker exchange events, suggesting that the two classes of recombinants arise by different mechanisms. Targeted integration and recombinational amplification of Ty 5 elements at the telomeres suggests that Ty 5 may {{play an important role in}} telomere structure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new united theory of planet formation, which {{includes}} magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and porous aggregation of solid particles in a consistent way. We {{show that the}} “tandem planet formation” regime is {{likely to result in}} solar system-like planetary systems. In the <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> regime, planetesimals form at two distinct sites: the outer and inner edges of the MRI suppressed region. The former {{is likely to be the}} source of the outer gas giants, and the latter is the source for the inner volatile-free rocky planets. Our study spans disks with a various range of accretion rates, and we find that <b>tandem</b> planet <b>formation</b> can occur for M˙= 10 − 7. 3 - 10 − 6. 9 M⊙yr− 1. The rocky planets form between 0. 4 – 2  AU, while the icy planets form between 6 – 30  AU; no planets form in 2 – 6  AU region for any accretion rate. This is consistent with the gap in the solid component distribution in the solar system, which has only a relatively small Mars and a very small amount of material in the main asteroid belt from 2 – 6  AU. The tandem regime is consistent with the idea that the Earth was initially formed as a completely volatile-free planet. Water and other volatile elements came later through the accretion of icy material by occasional inward scattering from the outer regions.

40|$|The yeast {{retrotransposon}} Ty 5 preferentially {{integrates into}} regions of silent chromatin. Ty 5 cDNA also recombines with homologous sequences, generating tandem elements or elements that have exchanged markers between cDNA and substrate. In this study, we demonstrate that Ty 5 integration {{depends upon the}} conserved DD(35) E domain of integrase and cis-acting sequences {{at the end of}} the long terminal repeat (LTR) implicated in integrase binding. cDNA recombination requires Rad 52 p, which is responsible for homologous recombination. Interestingly, Ty 5 cDNA recombines at least three times more frequently with substrates in silent chromatin than with a control substrate at an internal chromosomal locus. This preference depends upon the Ty 5 targeting domain that is responsible for integration specificity, suggesting that localization of cDNA to silent chromatin results in the enhanced recombination. Recombination with a telomeric substrate occasionally generates highly reiterated Ty 5 arrays, and mechanisms for <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> were explored by using a plasmid-based recombination assay. Point mutations were introduced into plasmid targets, and recombination products were characterized to determine recombination initiation sites. Despite our previous observation of the importance of the LTR in forming tandem elements, recombination cannot simply be explained by crossover events between the LTRs of substrate and cDNA. We propose an alternative model based on single-strand annealing, where single-stranded cDNA initiates <b>tandem</b> element <b>formation</b> and the LTR is required for strand displacement to form a looped intermediate. Retrotransposons are increasingly found associated with chromosome ends, and amplification of Ty 5 by both integration and recombination exemplifies how retroelements can contribute to telomere dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{report the}} results of a pilot {{training}} program incorporating high-fidelity simulation developed for snowplow operators. Ratings of user acceptance of the training were very high, with drivers of all levels of experience indicating that the training helped them prepare for several issues critical to the safe and efficient operation of a snowplow. In the 6 -month period following training, the odds of getting in an accident were lower for the group of drivers who received training compared with a matched control group who did not receive it. In addition, the data indicate that fuel efficiency was greater for the trained drivers than for the control group. The safe operation of a snowplow requires a high level of expertise. Drivers often operate in very stressful situations, maneuvering 30 tons of equipment in tight quarters in blizzard conditions. Drivers often work long shifts, and negotiate their vehicle in heavy traffic, on slippery roads with very limited visibility.

40|$|A central {{question}} in genomic imprinting {{is how a}} specific sequence is recognized as the target for epigenetic marking. In both mammals and plants, imprinted genes are often associated with tandem repeats and transposon-related sequences, but the role of these elements in epigenetic gene silencing remains elusive. FWA is an imprinted gene in Arabidopsis thaliana expressed specifically in the female gametophyte and endosperm. Tissue-specific and imprinted expression of FWA depends on DNA methylation in the FWA promoter, which is comprised of two direct repeats containing a sequence related to a SINE retroelement. Methylation of this element causes epigenetic silencing, {{but it is not}} known whether the methylation is targeted to the SINE-related sequence itself or the direct repeat structure is also necessary. Here we show that the repeat structure in the FWA promoter is highly diverse in species within the genus Arabidopsis. Four independent <b>tandem</b> repeat <b>formation</b> events were found in three closely related species. Another related species, A. halleri, did not have a tandem repeat in the FWA promoter. Unexpectedly, even in this species, FWA expression was imprinted and the FWA promoter was methylated. In addition, our expression analysis of FWA gene in vegetative tissues revealed high frequency of intra-specific variation in the expression level. In conclusion, we show that the tandem repeat structure is dispensable for the epigenetic silencing of the FWA gene. Rather, SINE-related sequence is sufficient for imprinting, vegetative silencing, and targeting of DNA methylation. Frequent independent <b>tandem</b> repeat <b>formation</b> events in the FWA promoter led us to propose that they may be a consequence, rather than cause, of the epigenetic control. The possible significance of epigenetic variation in reproductive strategies during evolution is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} of the drag (CD) and lift coefficients (CL) of two fixed solid spherical particles placed at different positions relative each other is studied. Simulations are carried out for particle Reynolds numbers of 50, 100 and 200 and the particle position {{is defined by the}} angle between the line connecting the centers of the particles and the free-stream direction (a) and the separation distance (do) between the particles. The flow around the particles is simulated using two different methods; the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), using two different computational codes, and a conventional finite difference approach, where the Volume of Solid Method (VOS) is used to represent the particles. Comparisons with available numerical and experimental data show that both methods can be used to accurately resolve the flow field around particles and calculate the forces the particles are subjected to. Independent of the Reynolds number, the largest change in drag, as compared to the single particle case, occurs for particles placed in <b>tandem</b> <b>formation.</b> Compared to a single particle, the drag reduction for the secondary particle in tandem arrangement is as high as 60 %, 70 % and 80 % for Re = 50, 100 and 200, respectively. The development of the recirculation zone is found to have a significant influence on the drag force. Depending on the flow Situation in-between the particles for various particle arrangements, attraction and repulsion forces are detected due to low and high pressure regions, respectively. The results show that the inter-particle forces are not negligible even under very dilute conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} maps {{the interplay}} of conservative forces and their feminist foes in Indiana from 1950 through 1980 and argues that issues like the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and International Women’s Year helped anticommunism transition into antifeminism. Although conservatives began by seeing second wave feminists as “Trotskyites” or dupes of communist subversives, they focused on different fears by the latter seventies and eighties. Suspicion of one-worldism and anti-statism, always part of anti-communist grassroots movements, eclipsed the threat of world domination by the Soviet Union or its satellites {{in the minds of}} many. For these anti-statist activists the federal government’s recent “power grab” in the form of civil rights legislation presented the real potential of federal domination but even more threatening was the loss of sovereignty under the auspices of global cooperation in the United Nations. Older anti-communist fears of atheistic feminists combined with a growing focus on United Nations’ initiatives and collectivism generally to shape the public confrontations between feminist activists and their foes, few more bitter than the Indiana meeting for International Women’s Year. This project also uncovers a feminism organic to the Midwest in which statewide feminist organizations attempted to reconcile their demands with a conservative Republican power structure by agreeing to a “soft touch” approach concerning ERA ratification. This tactic included marginalizing the concerns of women of color, liberationists, and lesbian women. Ironically, the successful ratification struggle in the state led to a fractured and weakened feminist coalition, while empowering conservatives. ^ “Women at the Crossroads” documents the in <b>tandem</b> <b>formation</b> of conservative and feminist organizations in the state and argues conservative opposition did not first appear as part of the Reagan revolution, but shaped feminist demands {{from the beginning of the}} movement. Too, this dissertation expands on the geographic limits of histories concerning second wave feminism and conservatism. “Women at the Crossroads” not only adds to our understanding of the limits and successes of second wave feminism, but further explores how late twentieth century conservatism, forged in dislike and distrust of the New Deal and the welfare state, affected the political possibilities of feminists. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall purpose {{with this}} work is to study the flow past {{particles}} and droplets using numerical simulations. Especially the interaction among particles and droplets have been a main objective as the results are {{to be used in}} order to improve already existing spray models. In order to represent the particulate and droplet phase, the Volume of Fluid (VOF) and the Volume of Solid (VOS) methods are used, respectively. The variations of the drag- and lift-coefficients of two fixed solid spherical particles placed at different positions relative each other is studied for particle Reynolds numbers of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 600. For Reynolds numbers of 100, 300 and 600, both a uniform and a pulsating inflow is applied to investigate the effects of flow field fluctuations. Independent of Reynolds number, particles in <b>tandem</b> <b>formation</b> are found to experience the largest effect in the drag, as compared to the single particle case. Depending on the flow situation in [...] between the particles for various particle arrangements, attraction and repulsion forces are detected. These forces may lead to unsteady dynamics of the particle arrangement. The simulations of the motion of particles near a solid wall show that single and dual particles settling under gravity is clearly affected by the wall. However, for side-by-side arrangements, the simulations show that the particle-particle interaction is stronger as compared to the wall effects. The simulations are carried out for Reynolds numbers in the range from 1 to 1000 and particle to fluid density ratios of 1. 5 to 8. Both the Reynolds number and the density ratio are found to highly influence the falling motion. Simulations of single and dual droplets in a uniform flow for Reynolds numbers 100 and Weber numbers of 0. 1 - 10 have been studied. For single droplets, Reynolds numbers of 50, 100 and 200 for the same Weber number range has also been investigated. The results are used in order to evaluate how droplet deformation can be corrected for in numerical models for droplets. A drag correction function is presented, showing similar trends when compared to other drag correlations found in literature. The results show the importance of accounting for the full interaction among droplets and particles. Such interaction has to be included even for rather dilute two-phase systems. The obtained data has already been used for correcting for the four-way interaction that is usually neglected in current models...|$|E

Starting from l-tryptophan 2, N,N′-dialkylthiourea 4, 4 -[(1 H-indol- 3 -yl) methylene]- 2 -sulfanylidene- 1, 3 -thiazolidin- 5 -one 5 and alkyl (2 S) - 3 -(1 H-indol- 3 -yl) - 2 -{[(alkylsulfanyl) carbonothioyl]amino}propanoate 6 type compounds were obtained as main products in different ratios {{depending on the}} reaction conditions via a <b>tandem</b> dithiocarbamate <b>formation</b> and Michael addition reaction. In {{order to understand the}} dependence of the reaction conditions on the mechanism pathway, a DFT/B 3 LYP study was performed. The results suggested the existence of competitive mechanistic routes which involve the presence of an ionic dithiocarbamate intermediate 9. Antifungal activities of all products were then evaluated against Fusarium oxysporum through mycelial growth inhibition using a microscale amended-medium assay. IC 50 values were thus determined for each compound. These results showed that 6 -related compounds can be considered as promissory antifungal agents...|$|R
40|$|The cladiellins (also {{known as}} eunicellins) are oxygen-bridged 2, 11 –cyclised cembranoids, {{isolated}} from gorgonian octocorals and soft corals. They present an unusual oxatricyclic ring system {{composed of a}} hydroisobenzofuran and an oxonene unit. The natural role of these cembranoids is proposed to involve predatation deterrence, and biologically they {{have been shown to}} exhibit in vitro cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, anti inflammatory properties antimicrobial activities. The Clark group has been interested in the synthesis of cladiellins for some time, and in 2007 Clark and co-workers reported the total synthesis of vigulariol. This thesis describes the investigation of the synthesis of both E- and Z-cladiellins using our general strategy. The key transformations in the synthetic route are ring formation reactions. Firstly, a SmI 2 -mediated reductive cyclisation forms the tetrahydropyran ring, then a <b>tandem</b> oxonium ylide <b>formation</b> [2, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement constructs the oxabicyclo[6. 2. 1]undecenone bicyclic core. Finally, a Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction forms the third ring of the tricyclic core of the cladiellins. Particular interest was given to the <b>tandem</b> oxonium ylide <b>formation</b> [2, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement reaction. This transformation was studied in order to develop conditions allowing the selective formation of the E-oxonene ring needed for the synthesis of the E-cladiellin tricyclic core. Herein, is presented work towards the synthesis of ophirin B, a cladiellin bearing a Z-oxonene alkene, as well as the enantioselective total synthesis of eight cladiellins obtained from an E-cladiellin tricyclic core: (−) -cladiella- 6, 11 -dien- 3 -ol, (−) -cladiell- 11 -ene- 3, 6, 7 -triol, (−) - 3 -acetoxycladiella- 6, 11 -diene, 3 -acetoxy-cladiellin- 11 -ene- 6, 7 -diol, (−) -sclerophytin A, (−) -sclerophytin B, (+) -deacetylpolyanthellin A and (+) -polyanthellin A in 20 to 24 steps from our allylic alcohol precursor.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of careful considerations on the surface facilities at {{one of the most promising}} CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) candidate sites in Japan in regards to process, economy and energy consumption. This site has been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of CCS total system in which CO 2 is captured from natural gas processing plants, transported to the injection site (100  km away from the plants), and then stored in the saline aquifers underneath the seabed of the Japan Sea. Four technical issues have been reviewed for the surface facilities, namely CO 2 transportation, removal of impurities in the CO 2 gas, the liquefied CO 2 heater models and the shaft seal system for CO 2 pumps. As for the CO 2 transportation method, tanker trucks transportation is selected compared to pipelines because of the merits in a construction period, economy, and local citizen’s understanding and acceptance which are crucial for the realization of the project. Concerning process building, removal of impurities contained in the CO 2 gas has been considered first. CO 2 gas separated from natural gas contains hydrogen sulfide, mercury, and BTX in addition to water. These impurities must be eliminated prior to liquefaction of CO 2 because they could interfere with the process as well as for environmental considerations. The adsorption method is found to be effective for removing all these impurities. However, it is also found that adsorbent consumption rate depends largely on the process sequence with which the impurities are eliminated. After reviewing the results, it is found that the most economical sequence to eliminate these impurities is in the order of mercury, hydrogen sulfide, BTX, then water. Liquefied CO 2 heater models have been considered to reduce CO 2 emission. After transportation to the injection site, the liquefied CO 2 is pressurized and heated from − 10  °C to a super critical state of 40  °C in order to avoid phase transition inside the injection tube. Using a heat pump to utilize the heat in the air to improve the energy efficiency, CO 2 emission is substantially reduced by approximately 70 % compared to the conventional method using hot water from a boiler that uses heavy fuel oil. A centrifugal pump will be selected for CO 2 pumps because it can handle large volumes. An effective shaft seal system is the <b>tandem</b> <b>formation</b> using vapor-liquid seal and dry gas seal for the first and the second stages respectively. However, since we have limited experience of this formation at CO 2 pumps in Japan, it is identified as a critical item in the demonstration project...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to explore {{efficient}} synthetic pathways to mono and bicyclic phosphonates (phostones) and to study their reactions and associated mechanistic and stereochemical behavior. The work was divided into two main parts. The first focused on the synthesis of the five- and six-membered ring phostones, 2 -oxo- 2 -ethoxy- 1, 2 -oxaphosphorinane 1 and 2 -oxo- 2 -ethoxy- 1, 2 -oxaphospholane 2. New and improved methodologies for the synthesis of phostones 1 and 2 are presented. The related 3 -alkylated derivatives of 1 (R = Me 13, Et 14, nPr 15, iBu 16, PhCH 2 17, HOCH 2 CH 2 20, HOCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 21, PhCH(OH) 22, Ph 2 C(OH) 23, Ph 2 CH 36) were prepared by the reaction of 1 with LDA in THF at low temperature, followed by treatment {{with a variety of}} alkyl halides or appropriate carbonyl compounds. A study on the stereoselective alkylation of 1 and a mechanistic discussion of these reactions is presented. In addition, the X-ray crystal structures of the cis isomer 22 a, and the cis and trans isomers 23 a and 23 b were determined. The crystal structure of 23 a showed an interesting intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the form O-H [...] . O = P that was not present in 23 b. Compound 23 also underwent a series of unusual intramolecular rearrangements to form a phosphorylated tetrahydropyran ring. The second part of this work was devoted to the synthesis of 1 -phospha- 2, 10 -dioxabicyclo (4. 4. 0) decane- 1 -oxide 3, 1 -phospha- 2, 9 -dioxabicyclo (4. 3. 0) nonane- 1 -oxide 4, and analogues of bicyclic phostone 3 with substituents at carbon six. These compounds were obtained by two different methods. The first method was effected by the ring closure of alcohols 20 and 21 under basic reaction conditions (LiH/benzene, EtONa/DME). Substituted bicyclic phostones were obtained by alkylation of the ylide derived from 3. The second method involved <b>tandem</b> <b>formation</b> of two consecutive C-C bonds from bis-(3 -bromopropyl) alkylphosphonates in the final, key step. All the synthetic approaches to these bicyclic phostones led to the same cis stereoisomer. This was confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure and comparison of the spectroscopic data of the compounds. The trans isomer 3 b was obtained from equilibration of 3 a by deprotonation-reprotonation of the acidic α-proton. A discussion of the mechanism and possible causes for the exclusive formation of the cis isomer 3 a is presented. All new compounds have been fully analyzed and characterized by 1 H, 13 C, 31 P NMR, IR, MS spectroscopy and combustion analysis...|$|E
40|$|After the {{successful}} {{participation in the}} Shuttle missions SIR-C / X-SAR and SRTM, the first national SAR mission TerraSAR-X opened {{a new era in}} the German Space Programme and provided a major push for our R-and-D activities on high resolution X-band SAR. TerraSAR-X will be launched in June 2007 will supply high-quality radar data for purposes of scientific observation of the Earth for a period of at least five years. At the same time it is designed to satisfy the steadily growing demand of the private sector for remote sensing data in the commercial market. In this spirit, the proposal to add a second, almost identical spacecraft (TDX), to TerraSAR-X (TSX) and to fly the two satellites in a closely controlled <b>tandem</b> <b>formation</b> building a single-pass SAR-interferometer with adjustable baselines in across- and in along-track directions was born. With typical across-track baselines of 200 - 400 m DEMs according to the High Resolution Terrain Information (HRTI) - 3 standard will be generated. TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are being implemented in a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and EADS Astrium GmbH. TSX features an advanced high-resolution X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar based on the active phased array technology which allows the operation in Spotlight-, Stripmap- and ScanSAR Mode with various polarizations. It combines the ability to acquire high resolution images for detailed analysis as well as wide swath images for overview applications. In addition, experimental modes like the Dual Receive Antenna Mode allow for full-polarimetric imaging as well as along-track interferometry, i. e. moving target identification. TDX has SAR system parameters which are fully compatible with TSX, allowing not only independent operation from TSX in a mono-static mode, but also synchronized operation (e. g. in a bi-static mode). The HELIX concept provides a save solution for the close formation flight with vertical separation of the two satellites over the poles and adjustable horizontal baselines at the ascending/descending node crossings. Beyond the generation of a global HRTI- 3 DEM as the primary mission goal, local DEMs of even higher accuracy level (HRTI- 4) and applications based on Along-Track Interferometry (ATI) like measurements of ocean currents, sea ice drift and glacier flow are important secondary mission objectives. Along-track interferometry will also allow for innovative applications to be explored and can be performed by the so-called dual-receive antenna mode on each of the two satellites and/or by adjusting the along-track distance between TSX and TDX to the desired value. Combining both modes will provide a highly capable along-track interferometer with four phase centers. The different ATI modes will e. g. be used for improved detection, localisation and ambiguity resolution in ground moving target indication and traffic monitoring applications. Furthermore, TanDEM-X supports new SAR techniques, with focus on multi-static SAR, polarimetric SAR interferometry, digital beam forming and super resolution...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} PhoP of the PhoP-PhoR two-component {{signaling system}} orchestrates a complex transcription program and {{is essential for}} the growth and virulence of the tubercle bacillus. PhoP comprises a phosphorylation domain at the amino-terminal half and a DNA-binding domain in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein. We show here that the protein recognizes a 23 -bp sequence of the phoP upstream region comprising two adjacent direct repeat motifs believed to promote transcription regulation. DNA binding, which involves the recruitment of two monomeric PhoP molecules, was dependent on conserved adenines of the repeat sequences and the orientation of the repeat motifs relative to each other. Although response regulators such as PhoB and FixJ dimerize upon phosphorylation, we demonstrate here that PhoP dimerization can also be stimulated by DNA binding. Using the established asymmetric tandem binding model by members of the OmpR/PhoB protein family as a guide, we set out to examine intermolecular interactions between PhoP dimers by protein cross-linking. Our results are consistent with a model in which two PhoP protomers bind the duplex DNA with a symmetric head-to-head orientation to project their N termini toward one another, arguing against previously proposed head-to-tail <b>tandem</b> dimer <b>formation</b> for members of the OmpR/PhoB protein subfamily.

40|$|During gastrulation, {{there are}} very {{important}} morphogenic pathways that are responsible physically shifting and reshaping a cell {{in preparation for the}} embryo’s future development. Two such pathways are the T 48 and fog pathways, which work in <b>tandem</b> during the <b>formation</b> of the ventral furrow in Drosophila embryos to recruit actin and myosin to apically constrict the ventral cells, allowing their invagination and the formation of the mesoderm to occur. However, the fog expression levels during ventral furrow formation between Drosophila species differ, suggesting that the genetic differences may result in some physical variation between the species An analysis of T 48 expression levels between the neighboring Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura during ventral furrow formation reveals that T 48 expression levels are the same between the species, indicating that fog plays a very large role in the gastrulation differences found in Drosophila and is evolving fairly rapidly across the insect species...|$|R
40|$|One {{characteristic}} of genomic plasticity {{is the presence}} of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). High levels of eccDNA are associated with genomic instability, exposure to carcinogens and aging. We have recently reported developmentally regulated formation of eccDNA that occurs preferentially in  pre-blastula Xenopus laevis embryos. Multimers of tandemly repeated sequences were over-represented in the circle population while dispersed sequences were not detected, indicating that circles were not formed at random from any chromosomal sequence. Here we present detailed mechanistic studies of eccDNA formation in a cell-free system derived from Xenopus egg extracts. We show that naked chromosomal DNA from sperm or somatic tissues serves as a substrate for direct <b>tandem</b> repeat circle <b>formation.</b> Moreover, a recombinant bacterial tandem repeat can generate eccDNA in the extract through a de novo mechanism which is independent of DNA replication. These data suggest that the presence of a high level of any direct tandem repeat can confer on DNA the ability to be converted into circular multimers in the early embryo irrespective of its sequence and that homologous recombination is involved in this process...|$|R
