50|$|Thanks to {{the many}} beneﬁts of CDNs, e.g. reduced {{delivery}} cost, improved quality of experience (QoE), and increased robustness of delivery, CDNs have become popular for large-scale content delivery of cacheable content. For this reason, CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Internet service providers (ISPs)/network service providers (NSPs) have deployed or are deploying their own CDNs for their own use or for lease, if a business and <b>technical</b> <b>arrangement</b> between them and a CDN provider were made. Those stand-alone CDNs with well-deﬁned request routing, delivery, acquisition, accounting systems and protocols may sooner or later face either footprint, resource or capability limits. The CDNI targets at leveraging separate CDNs to provide end-to-end delivery of content from CSPs to end users, regardless of their location or attachment network.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores issues {{associated}} with perceptions of low-cost housing in Luanda, which despite being {{considered one of the}} fastest developing and more prospective growing cities in Africa, is struggling to cope with a growing population putting extra pressure on an already saturated urban infrastructure. A renewed Luanda is taking shape, whilst the periphery is being gradually populated with thousands of new houses destined to the low-income population, absorbing some of the people displaced from informal settlements (musseques) but also open to those who would not otherwise be able to afford living closer to Luanda's centre. Amongst promises of fulfilment of a "dream" of ownership and adequate living conditions, this research investigates the low-cost housing sector of Luanda as experienced and perceived by the inhabitants/occupants themselves. Using a Participatory Post-Occupancy (PPOA) framework, it combines the <b>technical</b> <b>arrangement</b> of a building appraisal tool with a participatory approach intending to provide an accurate insight into the occupants' satisfaction and the performance of low-cost housing in an informal settlement as well as in a newly built low-cost mass housing development located in the outskirts of Luanda...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the measurement system for quantitative {{investigation into the}} consensual reaction of pupil to light. This reaction is called the pupil light reflex (PLR). The system enables the recording {{and analysis of the}} time characteristics of pupil radius variation during PLR. In the measurement the stimulating light is projected on the left eye in so-called Maxwellian projection but the consensual reaction (i. e., the change in the radius) of the right eye is recorded. As a detection element the system of two linear CCD sensors has been used. Both the linear and the frequency sensitivity is determined by the technical parameters of the sensors and the optical system and are respectively 0. 05 mm and 90 Hz. Moreover, a special <b>technical</b> <b>arrangement</b> makes the results of measurement independent on the horizontal and vertical movements of head relative to the recording system. This arrangement improves significantly the stability of results. In the paper the examples of PLR time characteristics obtained with the presented measurement system are shown. The influence of the time parameters of the stimulating light on the characteristics shape has been analysed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTransition {{of energy}} systems has been under-theorised.

This paper is intended to elaborate further on the reasons. We require better answers to better questions {{about the nature of}} energy regimes and how they resist change. Our present-day socio-technical energy regime is a global integrated <b>technical</b> <b>arrangement</b> based on cheap high-yield energy sources (fossil fuels) with built-in ‘progressive’ social and economic directions. This ‘progressive’ change relies on cheap energy as a resource towards ever greater global integration and economic efficiency. Energy regime change will be not a tinkering at the edges but will require a dismantling of this ‘progressive’ tendency with radical retrogressive economic and social consequences. We conclude a change of our relationship with energy will require the reversal of a contingent ‘progressive’ tendency that is as old as mankind and the necessarily modest building of a new infrastructural apparatus designed to a new ‘end’, or the reversion to previous low or lower demand apparatus based on non-fossil energy sources. Both solutions would imply major social and economic changes which we will deal with in another paper...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} processes {{through which}} the barriers in the Stockholm metro are continuously rearranged. The barriers are in place {{with the purpose of}} securing income, while simultaneously enabling the flow of passengers into the metro. First, I examine the technical components and capacities of the barriers. Second, I outline a variety of actors involved with planning, manufacturing, and maintaining them, and analytically link these actors as comprising an ‘apparatus of public transport’. More specifically, this study focuses on how metro users’ practices are both influenced by, and influence how the barriers are rearranged. I show how this dynamic is enacted in the barrier milieu in metro stations, where also the tension between the purposes of securing income and allowing mobility is negotiated. The ethnographic material includes encounters with metro users, technicians, officials, and politicians in metro stations and other settings, as well as written documentations. In public discussions, the barriers are commonly at issue in relation to fare evasion. From a standpoint where technical, social, and political dimensions are understood as intermeshed, this study casts attention to a variety of practices occurring in the barrier milieu. By exploring how a <b>technical</b> <b>arrangement</b> influences social relations, I aim to raise questions of responsibility with regards to technology...|$|E
