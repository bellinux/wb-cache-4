5|$|Federer and Andy Murray {{have met}} 25 times with Federer leading 14–11. Federer leads 12–10 on hard courts, and 2–1 on grass. They {{have never met}} on clay. The two have met six times at the Grand Slam tournament level, the first {{three times in the}} finals, Federer winning all three of these matches; at the 2008 US Open and the 2010 Australian Open, both of which he won in {{straight}} sets, and at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships in which Murray took the opening set, but went on to lose in four sets. However, Murray won their encounter in the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open, defeating the Swiss {{for the first time at}} a Grand slam tournament in five sets. At the 2014 Australian Open, Federer reversed that result, defeating Murray in four sets in the quarterfinals. The most recent meeting between the <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Major was in the semifinals of the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, where a dominant Federer triumphed in straight sets.|$|E

5|$|Having {{acted as}} captain during the {{previous}} season following an injury to Adam Murray, Constable was appointed captain permanently ahead of 2010–11. He played in Oxford's first Football League match since promotion, a 0–0 draw with Burton on 7 August. His first goals of the season came after he scored <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 6–1 victory over League One team Bristol Rovers on 10 August. Constable finished the season with 17 goals in 46 appearances.|$|E
5|$|He scored {{nine times}} in 40 league games {{in his first}} season, {{including}} <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 home win over relegated Southport on 28 April 2007 in order to seal a play-off place. Eleven days later, in the second leg of the play-off semi-final away to Oxford United, he scored a goal which took the match to extra time and eventually a penalty shootout which his side won. In the final on 20 May at Wembley Stadium, he came on as a 36th-minute substitute for goalscorer Lee Phillips in a 1–2 loss to Morecambe.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E

The injury prevented him from passing a medical at Turkish club Beşiktaş, having already agreed to transfer to them. On 23 January 2012, Costa was loaned to fellow league club Rayo Vallecano until June; he scored four goals in his first three appearances, including <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 5–3 away win against Levante, eventually finishing his loan spell with 10 goals from 16 games.|$|E

Kane set up Christian Eriksen's late equaliser against Sheffield United on 28 January 2015, a goal which put Tottenham into the 2015 League Cup Final. His performances led to him being named as the Premier League Player of the Month for January 2015.|$|E

5|$|Ruffing won 20 games {{during the}} 1936 season. His 3.85 ERA was the sixth-best in the league, and his 20 wins tied him for third place, with Johnny Allen and Wes Ferrell, behind Tommy Bridges and Vern Kennedy. He started Game One of the 1936 World Series against the New York Giants, but lost. The Yankees {{defeated}} the Giants four games to <b>two.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> salary {{dispute with the}} Yankees, Ruffing did not report to spring training, and he held out {{at the start of}} the 1937 season, missing the first month. He signed in May, receiving a $15,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). Ruffing had a 20–7 win-loss record for the Yankees in 1937. He finished with the fourth-best ERA in the league, 2.98, trailing Lefty Gomez, Monty Stratton, and Allen, and his 20 wins were second only to Gomez, who had 21. His performance earned him eighth place in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting. He started Game Two in the 1937 World Series, earning the victory, as the Yankees defeated the Giants four games to one.|$|E
5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single innings. He never took a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E

5|$|The most cycles hit by {{a single}} player in Major League Baseball is three, {{accomplished}} by four players; John Reilly {{was the first to}} hit a third when he completed the cycle on August 6, 1890, after hitting his first <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> week (September 12 and 19, 1883) for the Cincinnati Reds. Bob Meusel became the second man to complete three cycles, playing for the New York Yankees; his first occurred on May 7, 1921, the next on July 3, 1922, and his final cycle on July 26, 1928. Babe Herman accomplished the feat for two different teamsthe Brooklyn Robins (May 18 and July 24, 1931) and the Chicago Cubs (September 30, 1933). Adrián Beltré is the most recent addition to this list, cycling first for the Seattle Mariners (September 1, 2008) before cycling twice {{as a member of the}} Texas Rangers (August 24, 2012 and August 3, 2015). Beltré is the only player to have completed all three cycles in the same ballpark, with the first occurring as an opponent of the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park in Arlington.|$|E
5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war in 1919, County Championship matches were reduced from three days to <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> one-season experiment. Following the deaths of Booth in the war and Alonzo Drake from illness, {{as well as the}} decline in the bowling of the aging George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an {{effective}} attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main bowler. He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12. This placed him third in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat he scored three centuries and reached 1,135 runs at 29.10. His performances earned him a place in the Gentlemen v Players match at the end of season during the Scarborough Festival, although he neither took a wicket nor scored. Kilner's brother Norman also played for Yorkshire in 1919, although he was ultimately unable to secure a permanent place in the team.|$|E
5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the first time in three months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the table with a 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E
