25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.|$|E
25|$|Sport bikes {{have high}} footpegs that {{position}} the legs {{closer to the}} body to improve ground clearance when cornering, and a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank.

25|$|In a report, {{published}} in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the University College London, and Widex, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, Newcastle was named as the noisiest {{city in the}} whole of the UK, with an average level of 80.4 decibels. The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city's residents. The report was rightly criticised, however, for attaching <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> to readings at arbitrarily selected locations, which in Newcastle's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access. As well as numerous parks, open spaces, and extensive riverside areas, puzzlingly the report also overlooked the 1000 acre Town Moor {{at the heart of the}} city. Larger than London's Hyde Park and Hampstead Heath combined, and even larger than New York's Central Park the town moor dates back to the 12th century, with the land tenure and its use being regulated by an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the gene manipulation lead to worry of toxin production and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E

500|$|Another {{reported}} {{problem with}} the Type UBIs was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes. The boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset {{the loss of the}} C/06 torpedo's [...] weight, but this system did not always function properly; as a result, when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or, if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> was taken on, plunge to the depths.

500|$|The {{next issue}} to be {{addressed}} was the main armament. The General Staff decided in March 1912 to retain the [...] gun of the Bretagne class. They chose the new quadruple turret and advocated an armament of twelve guns in two quadruple and two double turrets. If this arrangement placed <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> on the bow and stern, the arrangement of five twin turrets as in the Bretagne-class battleships would be substituted. In April 1912, the Naval Supreme Council accepted the latter design, unless the quadruple turret could be readied by the time construction was scheduled to begin. The armor layout of the Bretagne class was to be retained, though {{an increase in the}} thickness of the main belt was to be effected if possible.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day it}} {{was first}} tested the water was allowed to flow in, but one of the arches began to buckle under the weight. Brindley, {{overcome}} with anxiety, retired to his bed at the Bishop Blaize tavern in nearby Stretford. Gilbert, realising that Brindley had placed <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> {{on the sides of the}} arch, removed the clay and laid layers of straw and freshly puddled clay; when the water was allowed to flow in again the masonry held firm. According to a statement by Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater printed in 1820, his uncle, the duke, had told him that there was a distortion of one of the arches, and that Gilbert had addressed the problem by placing [...] more weight on the crown of the arch and less on the haunches. The arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until the following spring, when the mortar was set and the arch had become stable, but its curve remained irregular.|$|E
500|$|SM UB-15 was {{commissioned}} into the German Imperial Navy {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg on 11 April. An Austro-Hungarian Navy officer was assigned to the boat for piloting and training purposes. On 10 June, UB-15 sank the Italian submarine Medusa for a loss of 245 tons off Porto di Piave Vecchia in the Northern Adriatic. Like all Type UB I and U-10 class submarines, UB-15 was equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of one of the [...] C/06 torpedoes. However, they did not always function correctly; when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or, if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> was taken on, plunge to the depths.

50|$|In 1943, {{the thick}} armor {{of the new}} German Tiger and Panther tanks had {{rendered}} the F-34 gun obsolete, and experiments were conducted to find a replacement. The better-penetrating 57 mm ZiS-2 high velocity antitank gun was installed on some T-34/57 tanks, but the smaller-bored gun couldn't fire an adequate high explosive round for general use. A more heavily armoured T-34 prototype was built, the T-43, {{but it was still}} vulnerable to the Tiger's 88, and its mobility suffered <b>too</b> <b>much</b> from the <b>weight</b> of armour.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{aimed to explore}} the {{experiences}} of clients with chronic anorexia nervosa. Six women with recurring difficulties of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) {{for over a decade}} were interviewed regarding their experiences of their eating disorder and of their treatment. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The results identified the functional role of AN to resolve complex underlying psychological difficulties (in particular a lack of sense of self and search for identity), and the role of unhelpful treatment experiences and negative relationships with staff in the maintenance of AN. The themes provide an insight into the problems of women who struggle with their eating disorder for many years. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed {{in the context of the}} need for services to move away from focussing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> on <b>weight</b> and eating, towards facilitating clients to address the underlying issues of the disorder...|$|R

500|$|Researchers have {{variously}} {{suggested that}} Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, syphilis, giant-cell arteritis, and tinnitus. In a report {{prepared for the}} OSS in 1943, Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a [...] "neurotic psychopath". In his 1977 book , historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder. Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered {{from a number of}} illnesses including Parkinson's disease, Hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions. Theories about Hitler's medical condition are difficult to prove, and placing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of Nazi Germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual. Kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of German history by examining what social forces led to the Nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the Holocaust and World WarII based on only one person.|$|E
500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has always been {{interested}} in creating open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom.

500|$|While {{some of the}} {{ideologies}} of self-government espoused by the comuneros seem to prefigure later democratic uprisings against Spanish colonial rule, especially among the rural branch of the revolt, historians Adalberto López and James Schofield Saeger caution that giving this apparent resemblance <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> would be a mistake. [...] According to Saegar, the revolt was much closer to traditions of the 16th and 17th centuries and [...] "was principally a local uprising led by local vested interest groups and unrelated to the important changes in the Spanish empire beginning in the 18th century." [...] It had {{little in common with}} the Revolt of the Comuneros of New Granada or the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II that occurred in the 1780s. [...] López agrees that the Revolt of the Comuneros was not a [...] "true revolution" [...] that aimed at fundamental change in Paraguay; most of the Paraguayans saw themselves as loyal servants of the Crown and were not attempting to fundamentally change the political or economic structure of the province. [...] Rather, they were attempting to assert control over the Jesuits, who were seen as undermining the province and exacerbating its poverty.|$|E

5000|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{suspended}} ships resumed in 1954, to a revised design known as the Tiger class, as a platform to mount new automatic 6-inch and 3-inch guns. It had always been intended to fit a tertiary battery of 40mm CIWS guns as a needed backup to guarantee available weapons to counter head on air attack over the bow with ac STAAG Mk 2 and then twin L70s under the bridge wings, but both systems were abandoned by the RN in 1959 and the twin L60/MRS8 fitting to Hermes and Belfast in 1959 required <b>too</b> <b>much</b> space, <b>weight</b> and crew and ruined the modern RN image.

The bombardment lasted for over two hours, during which time the force made six passes across the mouth of Kamaishi's harbor and fired 802 [...] shells, 728 [...] shells and 825 [...] shells. While most of the shells landed within the grounds of the ironworks, the concussion from their explosions caused kitchen fires to break out across Kamaishi. The resulting smoke prevented US Navy aircraft from being able to support or spot for the warships, which continued to fire accurately on predetermined targets. No Japanese aircraft or coastal guns responded to this bombardment. Allied aircraft photographed the ironworks following the attack, but photo interpreters underestimated {{the extent to which they}} had been damaged. This was one of the first times that the Americans had used aerial photography to assess damage from a naval bombardment, and the interpreters placed <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> on the fact that none of the ironworks' buildings had been destroyed. The Allies learned after the war that the ironworks had been extensively damaged and forced to cease production for a period.

Ledburys gunner, {{who was in charge of}} the towing party on board the tanker tried out all the tanker's guns, which proved valuable as at 10:44 the flotilla was attacked by nine Stukas. Just before the attack, American survivors from the merchantman Santa Elisa asked Commander Hill to take a party aboard Ohio to repair and man one of the anti-aircraft guns, an offer gratefully accepted by Ledburys captain. In the attack, Ledbury received a near miss within a few feet of the fo'c'sle, which fortunately was an oil bomb and caused no casualties. There was also a near miss astern. Help was however on the way, since Malta based Spitfires covered the ships and broke many enemy formations. This was the last successful attack, and Ledbury, Penn and Bramham secured either side of the tanker, and by some very skilful seamanship and endurance on the part of the crews brought Ohio into Valletta Harbour.|$|E
