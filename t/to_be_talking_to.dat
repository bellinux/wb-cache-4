5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{parents took}} {{her back to}} Dr Brisbane, {{and by the time}} they arrived back in Glasgow she had begun to pull out of her mouth balls of hair she claimed had been put there by those who were afflicting her. Soon she began to pull other [...] "trash" [...] out of her mouth, {{including}} straw, coal, gravel, chicken feathers, and cinders. During her fits she was sometimes heard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the invisible Catherine Campbell, pleading for a return to their former friendship.|$|E
500|$|In [...] the {{subsequent}} scene, the dais {{at which the}} main persons are seated, covered by misu, is opened and Murasaki Shikibu notes that the people present at the event and seated around the dais on the balcony were either of high rank or court ladies. [...] Lower rank officials later joined them on the steps below where the royalty is seated to perform music with a lute (biwa), harp (koto) and flute (shō). The painting corresponding to this scene shows two ladies on the balcony with rolled up misu. Both are squeezed {{in the corner of}} the image and appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E

6000|$|... "There: I am in for it now," [...] said Lucy, {{handing the}} note over to Mrs. Robarts. [...] "I shall have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> as never poor girl <b>was</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> before: {{and when one}} thinks of what I have done, it is hard." ...|$|R
500|$|Scenes {{four to six}} {{describe}} the 50th day celebration {{of the birth of}} Atsunaga-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Suzaku, on Kankō 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by kichō partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping about other people. [...] Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness. The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (engawa) of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.|$|E
500|$|Terence Stamp's {{name was}} {{deliberately}} {{kept out of}} the opening credits {{in order to keep the}} secret he was voicing Jor-El. Stamp originally portrayed General Zod in the first two Superman films, starring Christopher Reeve. Gough and Millar wanted to provide answers for certain aspects of the Superman mythology, so at the start of season three they tied Jonathan's heart condition to Jor-El, where Jonathan makes a deal with Jor-El to be given the power to bring Clark back. This power ultimately puts a strain on Jonathan's heart. The refusal by the film department to allow Smallville to cast a body as a physical representation of Jor-El forced the special effects crew to come up with a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice which was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Jonathan in season three's [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El's voice, rippling as he spoke. To save money on this effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. At the time of season three's [...] "Memoria", where a scene depicting Jor-El and Lara placing baby Kal-El into his ship before the destruction of Krypton was scripted, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it was going to be an origin story, and as a result was still banning Smallville from showing Jor-El. Millar was forced to take inspiration from comic book scribe Jeph Loeb. In one of Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship. In season nine, the producers were able to provide the character with a physical appearance, and Julian Sands was cast for the role.|$|E
2500|$|In American Psycho {{there is}} {{a scene in which}} Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, having noticed the arrival of Private Investigator Donald Kimball ( [...] William Dafoe [...] ), pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a {{business}} associate on the phone, [...] and says to the fictitious caller, for Kimball's benefit, [...] "You'll have to excuse me - T-Boone Pickens just walked in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Crawford, [...] "and {{do you not}} scold us for our imprudence? What do {{you think}} we have been sitting down for but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{what use}} was Peter {{in a crisis}} of this kind? Peter couldn't scold. Peter couldn't bully. The only person <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Tommy as Tommy knew she needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>was</b> one Jane, a young woman of dignity with sense of the proprieties.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat beside}} her on the window-seat, and we talked of what I was doing, and when it would be done, and of the {{progress}} I had made since my last visit. Agnes was very cheerful; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to,</b> on such subjects.|$|R
2500|$|While on the {{practice}} field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot which was about [...] away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps {{back up the hill}} toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed {{over the top of the}} hill and headed back into the Commons.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The refusal by {{the film}} {{department}} to allow Smallville to show Jor-El forced the special effects crew {{to come up with}} a creative way to display some sort of aid to help the audience visualize this disembodied voice that was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Jonathan in [...] "Exile". They decided to create a force field around whoever was speaking to Jor-El, which acted as Jor-El’s voice, rippling as he spoke. To save money on this effect, the crew filmed John Schneider on a black backdrop, and Entity FX digitally added the force field around him. Wind machines and a spot light were added to help synthesize the atmosphere in the force field. Another aspect of the Superman mythology appeared in season three’s [...] "Hereafter", and was also created digitally: Superman’s cape. In the scene, Clark is touched by a boy who sees the moment of someone’s death; when he touches Clark he does not see Clark’s death but a cape flapping in the wind. Instead of just shooting a practical cape billowing, the scene was developed entirely by a computer. Created primarily by John Hahn, the idea was to show the cape but not so clearly that it would be obvious to the audience what they were looking at. As Beck explains, [...] "You get a hint of the 'S', but not quite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> in this fashion!" [...] cried Asa Lemm, {{bridling}} up. [...] "I {{was not in}} {{the wrong}} at all.

6000|$|Was it the {{speciality}} of Mr and Mrs Lammle, {{or does it}} ever obtain {{with other}} loving couples? In these matrimonial dialogues they never addressed each other, but always some invisible presence that appeared to take a station about midway between them. Perhaps the skeleton in the cupboard comes out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to,</b> on such domestic occasions? ...|$|R

60|$|I {{was angry}} with the man, for I <b>am</b> not {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> in that way by Kafirs, but somehow he impressed me, and besides I <b>was</b> curious <b>to</b> know {{what he had to}} say. So I translated, expressing my opinion {{at the same time that}} he was an impudent fellow, and that his swagger was outrageous.|$|R
40|$|Sir C. V. Raman {{was a man}} of many moods. His {{love for}} {{research}} matched his desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left alone. So that, he led the life of near-recluse, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> or written about. On the occasion of the birth centenary of the first Indian Nobel laureate in science, G. T. Narayana Rao recalls how he over come heavy odds and managed to penetrate the scientist's reserve...|$|R
60|$|There Joe cut himself short, and {{informed}} me that I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> in great moderation, and that I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.|$|R

60|$|She didn't {{appear to}} be listening, but she was, and he didn't appear, on his part, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her, and he kept his voice as hard and dry as he could.|$|E
6000|$|He {{really had}} no breath to spare, and it <b>was</b> very {{alarming}} <b>to</b> see him laugh. When he was again in a condition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to,</b> I thanked him for the proffered refreshment, which I declined, as I had just had dinner; and, observing that I would wait, since he was so good as to invite me, until his daughter and his son-in-law came back, I inquired how little Emily was? ...|$|R
60|$|RAINA. Yes, I suppose I do mean that. (Cosily, quite at her {{ease with}} him.) How strange it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{in such a}} way!
