25|$|The Sensor Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, left-right motion of a cursor or reticle on the TV screen {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because the Sensor Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors),</b> the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors with a {{flexible}} plate {{can be used}} to measure strain or pressure. Industrial pressure transmitters used for process control use pressure-sensing diaphragms, which form a capacitor plate of an oscillator circuit. Capacitors are used as the sensor in condenser microphones, where one plate is moved by air pressure, relative to the fixed position of the other plate. Some accelerometers use MEMS capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector. They are used to detect changes in acceleration, in <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors,</b> or to detect free fall, as sensors triggering airbag deployment, and in many other applications. Some fingerprint sensors use capacitors. Additionally, a user can adjust the pitch of a theremin musical instrument by moving their hand since this changes the effective capacitance between the user's hand and the antenna.|$|E

2500|$|The gamepad {{includes}} dual thumb {{sticks and}} a pair of <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors.</b> Pointman uses the thumb sticks to turn the avatar's body and set the stepping direction. The tilt of the gamepad is mapped to control how the virtual rifle is held. The user tilts the gamepad down to lower the rifle, and tilts the gamepad up to continuously raise the rifle up through a low ready into an aim and then to a high ready. [...] This allows users to practice muzzle discipline, by lowering the rifle to avoid muzzle sweeping friendlies, minimizing collisions when moving through tight spaces, or leading with the rifle when moving around cover. [...] Once the rifle is raised into an aim position, the user's head motion aligns the sight picture. [...] The user rolls the gamepad (tilting it side to side) to cant the weapon. Gamepad buttons are mapped to control various weapon operations (including firing and reloading) and aiming functions (such as the optic zoom level).|$|E
2500|$|Most tunicates {{appear as}} adults in two major forms, {{both of which}} are soft-bodied filter-feeders that lack the {{standard}} features of chordates: [...] "sea squirts" [...] are sessile and consist mainly of water pumps and filter-feeding apparatus; salps float in mid-water, feeding on plankton, and have a two-generation cycle in which one generation is solitary and the next forms chain-like colonies. However, all tunicate larvae have the standard chordate features, including long, tadpole-like tails; they also have rudimentary brains, light sensors and <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors.</b> The third main group of tunicates, Appendicularia (also known as Larvacea) retain tadpole-like shapes and active swimming all their lives, and were for a long time regarded as larvae of sea squirts or salps. The etymology of the term Urochorda(ta) (Balfour 1881) is from the ancient Greek οὐρά (oura, [...] "tail") + Latin chorda ("cord"), because the notochord is only found in the tail. The term Tunicata (Lamarck 1816) is recognised as having precedence and is now more commonly used.|$|E

With the measurement tilt increases, {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor</b> decreases seriously. As a result, the tilt measurement range is restricted. A closed loop dual-axis measurement system which is mainly constructed by dual-axis acceleration sensor, microprocessor, and digital potentiometer is proposed to come over this problem.

Finally, a real dual-axis tilt measurement system experimental platform is constructed, which achieves the sensitivity automatically adjustment.
